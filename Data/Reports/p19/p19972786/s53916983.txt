                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, fatigue
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac silhouette size
 remains moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged.  Linear and patchy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion
 appears relatively unchanged compared to the previous study.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Degenerative
 changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 Continued bibasilar atelectasis.
