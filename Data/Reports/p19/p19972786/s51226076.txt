                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumothorax with chest
 tube clamped (airleak noted)
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___. Mediastinal drains and
 bilateral chest tubes are again seen.  There has been removal of the
 endotracheal tube and feeding tube since the previous study.  No
 pneumothoraces are identified. There are low lung volumes due to poor
 inspiratory effort and some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Patchy
 opacities at the lung bases may be due to atelectasis, early infiltrate, or
 aspiration, but are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is  cm above the carina, appropriately sited.
 There is a  sided central venous line with distal tip in the .  There is an
 enteric tube with sideport and tip below the GE junction.
 
 Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
 pneumothoraces.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Heart size and mediastinal
 structures are within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
