                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ 4.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a small
 residual right-sided loculated pleural effusion but decreased with associated
 streaky opacities suggesting minor associated atelectasis.  Overall, however,
 aeration is much better than the more recent of the prior radiographs.  Mild
 degenerative changes affect the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Atelectasis at the right lung base with small but decreased pleural effusion.
