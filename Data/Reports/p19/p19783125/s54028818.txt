  Increased opacity of the right the lower and mid lung likely represents
  layering pleural effusion due to positioning.  Retrocardiac opacity likely
  represents a combination of effusion and atelectasis; although, an underlying
  infection is possible in the correct clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary
  vascular congestion persists.  Heart size remains severely enlarged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is a hazy opacification at
 the right base consistent with layering pleural effusion, which may be
 different in appearance due to change in patient position.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is more prominent, consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Engorgement of the azygos region suggests
 some element of right-sided cardiac failure.
