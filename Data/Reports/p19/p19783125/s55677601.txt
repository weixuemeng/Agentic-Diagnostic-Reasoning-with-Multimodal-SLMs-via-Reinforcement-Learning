                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, persistent crackles, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusion on the
 right has minimally increased in extent.  This increase is more obvious on the
 frontal than on the lateral image.  The effusion on the left is unchanged in
 size.  Minimal increase in size of the cardiac silhouette.  To rule out a
 potential pericardial effusion as a reason for this change, echocardiography
 could be performed.
 
 Minimal areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases.  No
 evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
