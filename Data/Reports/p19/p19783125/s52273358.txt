                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with respiratory distress.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___ at 5:27 p.m.
 
 The current examination demonstrates that the patient is now in mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as
 well as there is no change in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal
 consolidations and cardiomegaly.  The left mid lung opacity is currently
 obscured by pulmonary edema after diuresis, but after diuresis attention to
 this area to exclude possibility of the developing infection is required.
