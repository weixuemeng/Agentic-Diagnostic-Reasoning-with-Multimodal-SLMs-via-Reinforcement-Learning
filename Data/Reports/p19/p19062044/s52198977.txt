                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of COPD, now with productive cough
 and rales on exam.  Clinical concern for left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Hyperinflated lungs reflect
 underlying COPD.  New bronchial cuffing and fine linear opacities at the left
 base may reflect aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Similar opacities
 were seen at the right base on ___ with subsequent resolution on later
 radiographs and this pattern of rapidly emerging and resolving basilar
 opacities suggests recurrent aspiration.  Normal pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bronchial cuffing and recurrent linear opacities at the left base likely
 reflect repeat aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Suggest close
 follow-up to evaluate possible early broncho pneumonia
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Suggest close follow-up to evaluate possible early broncho
 pneumonia
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 16:20.
