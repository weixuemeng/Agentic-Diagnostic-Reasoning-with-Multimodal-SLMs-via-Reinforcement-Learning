                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with congestion and cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is mild lower thoracic spine levoscoliosis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged, and within normal limits.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  Aortic arch calcifications are again seen.  Mild diffuse
 interstitial prominence may relate to chronic age-related changes, unchanged
 in comparison to prior radiographs.  There may be mild diffuse peribronchial
 wall thickening, suggestive of small airways inflammation.  No focal lung
 consolidations are seen.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild peribronchial cuffing may represent small airways inflammation in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Hyperinflated lungs, as on prior.  No focal
 lung consolidations.
