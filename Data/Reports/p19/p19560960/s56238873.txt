                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia, hypotension from dialysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged with calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes
 again demonstrated compatible the patient's history of sarcoidosis.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky and linear opacities within the
 lingula and left lower lobe appear similar compared to the previous exam, and
 may reflect areas of scarring and/or atelectasis.  Minimal patchy opacity
 within the right lung base could reflect infection or atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity within the right lung base could reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Probable scarring or linear atelectasis within the
 left lung base.
