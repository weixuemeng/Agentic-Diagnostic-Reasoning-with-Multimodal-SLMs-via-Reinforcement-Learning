                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever with crackles at the left lung base.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate an ill-defined opacity within
 the posterior left lower lobe, compatible with pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  The lungs are otherwise well expanded with no evidence of
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous, and
 unchanged.  Additionally, a small hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  The
 heart size is stable.  Multiple healed left-sided rib fractures are again
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Ill-defined opacity in the posterior left lower lobe, could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
