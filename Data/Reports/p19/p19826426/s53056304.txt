                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Depression.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Small hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  The aorta
 is mildly tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications diffusely. 
 Hilar contours are stable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal
 linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.  Mild loss of height of an upper
 lumbar vertebral body is unchanged, as are several remote left-sided rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Small hiatal hernia.
