                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent pneumonia, weakness, and pre-syncope. 
 Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate the
 lungs are well expanded, with no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
 or pulmonary edema.  Right apical pleural thickening and aortic knob
 calcifications are noted.
 
 A poorly localized opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view may be due to summation artifact from overlying structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
