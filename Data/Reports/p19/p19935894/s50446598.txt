 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with Vision loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated
 suggesting underlying COPD. Vague opacity projecting over the right lung base
 on the frontal projection does not have a correlate abnormality on the lateral
 projection and appears unchanged suggesting the possibility of a prominent fat
 pad. Otherwise the lungs are clear. No effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
 stable and mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable COPD with hazy opacity at the right medial lung base thought to
 represent a prominent fat pad.
