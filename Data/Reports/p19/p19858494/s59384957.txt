                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  There is a persistent left basilar
 retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms and a moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is also a suspected small right-sided pleural effusion,
 although not definitive.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  A left
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.  A
 pigtail drainage catheter projects over the left lower quadrant.  There is
 also a balloon associated with gastrojejunostomy tube projecting over the left
 mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basilar opacity with pleural effusion. 
 Differential considerations include pneumonia, although atelectasis associated
 with pleural effusion could explain the appearance.
