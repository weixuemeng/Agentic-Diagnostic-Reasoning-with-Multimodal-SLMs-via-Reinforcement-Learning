                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of necrotizing hemorrhagic
 pancreatitis complicated with abdominal compartment syndrome with persistent
 fluid collections and new ___-___ fistula.  Presented on ___ for drain
 upsizing, now with worsening mental status, respiratory acidosis, arrived in
 ICU, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  There is no
 significant interval change between these two studies obtained with a ___-hour
 interval.  The left-sided basal density with obscuration of the left-sided
 diaphragmatic contour persists.  This is explained by patient's pancreatitis. 
 No increased pulmonary vascular congestion and no evidence of new parenchymal
 infiltrates.  Right-sided PICC line in place. High contrast image clearly
 identifies its termination in the lower third of the SVC.  A gas-distended
 stomach can be identified and overlying drainage tubes are seen in the upper
 abdominal area, however, more detailed analysis of the abdomen can be
 performed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no new infiltrates or increased CHF.
