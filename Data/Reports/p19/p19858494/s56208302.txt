                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with postoperative fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is a left PICC, which extends to the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Lung volumes are low and there are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the
 right, likely in conjunction with atelectasis accounting for basilar
 opacities.  There is no new parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia and the
 upper lung zones remain well aerated.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or edema.  Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess,
 though appear unchanged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, with bilateral pleural effusions and 
 atelectasis.  No convincing evidence of pneumonia.
