                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  History of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis with cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased.  Right lower lobe
 opacity has worsened, consistent with almost complete collapse of the right
 lower lobe.  Small right pleural effusion is probably unchanged.  Cardiac size
 is obscured by left pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Right PICC tip is not well visualized but appears to be in the low
 SVC.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
