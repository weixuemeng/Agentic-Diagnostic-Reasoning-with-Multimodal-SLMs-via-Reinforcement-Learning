                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hemorrhagic pancreatitis, respiratory failure, to look
 for progression of the lung disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___,
 acquired almost 24 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip ends approximately 3 cm above the carina and right PICC
 line tip is at cavoatrial junction/lower SVC.  Over the last 24 hours, there
 have not been much changes in the lungs.  Bibasal atelectasis and small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral small pleural effusion and bibasal small atelectasis is
 unchanged over last 24 hours; however, any concurrently associated infection
 cannot be ruled out and its interpretation should be done in conjunction with
 the clinical history.
