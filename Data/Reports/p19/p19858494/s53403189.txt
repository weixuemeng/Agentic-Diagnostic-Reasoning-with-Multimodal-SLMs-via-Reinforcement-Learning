                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube and right PICC line are unchanged in position.  Since the
 most recent prior radiograph, there is no new parenchymal infiltrate or no
 significant interval change.  Opacification of the left base with mild
 blunting of both costophrenic angles most likely represent small amount of
 fluid and atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Left lower lung opacity may be
 due to atelectasis, however infectious process cannot be ruled out. Stable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
