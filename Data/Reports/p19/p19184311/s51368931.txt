                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is left lower lobe opacity, with subtle suggestion of air bronchograms
 on the frontal view, worrisome for pneumonia.  Subtle patchy right base
 opacity may be due to atelectasis or additional site of consolidation.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is a right middle lobe
 linear atelectasis/scarring.  There has been interval removal of a left-sided
 central venous catheter.  Cervical spine hardware is noted but not well
 evaluated on this chest radiograph study.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Subtle patchy right base opacity may be due to
 atelectasis or ___ site of consolidation.
