                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 1 week severe midthoracic pain radiationg
 side ways, worse with deep inspiration. no cough or fever. former smoker.  //
 r/o pulm / pleural / t-spine cause of pain     r/o pulm / pleural / t-spine
 cause of pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___. 
 Is been no radiographic change since at least ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  Heart
 size is normal.  Previous PA and lateral chest radiographs ___
 and ___ showed identical prominence of the pulmonary outflow tract
 on the lateral view and fullness in the AP window on the frontal.  However,
 the pulmonary arteries in both hila are normal size.  This could be due to 
 enlargement of the pulmonary artery, related to elevated pulmonary artery
 pressure, abnormal pulmonic valve, or a case it idiopathic pulmonary artery
 dilatation, or a mediastinal lesion such is a cyst or indolent mass mimicking
 a dilated pulmonary artery.
 
 CT scanning would be necessary to make that distinction and given the
 possibility of pulmonary artery enlargement I would recommend a CTA to exclude
 the possibility of chronic and recurrent pulmonary emboli.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CTA to exclude the possibility of chronic and recurrent
 pulmonary emboli.
