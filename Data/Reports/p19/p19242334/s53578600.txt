                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate right internal jugular catheter placement, in a patient
 in uroseptic shock.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular
 approach catheter terminating in the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal and the lungs well-aerated without pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Subtle opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle could represent
 an early pneumonia.  The visualized abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular catheter terminating in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 Subtle opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle could represent an early
 pneumonia.  Correlate with physical exam.  Follow-up with repeat chest
 radiograph can be obtained as clinically indicated.
