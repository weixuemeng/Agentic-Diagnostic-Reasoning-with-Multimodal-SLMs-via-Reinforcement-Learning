 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Multifocal areas of consolidation in
 the left lung have partially improved, but there are new areas of patchy
 consolidation in the right mid and lower lung.  These findings may be due to
 multifocal pneumonia or pneumonia accompanied by aspiration.  Small left
 pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
