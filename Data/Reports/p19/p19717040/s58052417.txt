                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Smoker with weight loss, assess for lung mass.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring is
 unchanged.  The lower lobes are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  The hila are
 retracted bilaterally, unchanged from prior study.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  A nodular opacity projecting in the right lower
 hemithorax is most likely a nipple shadow, but shallow obliques with nipple
 markers are recommended to confirm this finding.
 
 There is pectus excavatum.
