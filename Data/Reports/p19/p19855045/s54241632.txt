  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 centimeters above the carina.  NG tube
  terminates below the diaphragm.  Lung volumes are low.  Hazy opacification of
  the left lung could represent a combination of atelectasis and vascular
  congestion.  Stable right base atelectasis.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation for tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carina. 
 The nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  The lung volumes are
 low.  Known opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectatic in origin. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
