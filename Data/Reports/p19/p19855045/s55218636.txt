 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Since prior, there has been
 interval improvement of the bilateral pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities,
 right greater than left, may represent atelectasis.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to small right pleural effusion.  Superiorly,
 the lungs are clear and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
