  Lung volumes remain low.  Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis or,
  in the correct clinical setting, infection.  No convincing evidence of

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:18 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in bilateral radiodensity, likely reflecting minimal atelectasis at the level
 of the diaphragms.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No aspiration, no pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  No change in size of the cardiac silhouette.
