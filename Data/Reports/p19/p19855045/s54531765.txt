                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest.  The left lung is
 clear.  Opacity in the right lung base most likely represents atelectasis or
 overlapping soft tissues; however, underlying consolidation or focal pulmonary
 edema cannot be excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Cervical spine hardware is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Opacity over the right lower lung zone most likely represents
 atelectasis however infection or focal pulmonary edmea is not excluded. 
 Further evaluation with deeper inspiration could be obtained if there is
 continued clinical concern for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
