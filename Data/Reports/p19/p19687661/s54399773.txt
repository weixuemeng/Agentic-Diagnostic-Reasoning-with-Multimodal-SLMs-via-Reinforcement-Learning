                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrated Dobbhoff tube with the
 tip in the stomach.  The tube is not post-pyloric.  There is no pneumothorax
 or other complications visualized.  There is moderate pleural effusion on the
 right, unchanged since previous imaging.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion also unchanged since previous imaging.  A consolidation is again seen
 in the right lower lobe medially which is due to radiation changes.  There is
 an enlarged cardiac silhouette secondary to a known pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube with tip in the stomach, otherwise chest radiograph
 essentially unchanged from previous imaging.
