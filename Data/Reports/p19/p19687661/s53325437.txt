                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase
 in transparency of the lung parenchyma, potentially reflecting improved
 ventilation.  At the right lung base, however, a combination of pleural
 effusion and parenchymal opacity persists.  These changes might be consistent
 with pneumonia.  The changes have neither increased nor decreased in severity
 and extent as compared to the previous examination.
 
 A prexeisting retrocardiac atelectasis is less severe than on the previous
 image.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged course and position of a
 nasogastric tube.
