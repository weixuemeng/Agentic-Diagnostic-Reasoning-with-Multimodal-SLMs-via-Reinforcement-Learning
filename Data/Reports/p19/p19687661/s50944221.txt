                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, likely reflecting a
 pericardial effusion as demonstrated on CT of ___.  Marked volume
 loss in the right hemithorax is again demonstrated with inferior displacement
 of the right hilum and relatively geographically marginated opacities in the
 right mid and lower lung corresponding to known areas of post-radiation
 fibrosis and an accompanying pleural effusion, all essentially unchanged since
 the recent radiograph.  Interval improvement in degree of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No new or worsening opacities identified to suggest an acute
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 2.  Stable post-treatment changes in right hemithorax.  Note that an
 underlying infectious pneumonia would be difficult to detect in this
 post-treatment region, particularly on a portable chest radiograph.  If
 symptoms of infection persist, PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful
 to more fully evaluate the lung bases.
