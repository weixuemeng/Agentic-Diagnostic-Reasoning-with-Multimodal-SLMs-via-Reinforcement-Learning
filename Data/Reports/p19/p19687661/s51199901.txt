                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 effusion versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are persistent right-sided
 opacities, consistent with pleural changes and atelectasis status post surgery
 as well as volume loss.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 appear unremarkable.  Pulmonary nodule in the left hemithorax as seen on CT
 from ___ is not seen on today's exam.  Opacity projecting over spine
 in the lateral radiograph is again present and not significantly changed from
 prior exam given differences in technique.  Given the stability, most likely
 this is not a pneumonia, but likely pleural effusion with peristent
 atelectasis. The appearance is not entirely specific, however.  Overall no
 gross change in the earlier exam.
