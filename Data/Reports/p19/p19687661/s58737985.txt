                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with melena and weakness, now requiring
 assessment of Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two upright images of the chest show moderate chronic cardiomegaly,
 unchanged acutely.  A Dobbhoff tube passes into the stomach, and ends out of
 view. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged since late ___. 
 Dependent edema in the right lower lobe has worsened.  The consolidation in
 the right lower lobe appears more typical of atelectasis than pneumonia.  A
 new small left pleural effusion is seen. Interstitial edema in the left lung
 base has worsened since previous imaging.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening heart failure in the context of chronic atelectasis.
 Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis more likely than peristent pneumonia.  
 Dobbhoff tube passes into the stomach and ends out of view.
