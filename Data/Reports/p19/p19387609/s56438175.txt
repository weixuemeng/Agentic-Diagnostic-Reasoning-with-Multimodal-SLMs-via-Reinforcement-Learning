                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough  // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lungs appear somewhat
 lucent and hyperinflated which is likely due to underlying emphysema. Subtle
 opacity at the left lung apex is noted which is indeterminate.  There is also
 apparent shift of the trachea to the right which could in part reflect mild
 rotation.  Given presence of emphysema, a nonemergent CT is recommended to
 further assess for underlying lesion.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia is
 seen.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema with subtle left apical opacity with mild rightward shift of the
 trachea.  Recommend nonemergent chest CT to further assess for possible
 underlying lesion.
