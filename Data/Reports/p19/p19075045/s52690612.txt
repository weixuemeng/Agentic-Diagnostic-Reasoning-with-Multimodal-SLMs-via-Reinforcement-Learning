                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M surgery planned for tomorrow
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median sternotomy,
 aortic valve replacement, and CABG.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Mild upper zone pulmonary
 vascular redistribution is likely chronic without overt pulmonary edema.  Lung
 volumes remain low with streaky opacities in the lung bases suggestive of
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Fusion
 hardware within the lumbar spine is partially imaged as well as hardware
 within the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
