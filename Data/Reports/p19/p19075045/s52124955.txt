                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after CABG and AVR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Aeration in the previously atelectatic or consolidated left upper lobe has
 improved, improvement in the left lung base is less pronounced.  Both are
 presumably due to atelectasis but radiographically one could not exclude
 clearing pneumonia.  Moderate left pleural effusion is still present. 
 Moderate enlargement of the heart is unchanged.  Right lung shows milder
 atelectasis but is otherwise clear.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Transvenous right atrioventricular pacer leads are in standard
 placements.
