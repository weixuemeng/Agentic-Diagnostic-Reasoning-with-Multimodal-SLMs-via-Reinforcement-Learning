                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, evaluate left lower lobe effusion and atelectasis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray at 8:04 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is a pacemaker, sternotomy wires, enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 patchy opacity in left upper zone, increased retrocardiac density consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and a small-to-moderate
 layering left effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear, with minimal
 vascular plethora, but no overt CHF.  Patchy cardiophrenic opacity is slightly
 improved.  No frank consolidation or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly unchanged compared with one day prior.
