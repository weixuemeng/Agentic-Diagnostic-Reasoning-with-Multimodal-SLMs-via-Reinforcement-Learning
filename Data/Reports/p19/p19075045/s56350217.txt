 HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:44 a.m.
 
 A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post sternotomy, with
 mediastinal clips.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but
 probably unchanged.  Again seen is patchy opacity in the left upper zone; left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation; and probable small left effusion. 
 There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. Portion of a right
 shoulder prosthesis incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall similar to the most recent prior film.  Pleural fluid at
 the left lung base may be slightly increased.
