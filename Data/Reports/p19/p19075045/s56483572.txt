                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There may be mild increased aeration in the left
 upper zone.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent with pleural
 effusions, and there is some increase in pulmonary venous pressure.
