                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ ESRD on HD, multiple ortho hardware, aortic valve
 replacement (bioprosthetic), CAD s/p CABG, PPM for sick sinus syndrome, who
 was admitted for MRSA bacteremia and is transferred to the CCU for hypotension
 during anesthesia induction.  // Patient intubated, assess respiratory status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 10:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy with valve prosthesis.  Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above carina.
 Right IJ central line tip is near cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac pacemaker. 
 There is worsening of left basilar opacity.  Left costophrenic angle is not
 fully seen.  No pneumothorax.  Shallow inspiration accentuates heart size,
 pulmonary vascularity.  Pulmonary vascularity has mildly improved. Improved
 right basilar, perihilar opacities.  Right shoulder arthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsened left basilar opacity, may represent atelectasis, consider pneumonitis
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Pulmonary vascularity has mildly
 improved.
