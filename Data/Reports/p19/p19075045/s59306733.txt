                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Portions and exertion x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  No focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which may
 be due to very trace pleural effusions.  There is slight prominence of the
 interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Right proximal humerus hardware is seen
 but not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible trace pleural effusions and minimal interstitial edema.
