                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of heart disease, now with low-grade fever.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, portable, AP view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval development of diffuse, mild to moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema. A focal opacity seen in the right middle lobe may represent
 an early pnemonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Redemonstrated is
 stable moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The patient is status post CABG
 with median sternotomy wires aligned and intact.  A transvenous pacemaker is
 seen with leads terminating in right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Probable right middle lobe pneumonia. Recommend PA/lateral chest
 radiographs to confirm and further characterize the opacity.
 
 2. Mild to moderate, diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions.
