                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of diabetes, now with hypoglycemia.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable frontal radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with
 increased widespread interstitial opacities and Kerley B lines, consistent
 with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions have markedly increased compared to the prior study from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is difficult to assess,
 but appears mildly enlarged, not significantly changed.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema and increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  While thought less
 likely, infection at either lung base is certainly possible.
