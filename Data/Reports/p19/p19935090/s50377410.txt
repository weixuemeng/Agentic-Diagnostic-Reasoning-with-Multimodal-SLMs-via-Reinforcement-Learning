                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pleural
 effusions has decreased.  However, there are new bilateral parenchymal
 opacities that are more severe on the left than on the right.  These opacities
 consist of alveolar densities, associated to increased interstitial markings
 that show curly lines in the right lateral lung periphery.  The asymmetry of
 the changes, despite the predominance of the left side, as well as the
 distribution and the associated increase in size of the cardiac silhouette are
 suggestive of hydrostatic pulmonary edema.  The differential diagnosis is
 favored over pneumonia.
 
 No other relevant change.  The previously placed left PICC line has been
 removed.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 8:26 am on ___ the
 referring physician ___. ___ was paged and the findings were
 subsequently discussed over the telephone.
