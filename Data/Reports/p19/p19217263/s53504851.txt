                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with rib pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  In the right posterior
 ninth rib, there is an edge adjacent to the rib.  This most likely represents
 artifact, but if the patient has pain at this site, this may represent a
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Additional edge at the right posterior ninth rib may be artifact. 
 Correlate with site of patient's pain to evaluate for fracture.
