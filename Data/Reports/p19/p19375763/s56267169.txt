                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and elevated WBC. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral images of the chest.   
 
 The patient is status post right pneumonectomy, unchanged in appearance from
 prior exam.  The left lung is well expanded and clear.  Of note, the left
 costophrenic sulcus is not imaged on this exam, but there is no visualized
 left pleural effusion.  There is no spare the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 obscured by the collapsed 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process is visualized; however, given the persistence
 of symptoms and abscence of findings on serial conventional radiographs, CT
 may be helpful for further evaluation of the postoperative chest.
