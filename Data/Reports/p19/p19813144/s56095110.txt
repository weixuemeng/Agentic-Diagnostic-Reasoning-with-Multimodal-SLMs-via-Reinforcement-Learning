                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with vomiting of blood.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Minimal opacification is noted in the left lung
 base which may represent atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process
 such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting. Recommend repeat imaging after treatment to document resolution.
