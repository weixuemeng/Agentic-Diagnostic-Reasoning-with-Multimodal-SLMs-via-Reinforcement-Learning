                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and ascites.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a persistent patchy left basilar
 opacity.  Given the lack of change, the appearance may be chronic.  More
 generally, there is mild interstitial prominence, perhaps due to slight fluid
 overload or congestion, but not specific; other possibilities include atypical
 infection, airway inflammation, or possibly interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild suspected background interstitial abnormality and unchanged
 focal left infrahilar opacity, accordingly suggestive of longer chronicity. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.  If shortness of breath were to continue
 and the possibility of an underlying interstitial process is of potential
 clinical concern, dedicated chest CT could be considered.
