                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Delirium, to assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but there is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  There is some ill-defined opacification at
 the right base seen posteriorly on the lateral view.  Although this could
 represent merely atelectasis, in view of the clinical history the possibility
 of superimposed pneumonia should be seriously considered.
 
 This information was telephoned to Dr. ___ at 1:45 p.m. on ___ three
 minutes after the observation was made.
