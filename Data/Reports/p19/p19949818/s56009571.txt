                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:01 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fever after ORIF.  Hypoxic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Borderline cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion persists, though I
 see no frank pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  Lower lung
 volumes may reflect infrahilar atelectasis, but early aspiration could be
 responsible and should be followed to exclude developing pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.
