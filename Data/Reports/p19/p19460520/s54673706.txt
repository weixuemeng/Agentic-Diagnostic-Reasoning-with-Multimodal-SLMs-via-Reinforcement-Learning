                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Pneumonia at outside hospital in right upper lobe with tachypnea
 and hypertension.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest and CXR ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 Bilateral diffuse opacities have increased from ___ at 6:55 p.m.  Given
 the short interval increase, there may be a component of pulmonary edema but
 supervening infection cannot be excluded.  Heart size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings likely represent moderate pulmonary edema.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded. Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment.
