                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax or residual pleural
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Following chest tube removal, there is
 no definite evidence of pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications persist, though they may be somewhat decreased since the
 previous study.  The appearance probably reflects a combination of pulmonary
 edema and multifocal pneumonia.
