  ETT 4.3 cm above the carina. Chest tube overlying right hemithorax. Left PICC
  tip in upper SVC, unchanged from prior. Bilateral patchy opacities likely
  pulmonary edema with multifocal infective process. Increaed opacity at the
  right upper lung is concerning for worsening pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
  Trace left pleural effusion.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects 4.7 cm above the carina and
 is slightly too high.  The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  The pre-existing
 left subclavian vein catheter is in correct position.  The right chest tube,
 with minimal surrounding pneumothorax around tube, is constant, as are the
 post-surgical opacities in the right lung.  The pre-existing left-sided
 opacities are constant.  Constant mild cardiomegaly.
