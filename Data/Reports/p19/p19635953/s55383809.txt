                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:41 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new aspiration pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___.
 
 Bilateral upper lobe consolidation is slightly more pronounced today than
 yesterday.  Whether this is due to progression of pneumonia or deposition of
 early edema in a region of pre-existing pneumonia is difficult to say since
 the mediastinal veins are dilated in the supine position.  Heart size is top
 normal, and there may be mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no clear
 edema elsewhere.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Nasogastric tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.
