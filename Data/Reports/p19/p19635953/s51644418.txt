                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status and elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Evidence of the central vasculature may relate to low lung
 volumes although there may be a component of central vascular engorgement.  No
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  Mild
 prominence of the central vasculature may relate to low lung volumes although
 pulmonary engorgement may be present.
