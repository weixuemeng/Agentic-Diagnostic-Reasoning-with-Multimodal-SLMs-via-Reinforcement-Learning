                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever POD2 from spine surgery, evaluate for infectious
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, there has been little change from the radiograph of earlier the same
 day.  Bibasilar opacities appear similar, likely representing atelectasis,
 although short interval stability does not exclude an infectious process.  No
 frank consolidation is seen.  There is probably a trace right pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Density projecting over the left upper
 lobe is consistent with a granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Short interval stability of bibasilar opacities, which likely represent
 atelectasis, however aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
