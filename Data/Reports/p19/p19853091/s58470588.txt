                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status and unsteady gait.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A status
 post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  Somewhat rounded
 retrocardiac opacity is seen with slight lucency within, most likely relating
 to a hiatal hernia; recommend clinical correlation with history of such if
 none, consider nonurgent chest CT to evaluate this.  Posterior basilar opacity
 is seen most best on the lateral view and underlying infection or aspiration
 may be present.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes are seen at the left shoulder
 joint; difficult to exclude trace effusion.
