                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right-sided pleuritic chest pain, wheezing, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits evaluation.  Jewelry in the left nipple projects over the
 left lung base.  There is subtle increased opacity in the lower lungs which
 could represent crowding of bronchovasculature, though the possibility of an
 early pneumonia is impossible to exclude.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacities in the lower lungs bilaterally could represent
 early pneumonia in the correct clinical context.  Low lung volumes limit the
 evaluation.
