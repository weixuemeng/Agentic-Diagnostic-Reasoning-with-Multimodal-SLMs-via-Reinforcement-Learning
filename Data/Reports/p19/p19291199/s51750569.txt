                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again large right
 pleural effusion, with a changed appearance that most likely reflects
 different position of the patient.  There are extensive atelectatic changes
 involving the lower right lung.  Little change in the bilateral hilar
 adenopathy.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
