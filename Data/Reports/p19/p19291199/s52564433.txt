                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 7:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old sarcoidosis and cardiomyopathy status post
 cath, recent pneumonia and bilateral effusions, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 16:40.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 7:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in aeration throughout both lungs, suggesting
 resolving pulmonary edema.  There continues to be a layering right effusion. 
 The left lung is hyperinflated.  More focal consolidation at the right base
 persists which may reflect compressive atelectasis, though superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Heart remains stably enlarged with a cardiac
 stent in place.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged and within normal limits. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, there has been improvement in the
 degree of pulmonary edema.
