                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___, AT 16:40
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sarcoid and cardiomyopathy, status post
 cath with recent pneumonia and bilateral effusions, assess pulmonary process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film, ___, at 16:40 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is a small layering right effusion.  Overall, there is a persistent and
 worsening airspace process within the right lung as well as in the left mid
 upper lung.  These findings may reflect pulmonary edema, although an
 infectious process should also be considered.  Overall, the mediastinal
 contours are stable.  The heart remains stably enlarged.  There is a coronary
 stent in place.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
