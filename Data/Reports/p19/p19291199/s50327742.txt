 HISTORY:  Status post bronch with TBNA.  Significance of the abbreviation is
 unknown.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Opacity at
 the right base has progressed compared with ___ and may represent some
 pleural fluid.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm could also reflect a
 small amount of left-sided fluid.  There is atelectasis at both bases.  As
 before, there is considerable discrepancy in diaphragmatic height,
 considerably higher on the right.  The cardiomediastinal borders are obscured,
 but there is probable cardiomegaly, similar to ___. Known mediastinal and
 hilar adenopathy is only subtly visible on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No pneumothorax detected.  
 2) Cardiomegaly and adenopathy.
 3) Increased right pleural fluid.  Probable small left pleural effusion. 
 Atelectasis at both bases.
