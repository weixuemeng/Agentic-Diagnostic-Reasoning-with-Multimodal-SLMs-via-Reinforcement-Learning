                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right pleural effusion status post
 thoracentesis, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 12:26 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval decrease in size of moderate right pleural
 effusion status post thoracentesis with persistent patchy opacification at the
 right lung base compatible with re-expansion pulmonary edema.  There is no
 definite evidence of pneumothorax.  The left lung remains clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in right pleural effusion status post
