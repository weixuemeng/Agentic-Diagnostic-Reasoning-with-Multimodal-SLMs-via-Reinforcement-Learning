                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath and worsening crackles, to assess for
 worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette and the lungs.  Again there is evidence
 of increased pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite consolidation, though in
 the appropriate clinical setting and pneumonia at the base, especially on the
 right, would have to be considered.
