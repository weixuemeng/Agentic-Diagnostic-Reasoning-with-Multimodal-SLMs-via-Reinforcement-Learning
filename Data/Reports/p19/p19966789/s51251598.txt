                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, refractory to oxygen.  Question
 acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as multiple priors. 
 CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left chest wall port catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  The lungs are well expanded.  There are worsening confluent basilar
 opacities, right greater than left with new patchy opacities in the right
 upper lobe. Diffuse ground glass and linear opacities have also progressed
 since the prior radiograph. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new. There
 is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The bones are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal opacities most confluent at the lung bases
 are concerning for worsening atypical infection and less likely asymetric
 pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
