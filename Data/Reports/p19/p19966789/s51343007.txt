                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary hypertension, HIV with increased dyspnea, evaluate for
 infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is a new
 small right pleural effusion, but there is no pneumothorax or left pleural
 effusion.  There are increased bibasilar opacities compared to the most recent
 prior study.  Additionally, there are subtle increased opacities in the right
 upper lung.  Slight increase in interstitial markings is present.  Again seen
 is a left chest port with tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasilar opacities and new opacities in the right
 upper lung with a new small right pleural effusion concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia. Given additional finding of prominent interstitial markings, PCP
 pneumonia may be considered, although review of the patient's chart indicates
 that the patient is on prophylaxis.
