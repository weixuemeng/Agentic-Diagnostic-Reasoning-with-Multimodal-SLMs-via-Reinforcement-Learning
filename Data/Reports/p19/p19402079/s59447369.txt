                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis, lymphoma, carcinoma,
 possible hepatitis C, atrial fibrillation and dementia, failing to thrive,
 with a white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Frontal views suggest new consolidation in the left lower lobe, but that is
 not really confirmed on the lateral.  As such, it would be reasonable to
 obtain ___ (left anterior oblique) views to get a better look at the left
 lower lobe.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  Pleural effusion minimal if any.  No pneumothorax.
