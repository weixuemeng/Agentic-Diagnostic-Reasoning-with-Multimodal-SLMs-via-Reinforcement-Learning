                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient, bradycardia, AV block.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 There has been no interval change in low lung volumes, standard position of
 lines and tubes, mild cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum and mild vascular
 congestion.  There is increase in bibasilar opacities, consistent with
 increasing atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Right upper lobe opacity is likely
 atelectasis.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  .
