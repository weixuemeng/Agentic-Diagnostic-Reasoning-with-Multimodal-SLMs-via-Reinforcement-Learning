                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 3 hours earlier.
 
 NG tube has been advanced, now the tip is out of view below the diaphragm. 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  ET tube is in standard position.  The
 pacer lead tip is in the right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left
 pleural effusion is small associated with stable retrocardiac opacities
 consistent with atelectasis.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.
