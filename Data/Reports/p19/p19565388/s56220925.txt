                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bradycardia and hypotension, status post
 intubation and transvenous pacer placement.  
 
 COMPARISON: Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is low, with the tip terminating just above
 the carina. Recommended retracting at least 3cm for optimum positioning. 
 Nasogastric tube ends in the proximal portion of the body of the stomach with
 sidehole at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, and recommended
 further advancement.  A right IJ approach venous pacer lead ends at the level
 of the right ventricle. The lung volumes are extremely low.  Mild pulmonary
 congestion is seen.  Small left pleural effusion with likely compressive
 atelectasis of the left lung base is noted.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, with mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax is seen. Old
 healing left rib fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ET tip terminating at the carina, recommended retraction.  
 2.  NG tube sideholes are at the level of the gastroesophageal junction,
 recommended further advancement. 
 3.  Right IJ approach venous pacer lead ends at the level of the right
 ventricle.
 4.  Small left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr.___ at 10:00 p.m on ___ via
