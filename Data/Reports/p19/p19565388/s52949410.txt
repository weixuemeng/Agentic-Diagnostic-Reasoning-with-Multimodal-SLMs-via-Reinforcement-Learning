                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:38 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of CHF and volume load after MI. 
 Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Leftward mediastinal shift suggests that the persistent consolidation in the
 left lower lobe is due to collapse, not pneumonia, accompanied by small
 increasing left pleural effusion.  Right lung is grossly clear.  Perihilar
 opacification in the left could be pneumonia but is more likely atelectasis as
 well.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Right
 jugular introducer ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  No
 pneumothorax.
