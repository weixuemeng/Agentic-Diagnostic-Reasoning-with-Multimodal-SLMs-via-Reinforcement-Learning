                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Suspicious lung consolidation with VAP in a ___-year-old woman.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___ acquired
 approximately 24 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased retrocardiac density and the left lower lung opacity, which likely
 represents a combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation has minimally
 worsened since ___.  On single frontal view, if any of this 
 represents infection cannot be ruled out and needs further clinical
 correlation.  Right lung is clear. A right internal jugular line sheath ends
 at upper SVC.  Heart size is mild-to-moderately enlarged and unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
