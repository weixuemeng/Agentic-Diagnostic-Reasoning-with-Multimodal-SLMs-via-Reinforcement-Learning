 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:38.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette with signs of pulmonary edema in addition the
 parenchymal opacities, likely represent pneumonia.  The retrocardiac
 atelectasis, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
