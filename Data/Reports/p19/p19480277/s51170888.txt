                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AVR/CABG  // eval for pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 01:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal drain have
 been removed.  Again seen is sternotomy, with mild prominence the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, unchanged.  Also again seen is left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.  Minimal atelectasis
 right base is also similar.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle is more pronounced on the
 current film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small left effusion is newly visible.
 2. Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal drain.
 3. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 4. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is similar to the prior film.
 No new area of opacity to suggest new superimposed pneumonia is detected.
