                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tobacco use and cough, intermittent shortness
 of breath.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A new oval ___ x 12mm radioopacity has developed in the right lung at the level
 of the ___ anterior interspace.  There is a suggestion of greater fullness in
 the right paratracheal region of the mediastinum and increase in previous mild
 lobulation of the right hilus both suggesting interval lymph node enlargement.
 Two small calcifications in the left hilus are more radiodense today than in
 ___.
 
 Lateral view raises the question of a second lung nodule also oval in shape,
 ___ x 9 mm at projecting between the sternum and the ascending thoracic aorta. 
 Mild loss of height is present at multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, probably
 a function of patient's age.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is
 normal and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 At least 1, perhaps 2 new lung nodules suspicious for malignancy accompanied
 by an increase in what may have been pre-existing lymph node enlargement in
 the right paratracheal station of the mediastinum and the right hilus.  If
 there are any calcifications in the left hilus, it is possible that the
 lymphadenopathy preseason may not necessarily be related to the new lung
 nodules, due to sarcoidosis instead.  I strongly recommend CT scanning and
 comparison with any pre-existing cross-sectional imaging of the chest.
