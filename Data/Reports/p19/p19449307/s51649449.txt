 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of acute onset cough and
 shortness of breath, infiltrate or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded.  They appear somewhat hyperinflated which may relate to
 good inspiratory effort.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.
