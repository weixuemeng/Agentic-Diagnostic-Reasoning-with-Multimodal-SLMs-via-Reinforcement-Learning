                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sepsis, status post central line placement  //
 post central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 08:23 from outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain persistently low.  Left internal jugular central venous
 catheter tip terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  No
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating
 approximately 4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the left
 hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off the inferior borders of the film. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly improved in the interval.  Patchy
 atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  No large pleural effusion is noted
 however the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 3. Improving mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
