                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  HIV positive with CD4 count of 24, cough, hypotension,
 question PCP.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest are provided.  Overlying
 EKG wires somewhat limit the evaluation.  There is subtle ground-glass
 nodularity in the lower lungs which could reflect pneumonia.  Overall, this
 appearance has not significantly changed from prior.  The upper lungs remain
 well aerated.  No effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodularity in the lower lungs, unchanged, could represent
 pneumonia.
