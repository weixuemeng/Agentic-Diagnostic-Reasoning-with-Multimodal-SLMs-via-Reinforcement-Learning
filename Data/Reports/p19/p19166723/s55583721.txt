                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough  // R/O Iinfiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity projects over the left hilum in the suprahilar region, seen
 posteriorly on the lateral view.  Given differences in projection and
 technique these have not significantly changed.  Additional right basilar
 opacity is slightly more conspicuous on the current exam on the frontal view
 but not clearly delineated on the lateral.  Elsewhere, lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar opacity which given differences in positioning has not
 dramatically changed since prior and is compatible with underlying neoplasm
 with post treatment changes.  Right basilar opacity seen only on the frontal
 view, potentially atelectasis, to be correlated clinically.
