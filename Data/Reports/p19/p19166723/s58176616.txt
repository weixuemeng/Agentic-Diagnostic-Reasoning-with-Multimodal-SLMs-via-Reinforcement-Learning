                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV and shortness of breath, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 Again seen are bibasilar patchy opacities, slightly less than prior study. 
 The previously seen nodular opacity in the left lower perihilar region is
 again seen.  Remaining nodular opacities are not as well visualized today.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in bibasilar opacities which are concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration.  The left lower perihilar nodular opacity is again
 seen but less apparent.  The remaining previously seen nodular opacities are
 not as well visualized today.
