 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most

 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  There are reticulonodular
 opacifications in the bilateral lung bases with an increased opacification in
 the right upper lung.  Findings are concerning for a multifocal pneumonia or
 possibly an atypical infectious process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 evident.  No osseous abnormality is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe and bibasilar opacification as described above,
 likely representing a multifocal infectious process, possibly atypical.
