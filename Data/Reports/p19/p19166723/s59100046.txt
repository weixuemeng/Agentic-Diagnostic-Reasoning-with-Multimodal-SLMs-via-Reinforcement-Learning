                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with HIV, CD4 count of 28 and new spiking
 fevers with cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since previous examination, increased interstitial abnormality
 extends from the infrahilar areas bilaterally into the mid and lower lungs and
 to a lesser degree, in the upper lungs, without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial abnormality is suspicious for pneumocystis
 infection as on the previous examination; however, other atypical infections
 and pulmonary edema can have a similar appearance in this patient without
 obvious cardiac history.
