                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HIV positive and substance abuse, now with chest pain
 and fever.  Evaluate for new pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent one on ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Bibasilar ill-defined opacities are
 reidentified not significantly changed from prior examon  ___.  Of
 note, new rounded opacities are noted in the left perihilar location measuring
 approximately 1.4 and 1.3 cm respectively.  There may also be another rounded
 opacity measuring 1.2 cm in the right upper lobe.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New rounded opacities in the left perihilar region and in the right upper
 lobe in this patient with history of substance abuse raise concern for
 pulmonary infectious emboli. the differential  includes other causes of
 pulmonary nodules.  Further assessment with CT is recommended.
 
 2.  Unchanged bibasilar opacities from ___ raise concern for chronic
 infectious pneumonia, likely from an atypical organism in this
 immunocompromised patient. Chrnoci aspiration or an inflammatory process might
 also account for this appearance.
