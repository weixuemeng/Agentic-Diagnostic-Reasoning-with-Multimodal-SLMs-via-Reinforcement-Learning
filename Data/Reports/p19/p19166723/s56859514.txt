                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough/pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Leftward shift of mediastinal structures is similar,
 due to volume loss in the left lung.  Left perihilar and suprahilar fibrosis
 with bronchiectasis and left lower lobe atelectasis appears grossly unchanged,
 and likely due to prior radiation therapy.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 emphysematous changes noted in the upper lobes.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged left suprahilar and perihilar fibrosis with scarring and atelectasis
 in the left lower lobe, likely due to prior radiation.  No new consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
