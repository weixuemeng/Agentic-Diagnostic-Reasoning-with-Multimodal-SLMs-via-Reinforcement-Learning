                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough 6 days.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.  ___ abdominal and pelvic
 CTs available for correlation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The lungs are slightly hyperinflated.  There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema or pulmonary consolidation.  The right costophrenic angle
 is sharp.  The left costophrenic angle is relatively sharp posteriorly the
 less than the right, and appears blunted laterally.  The ___
 abdominal CT demonstrates prominent epicardial fat as well as linear
 atelectasis or scarring at the base of the lingula, which may account for
 blunting of the lateral left costophrenic angle, as well as slight eventration
 of the left posterior hemidiaphragm which accounts for slightly decreased
 sharpness of the left posterior costophrenic angle.  Dextroconvex curvature of
 the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
