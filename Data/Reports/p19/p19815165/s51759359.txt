                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aortic knob demonstrates mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged, with prominence of the right paratracheal stripe possibly
 reflecting tortuous vessels.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal and the hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.  Multiple
 clips are re- demonstrated within the right lower neck, likely reflective of
 prior thyroid surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
