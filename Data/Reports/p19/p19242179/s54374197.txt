                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are relatively low, and note is made of development of
 coarse reticular opacities within the mid and lower lungs bilaterally. 
 Relative hyperlucency of the upper lobes with the attenuation of vessels may
 reflect coexisting upper lobe emphysema.  A slightly more confluent opacity is
 present in the lingula, partially obscuring the left heart border, and could
 be due to focal scarring, localized infection, or neoplasm.  There are no
 pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mid and lower lung predominant interstitial opacities, concerning
 for chronic interstitial lung disease such as NSIP or UIP.  Recommend
 high-resolution chest CT for further characterization, as well as to evaluate
 a more focal area of abnormality in the lingula.  Findings entered into
 radiology communications dashboard on ___.
