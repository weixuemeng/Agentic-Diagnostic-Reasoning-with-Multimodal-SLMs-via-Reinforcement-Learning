                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  There are diffuse bilateral alveolar
 opacities.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated
 in the right upper quadrant the abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities could reflect moderate non-cardiogenic
 pulmonary edema, though an underlying multifocal pneumonia is not excluded. 
 Continued followup radiographs are recommended.
