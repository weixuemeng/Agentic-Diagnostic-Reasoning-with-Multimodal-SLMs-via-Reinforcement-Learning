                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fungemia and VRE bacteremia  // Evaluate
 for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is a left intra hilar opacity,
 new as compared to the previous study and potentially might represent
 developing infectious process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Attention to this area is recommended and preferably PA and lateral
 radiographs of the chest would be beneficial for pre size characterization.
