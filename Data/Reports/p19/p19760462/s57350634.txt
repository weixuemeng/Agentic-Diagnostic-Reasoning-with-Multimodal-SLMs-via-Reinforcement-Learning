                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with B symptoms, splenomegaly, diffuse LAD,
 pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, elevated inflammatory markers and elevated
 D-dimer.  // Evaluate for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, e/o pulmonary
 embolus. Also s/p L distal acromioplasty and distal L clavicle resection
 (___); evaluate distal clavicle for signs of malignancy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved ventilation of the
 right lung base. However, both the frontal and the lateral radiograph still
 show evidence of a right pleural effusion and the subsequent right atelectasis
 at the lung base.  There currently is no evidence for the presence of
 pneumonia or of nodular structures in the lung parenchyma. The hilar and
 mediastinal ste contours are unremarkable. Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
 Status post partial left clavicular resection.  No evidence of pathologic soft
 tissue swelling or pathologic bony structures in this location.
