                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old smoker w/ L upper posterior chest/rib pain worse with
 palpation  // r/o rib process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size within normal.  No pleural effusions.  A linear density is again
 noted in the anterior right chest.  Narrowing of the transverse tracheal
 diameter. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No apparent chest wall
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Narrowing of the transverse tracheal diameter, probable saber sheath trachea,
 which is associated with chronic lung disease.
