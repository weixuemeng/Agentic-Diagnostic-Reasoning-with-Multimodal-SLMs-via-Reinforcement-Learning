                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with concern for pneumonia on previous imaging,
 now s/p diuresis. WBC slightly uptrending.  // Worsening vs resolution of
 infiltrate, vascular congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged but likely exaggerated related to lower lung volumes. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 obscured secondary to a small left pleural effusion and increasing adjacent
 atelectasis though given patient's current symptoms a superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis though superimposed left
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.
