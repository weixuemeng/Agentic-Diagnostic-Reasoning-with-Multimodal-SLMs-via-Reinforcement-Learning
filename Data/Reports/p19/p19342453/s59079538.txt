                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress  // Interval changes 
 Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 19:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 08:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are bilateral moderate to large layering pleural effusions which limit
 evaluation of the underlying lung parenchyma.  However, there is a suggestion
 that there may be mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac consolidation likely
 reflects lower lobe collapse.  No obvious pneumothorax, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. 
 Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, and nasogastric
 tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is
 not included on the study.
