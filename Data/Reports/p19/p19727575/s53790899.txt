                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment.  The lung volumes are low. 
 This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. 
 There is no mediastinal widening.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 is likely related to low lung volumes.  Mild atelectasis is noted within the
 lung bases.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute traumatic injury
 identified.
