                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for rib fractures in a patient status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___ and chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hyperinflated lungs compatible with emphysema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture
 is identified.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No displaced rib fracture identified.  If there is continued concern,
 dedicated rib radiographs can be obtained.
 2. Hyperinflated lungs, consistent with known emphysema.
