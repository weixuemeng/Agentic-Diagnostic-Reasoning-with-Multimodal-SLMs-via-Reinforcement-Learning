 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, fever, chest pain, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view of the chest provided.  The bilateral

 and lateral views to further assess.  Aside from this, the lungs are clear. 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is stable.  No pneumothorax or
 effusion is seen.  Bony structures are intact.
