                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures.  Question pneumonia or fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  The CT mentioned in the requisition is not available for review.
 
 No comparisons are available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The aortic arch is calcified.  There is moderate elevation of
 the posterior left hemidiaphragm.  Possibly, this reflects a Bochdaleck
 hernia.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests there may be a
 small effusion or scarring.  Patchy interstitial abnormalities may be due to
 airway inflammation or slight congestion, noting peribronchial cuffing.  More
 focal patchy left basilar opacity is nonspecific but could be seen with
 atelectasis.  This could be associated with elevation of the posterior
 hemidiaphragm.  Patchy vascular calcifications are widespread, particularly
 along the aorta.  There are no definite rib fractures.  Thin anterior flowing
 osteophytes are noted throughout the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings of mild interstitial abnormality which may be due to
 slight congestion or airway inflammation.  Patchy left basilar opacity is
 nonspecific but could probably be seen with atelectasis.  No definite rib
 fractures are visualized but CT imaging is more sensitive.
