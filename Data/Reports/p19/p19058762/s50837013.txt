                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pulmonary emboli and question of left pulmonary
 artery erosion on CT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ at 10:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Apparent
 enlargement of the left hilum is likely due to mild enlargement of the left
 lower lobe pulmonary artery due to pulmonary embolism as demonstrated on CT.
 Focal opacity within the left lower lobe is compatible with infarction.
 Streaky opacity in the right lower lobe may reflect an additional site of
 developing infarction or atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is noted. No
 pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are present in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Apparent left hilar enlargement likely reflects mild enlargement of the
 left lower lobes pulmonary artery due to known embolism.
 2. Left lower lobe opacity compatible with infarction. Small left pleural
 effusion.
 3. Streaky right lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis or additional site
 of developing infarction.
