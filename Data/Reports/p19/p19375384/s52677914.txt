                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA of the neck performed two hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Crepitus in the neck, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 There is subcutaneous gas in the supraclavicular region as well as at the base
 of neck and subtle signs of pneumomediastinum as better assessed on prior CT
 neck.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous gas in the supraclavicular
 region.  Please correlate with findings on CTA neck.  No sign of pneumothorax.
