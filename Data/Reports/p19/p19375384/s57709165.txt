                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of mediastinal emphysema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There
 remains subtle signs of pneumomediastinum along the left aspect of the aortic
 arch and left upper cardiac border.  However, the extent appears possibly
 minimally decreased compared to the prior study.  Subcutaneous emphysema is
 again seen at the base of the neck bilaterally and bilateral supraclavicular
 regions as well as projecting over the right scapula.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent pneumomediastinum, possibly minimally decreased since
 the prior study given differences in technique.  Persistent subcutaneous
 emphysema, as above.
