                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible cholangitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-erect.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier in same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild
 cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration to the heart. There is
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may reflect a
 subpulmonic effusion.  There is a new mild interstitial opacity suggesting
 pulmonary edema in addition to a vague but focal lateral right apical opacity,
 the latter unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Focal but vague opacity in the right upper lung, which persists.  When
 clinically feasible assessment with standard PA and lateral radiographs may be
 helpful.  This appearance may be a focal form of edema, scarring but
 potentially pneumonia.
