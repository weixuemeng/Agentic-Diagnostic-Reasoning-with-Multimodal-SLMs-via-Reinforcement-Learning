                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with likely small-bowel obstruction with
 nasogastric tube repositioned after last chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable supine AP chest radiograph shows clear lungs and normal
 heart and mediastinal contours.  Note that the lateral-most left lower chest
 is not included in the view of the film.  The nasogastric tube tip and
 side-hole are both below the left hemidiaphragm and the tip remains directed
 up towards the gastroesophageal junction in the fundus.
