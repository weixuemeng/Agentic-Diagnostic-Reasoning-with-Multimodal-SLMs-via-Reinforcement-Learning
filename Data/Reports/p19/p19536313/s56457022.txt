 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There are increasing patchy and streaky opacities at the right base which
 still most likely represent atelectasis as there has also been interval
 development of a right pleural effusion.  However, pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be entirely excluded.  There is also likely a small left effusion.  The
 left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC.  No
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
