                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP portable)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with shortness of breath, cough, and
 fever; evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No change in the overall position of the left chest a port with its tip
 terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Lower lung volumes are
 again demonstrated and overall unchanged. Slight increased opacification in
 the lower lung bases appear overall similar to the prior exam and suggest
 chronic atelectasis associated with prominent epicardial fat pad, better seen
 on CT. No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits. Multiple known bilateral pulmonary nodules are better
 seen on prior CT.  Stable bilateral rib deformities and associated pleural
 thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
