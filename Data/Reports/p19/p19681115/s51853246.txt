                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with stroke.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semierect frontal view of the chest demonstrates top normal
 heart size, likely accentuated by AP technique.  Apparent mild widening of the
 mediastinum may be related to semi-supine positioning.  Minimal vascular
 congestion is present.  The lungs are relatively well aerated allowing for
 underpenetration.  No pneumothorax or large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
