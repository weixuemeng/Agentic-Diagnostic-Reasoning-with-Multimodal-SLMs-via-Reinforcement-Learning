                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, chest wall tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  3 mm rounded opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects a calcified granuloma.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fractures are seen.  If there
 is continued clinical concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series
 is recommended.
