 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is patchy opacity
 obscuring the left heart border, but unchanged, probably due to minor
 atelectasis.  The heart is normal in size.  Nipple shadows are visualized
 bilaterally.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
