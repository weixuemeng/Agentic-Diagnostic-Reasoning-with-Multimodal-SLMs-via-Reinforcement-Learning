 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:14 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post endovascular AAA repair.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 15:51.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:14 a.m. is submitted.

 with the tip in the right brachiocephalic seen.  There is a graft within the
 ascending aorta in this patient status post endovascular repair of an
 aneurysm.  Left superior mediastinal opacity likely corresponds to a dilated
 tortuous aorta as demonstrated on the CT dated ___.  There is worsening
 pulmonary edema with increasing consolidation at the left base with an
 associated effusion which likely represents compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, heart remains stably enlarged. 
 Bilateral shoulder replacements.
