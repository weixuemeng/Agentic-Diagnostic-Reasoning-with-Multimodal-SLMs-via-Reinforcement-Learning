                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new productive cough  // Volume overload
 versus pneumonia?      Volume overload versus pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with
 previous CABG and TAVR procedures.  There may be mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure with retrocardiac opacification consistent with atelectatic
 changes.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Elliptical opacification at the right base most likely
 represents fluid in the fissure.
