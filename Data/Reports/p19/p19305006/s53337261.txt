  bilateral opacities are unchanged. ETT ends 6.5 above the carina and could be
  advanced for better seating. OGT goes below the diaphragm although tip is not
  seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with NSTEMI status post intubation for cardiac cath,
 hypertensive following intubation probably aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Right upper lobe opacities have increased.  Right lower lobe opacities are
 unchanged.  This has a wide differential diagnosis but includes aspiration,
 asymmetric edema, atelectasis and layering pleural effusion.  Widened
 mediastinum is stable.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is out
 of view below the diaphragm.  The tip of the ET tube is 6.5 cm above the
 carina.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Left lower lobe opacities could be due
 to atelectasis and/or aspiration.  If any, there is a very small left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
