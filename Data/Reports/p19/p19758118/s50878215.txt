                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure, but the degree of pulmonary edema has decreased
 since the previous study.  Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is again obscured, consistent with pleural effusion and
 atelectasis at the left base.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
