 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is widespread opacification of the right lower hemithorax
 including a suspected large pleural effusion on the right with an expansile
 appearance.  There may be a corresponding consolidation or extensive
 atelectasis involving the right lower lobe and possibly parts of the right
 middle and upper lobe.  The lenticular shape of right mid lung opacity could
 potentially be seen with a loculated pleural effusion, but a mass could also
 be considered.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The left costophrenic sulcus is excluded, but there is no
 evidence of abnormality in the left hemithorax.  Mild mass effect with
 leftward shift of midline structures is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 bone destruction is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread opacification of the right mid-to-lower hemithorax
 with mass effect, suspected to represent a pleural effusion at least in part,
 including a possible large loculated component; a mass could also be
 considered, in addition to widespread atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.
