                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with empyema with manipulation of pigtail catheter. 
 
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 The right pigtail catheter now is almost straight, with small distal loop.
 Right PICC tip is in the low SVC.  There are low lung volumes.  
 
 Right lower lobe opacity a combination of consolidation and pleural effusion
 has increased.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation has worsened
 consistent with worsening atelectasis and/or pneumonic consolidation.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by
 the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.
