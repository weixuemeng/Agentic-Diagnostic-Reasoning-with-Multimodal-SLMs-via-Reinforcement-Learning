                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision three weeks previously, to assess for rib
 fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.  There does appear to be some irregularity about
 several of the mid thoracic ribs in the mid axillary line.  These could
 reflect healing rib fractures.  Elevation of the distal right clavicle with
 respect to the acromion is again seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
