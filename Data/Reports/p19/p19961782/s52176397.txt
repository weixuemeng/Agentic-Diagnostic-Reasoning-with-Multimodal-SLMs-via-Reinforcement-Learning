                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a large pelvic mass, elevated white count and
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small region of peribronchial opacification at the base of the right lung
 could be either atelectasis or a very small pneumonia.  Low lung volumes make
 it difficult to exclude very mild interstitial edema, but there has been no
 increase in mild cardiomegaly, nor is there substantial pleural effusion. 
 Right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
