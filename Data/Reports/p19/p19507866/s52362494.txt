 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of BOOP, RLL nodule s/p RLL VATS wedge, CT to WS.
 Assess position, rule-out PTX  // ___F with hx of BOOP, RLL nodule s/p RLL VATS
 wedge, CT to WS. Assess position, rule-out PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is status post recent right lower lobe wedge procedure, with chest
 tube in place and a small right apical pneumothorax. Focal opacities in the
 right mid lung adjacent to the operative site are likely due to atelectasis
 and or contusion. Pleural and parenchymal scarring in the periphery of the
 left base related to remote resection are unchanged. However, a patchy opacity
 more centrally in the left retrocardiac region is apparently new since ___ PET-CT and may reflect focal atelectasis or aspiration.
