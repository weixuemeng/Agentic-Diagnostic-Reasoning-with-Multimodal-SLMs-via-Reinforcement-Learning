                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with long history of
 bronchiolitis obliterans, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  Evidence of
 prior surgeries in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe are noted. 
 Minimal interstitial prominence is present, but it is unclear in the absence
 of prior studies for comparison if it demonstrates stability or progression of
 the process.  Correlation with prior imaging is required.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
