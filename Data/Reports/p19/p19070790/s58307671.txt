                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with acute desaturation and concern for flash
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal images of the chest were obtained.  One pair of 
 images demonstrates an NG tube overlying the right chest.  Due to patient
 positioning, it is unclear exactly where this tube is located, particularly
 since there is no lateral view.  The other pair of images demonstrates an NG
 tube with the tip in the stomach.  After discussing with the medical team, it
 appears that this is the latter pair of images.  Again seen is a left lower
 lobe parenchymal density and pleural effusion, unchanged from previous
 imaging.  The right lung is clear.  There is no evidence of flash pulmonary
 edema and, given that the opacity seems localized to the left lower lobe, a
 pneumonic or pleuritic etiology is more likely.  This could include a possible
 infectious etiology in the left lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 cannot be fully assessed due to bordering left lung opacities, but the heart
 appears normal in size.  Gaseous distention of the large and small bowel is
 again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube is seen on the second pair of images to be in
 place with the tip in the stomach.  Left lower lobe opacity and left pleural
 effusion suggestive of a left lower lobe pneumonia or focal process rather
 than a generalized flash pulmonary edema.
 
 These findings were communicated by phone to Dr. ___ at 2:44 p.m.
