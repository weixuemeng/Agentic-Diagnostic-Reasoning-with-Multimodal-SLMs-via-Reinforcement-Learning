                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA  // pls eval for PNA, pleural effusion
 pls eval for PNA, pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to outside chest radiograph dated ___ at
 17:03
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 16:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar linear opacities favor scarring, post inflammatory change, or
 atelectasis especially as the right hemidiaphragm is tented and elevated
 consistent with volume loss.  No developing focal airspace consolidation is
 seen to suggest pneumonia, although outside CT dated ___ does
 demonstrate patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe and a
 more consolidative process in the right posterior medial lower lobe which was
 felt to represent atelectasis, neither of which were well seen on plain
 radiography. There is a right lateral and basilar pleural effusion which is
 unchanged.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
