 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although the configuration of the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter has
 changed, there has been no re-accumulation of pleural effusion, and no
 pneumothorax.  Small extent of right lateral costal pleural thickening or
 minimal residual fluid is unchanged.  Heart is normal size though slightly
 larger today.  Left lung is clear.  Leftward deviation of the cervical trachea
 reflects the adjacent thyroid enlargement.
