                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with productive cough and wheezing. 
 Mild hemoptysis.  Nonsmoker.  Evaluate for possible infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta and
 mediastinal structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There
 exists a small area of poorly delineated parenchymal infiltrates projecting
 partially over the left heart border identified on the lateral view to occupy
 the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.  No other acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free of any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax seen in the
 apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.  Our
 records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Small poorly delineated patchy infiltrate in the left lower lobe posterior
 segment consistent with peribronchial pneumonia.  No other pulmonary
 abnormalities are seen.  Followup after successful treatment is recommended.
