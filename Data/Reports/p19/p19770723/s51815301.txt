                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, recent treatment for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  There is continued patchy opacification within the left lower
 lobe.  No new areas of focal consolidation are seen, and the right lung
 remains clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe patchy opacity remains concerning for pneumonia, not
 significantly changed in the interval.  Followup radiographs 4 weeks after
 treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
