                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, status post chest tube removal, evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 12:19 a.m.
 
 Single portable chest film dated ___ at 9:26 is submitted.  The
 patient's positioning is not noted on the exam and is presumed to most likely
 supine as no air-fluid level is seen within the stomach.  Therefore, this does
 somewhat lower the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the left chest tube with residual patchy opacity at the
 left base which likely represents atelectasis related to the chest tube
 removal.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  Followup imaging in the upright
 position would be advised.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable
 postoperative contours.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in
 the mid-to-distal SVC.  Patchy linear opacity is again seen at the right base
 suggestive of atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
