                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with possible TB  // Eval for pulmonary infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT torso performed at 04:21.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a persistent multi cavitary consolidation in the right upper lobe
 with associated mild volume loss. There has been interval development of
 bilateral heterogeneous consolidations concerning for multi focal pneumonia.
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are better seen on concurrent CT. The
 cardiac silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax. A right chest
 Port-A-Cath terminates at the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right upper lobe cavitary consolidation remains concerning for
 post-primary TB.
 
 2.  Bilateral heterogeneous consolidations are concerning for multi focal
 pneumonia, massive aspiration, or hemorrhage.
 
 3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen to better detail on
 concurrent chest CTA dictated separately.
