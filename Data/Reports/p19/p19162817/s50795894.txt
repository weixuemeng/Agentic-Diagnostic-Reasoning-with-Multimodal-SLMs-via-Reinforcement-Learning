 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion with chest pain radiating to left arm, shoulder
 and back.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Coronary CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Calcifications within the right hilum likely reflect prior granulomatous
 disease.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Tiny calcified granuloma
 is demonstrated within the right mid lung field.  There is minimal linear
 atelectasis in the left lung base.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear atelectasis in the left lung base.  Evidence of prior granulomatous
 disease.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise identified.
