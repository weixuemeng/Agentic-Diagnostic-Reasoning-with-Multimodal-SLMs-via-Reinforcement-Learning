                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with w/ hx renal transplants x2, CAD s/p CABGx4,
 COPD presenting with CHF exacerbation and chest pain, diuresing before further
 cardiac eval and consideration of HD.  // ? worsening pulmonary edema,
 effusion or infectious process    ? worsening pulmonary edema, effusion or
 infectious process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again by basilar
 opacification most likely representing pleural fluid and underlying
 compressive atelectasis that appear much more prominent on the lateral view
 than on the previous examination. However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. The degree of
 pulmonary vascular congestion is probably unchanged.
