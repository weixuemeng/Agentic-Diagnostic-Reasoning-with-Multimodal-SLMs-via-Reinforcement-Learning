 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ESRD, status post renal transplant with cough.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are clear, but
 hyperinflated.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, or
 pulmonary edema.  There is thoracic kyphosis.  Bony changes of renal
 osteodystrophy are again noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs are consistent with COPD.
