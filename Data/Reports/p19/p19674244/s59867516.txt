 removed.  A small left-sided pneumothorax may be present.  Possible small
 bilateral effusions, though not significantly changed.  Upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.  Left-sided line,
 with tip over upper right atrium, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspect small left apical pneumothorax status post removal of
 bilateral chest tubes.
