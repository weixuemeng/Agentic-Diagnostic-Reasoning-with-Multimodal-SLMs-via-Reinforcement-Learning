                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic hypoxic resp failure w/ large
 effusions s/p b/l pigtail placement  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are bibasilar pigtail catheters.  The previously described left
 hydropneumothorax is not well seen, likely due to technique.  There is a
 left-sided central line with the distal lead tip in the distal right atrium,
 unchanged from prior.  Heart size is enlarged but stable.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity. 
 Overall, these findings appear relatively stable.
