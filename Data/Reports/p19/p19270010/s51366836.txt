                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of epigastric pain,
 liver mass, leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the posterior right
 costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural thickening or a trace pleural
 effusion.  The left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying right base
 atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle may
 relate to pleural thickening versus a very trace pleural effusion.
