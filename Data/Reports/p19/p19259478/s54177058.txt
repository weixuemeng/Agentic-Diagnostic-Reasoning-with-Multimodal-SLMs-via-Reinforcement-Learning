                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with large right pleural effusion,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy and bypass surgery
 as well as permanent pacer with dual intravascular electrodes are unchanged. 
 Same holds for the cardiomegaly.  On previous examination noted marked
 perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation has regressed and almost
 normalized, indicating successful dehydration.  The left-sided pleural
 effusion is minimal with mild blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinus.  The large size right-sided pleural effusion is stable and apparently
 unrelated to the patient's now intermittent episode of pulmonary congestion.
