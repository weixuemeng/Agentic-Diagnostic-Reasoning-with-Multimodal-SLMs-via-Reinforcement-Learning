                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  No radiopaque foreign body is identified in the imaged portion of
 the chest or upper abdomen to suggest an ingestion of swallowed dentures. 
 However, only the uppermost portion of the abdomen was included on the study,
 and dedicated abdominal radiograph may be helpful if there is concern for
 foreign body in the large or small bowel.  In the imaged portion of the neck,
 two partially imaged cylindrical radiodense foreign bodies are evident,
 overlying the inferior aspect of the mandible, and may potentially be related
 to dental hardware, cervical spine hardware, or a structure external to the
 patient.  Dedicated neck imaging could clarify the location if it remains
 unknown clinically.
 
 Within the imaged portion of the chest, an asymmetrical 1.6 cm diameter
 opacity is seen at the right apex above the level of the right clavicle
 overlying the fourth posterior rib level.  On the single view, it is uncertain
 whether this is a lung nodule or an abnormality of the rib.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal
 interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right apical nodular opacity which may be related to a rib or lung
 abnormality.  Further evaluation could be performed either with an apical
 lordotic chest radiograph or CT scan, as communicated to Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 8:05 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
 2.  Cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.
 3.  No evidence of ingested foreign body in the thoracic esophagus or stomach.
 Please see comments above regarding the upper cervical region.
