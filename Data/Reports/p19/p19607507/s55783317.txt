                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New lower extremity edema, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There are low lung
 volumes which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No pulmonary
 edema is seen.  There are minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases.  This
 likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion.
