                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of protein-losing enteropathy, tachypnea and wheezing
 with history of thoracic surgery.  Please evaluate for interval change and for
 ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 3.4 cm above the carina. 
 Right-sided central line terminates in the mid SVC.  A right-sided PIC line
 terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 There is an enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the
 body of stomach.  Overall, there has been slight interval increase in
 small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis compared to the prior exam.  There has been an interval decrease
 in the heart size, with interval placement of a pericardial drain. There is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Slight interval increase in small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2. Interval improvement in the size of the heart, with the presence of a
 pericardial drain.
