                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pericardial window with continued cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right PICC line has been
 removed and replaced with a left PICC line that extends to the lower portion
 of the SVC.  The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.  There are
 areas of increased opacification at the bases, most likely reflecting
 atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  There is suggestion of some increased
 widening in the right paratracheal region.  This area should be checked on the
 subsequent radiographs.
 
 Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
