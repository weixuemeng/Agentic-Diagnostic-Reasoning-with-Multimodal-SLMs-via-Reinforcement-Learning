 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube was removed. The
 left basal chest tube as well as the pigtail catheter on the left are still
 visible. Of the chest tube removal, there is a minimal linear hyperlucency
 paralleling the upper aspect 's of the left heart border, potentially
 reflecting a millimetric pleural air collection or the pneumopericardium.  No
 evidence of tension.  No new parenchymal opacities.  No larger pleural
 effusions. Unchanged low lung volumes. No change in position of the right PICC
 line.
