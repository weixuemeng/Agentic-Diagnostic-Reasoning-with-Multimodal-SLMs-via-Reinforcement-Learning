                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable film from earlier the same day and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided venous catheter is seen with an unexpected course
 projecting along the left aspect of the mediastinum to the midline on the
 frontal view and on the lateral view with a posterior course into the
 posterior mediastinum.  The course of this line may in fact be within a venous
 structure involving the superior intercostal vein abutting the aortic knob
 with an inferior trajectory, although correlation with blood gas is suggested
 to exclude an arterial position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lungs are clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:20 p.m. on ___.
