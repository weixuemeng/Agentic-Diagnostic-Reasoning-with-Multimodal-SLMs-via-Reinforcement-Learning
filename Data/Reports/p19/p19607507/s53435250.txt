 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now intubated. The tip
 of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 3.7 cm above the carinal. The
 patient also has received a left chest tube. There is no apparent left
 pneumothorax. On the right, a moderate pleural effusion has developed and a
 right PICC line is in unchanged position as compared to the previous image. A
 previously seen Dobbhoff catheter has been removed in the interval. Moderate
 cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis is present.  Signs of mild fluid
 overload are seen but no overt pulmonary edema is visualized.
