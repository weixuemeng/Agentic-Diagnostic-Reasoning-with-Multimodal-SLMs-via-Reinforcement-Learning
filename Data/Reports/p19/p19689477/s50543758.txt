 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral images of the chest.  A right-sided central line terminates in
 the low SVC.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 prominence, which has progressed over the last several exams.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate to
 severe cardiomegaly is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular prominence, which has progressed over the last
 several exams, raising the possibility of slowly progressive heart failure.
