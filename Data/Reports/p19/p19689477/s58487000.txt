                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with electrolyte abnormality, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size has moderately increased.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is identified; however, a beginning double
 contour within the heart shadow on the frontal view and prominence of the left
 atrial contour posteriorly is suggestive of some increased left atrial
 enlargement.  Appearance of thoracic aorta is unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates a known upper zone redistribution pattern.  Although
 there is no evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses, one can identify mild thickening of the interlobar fissures, all
 consistent with some mild degree of chronic CHF.  Local discrete acute
 parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified and there is no pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderately increased heart size, developing since next preceding
 chest examination eight month ago.  Mild degree of chronic pulmonary
 congestive pattern, but no evidence of pneumonia.
