                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, now with hematemesis,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt
 pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities are more pronounced in the left
 lung base, and likely reflect areas of atelectasis. A small left pleural
 effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, more pronounced on the left, with small left pleural
 effusion. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
