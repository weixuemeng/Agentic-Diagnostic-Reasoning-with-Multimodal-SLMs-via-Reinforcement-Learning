                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright frontal and lateral views of the chest are provided. 
 Underpenetration limits evaluation through the lung bases.  A prominent
 epicardial fat pad accounts for the subtle effacement of the heart borders. 
 There is no lobar consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild
 coarsening of the perihilar bronchovascular markings, which could represent
 mild airways inflammation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No lobar consolidation.  Possible airways inflammation with
 perihilar reticular opacities noted.
