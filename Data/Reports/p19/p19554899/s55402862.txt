                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragms are grossly unchanged from
 comparison study and likely sequelae of COPD.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal contour similar. 
 Prominence of the right hilar contour is compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy as seen on the previous CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 mild degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  .
 2. Hyperinflated lungs compatible with COPD with unchanged right hilar
 lymphadenopathy.
