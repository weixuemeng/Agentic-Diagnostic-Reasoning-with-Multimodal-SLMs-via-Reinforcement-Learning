                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, back pain, history of asthma.  Evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Apparent slight increase in heart size between the two radiographs is
 presumptively technical.  Minimal thickening of the minor fissure on the right
 side is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The
 lungs are grossly clear.  Again, an enlarged epipericardial fat pad is
 preserved.
 
 No acute findings 
 
 CONCLUSION-No acute findings
