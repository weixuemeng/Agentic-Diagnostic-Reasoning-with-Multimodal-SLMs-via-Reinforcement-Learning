                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the low lung volumes and AP
 technique may account for some of the increased prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  There is also evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion and probable small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis.  In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, the possibility of
 supervening pneumonia at one or both bases can certainly not be excluded.
 
 Of incidental note is an old healed fracture of the mid shaft of the right
 clavicle.
