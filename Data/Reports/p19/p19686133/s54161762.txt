                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Fall at home, brought in by ambulance.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 In the AP projection, the heart is probably at the upper limits of normal for
 size.  There does appear to be some pulmonary hyperinflation generally
 increased lung markings are identified.  There is a rounded opacity projected
 over the right breast, probably reflecting a nipple shadow.  A rounded opacity
 projected behind the heart represents a hiatal hernia.  Lateral view shows
 multilevel bony osteopenia and evidence of compression fracture at the lower
 thoracic/thoracolumbar region, likely about the T11 level, which is age
 indeterminant.  The vertebral body below this is also likely slightly wedged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No definitive acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Thoracic compression fracture-age indeterminate
