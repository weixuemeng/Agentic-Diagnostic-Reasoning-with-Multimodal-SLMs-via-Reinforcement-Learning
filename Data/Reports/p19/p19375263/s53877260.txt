                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p throacentesis  // progression of pleural
 effusion      progression of pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___:42 and 15:02.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large scale consolidation has developed in the right lung in both the middle
 and lower lobes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 It would be distinctly unusual for extensive re-expansion edema to present at
 half day following and earlier post thoracentesis radiograph showing
 essentially clear lungs. I discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the alternative
 diagnoses of extensive pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage, for which he says
 there are no current clinical signs or symptoms.
 
 Careful radiographic surveillance is therefore indicated.
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, but there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or
 edema in the left lung, nor is there pneumothorax or any pleural effusion.
