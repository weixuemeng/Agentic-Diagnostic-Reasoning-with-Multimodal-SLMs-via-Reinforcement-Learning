                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx metastatic breast cancer and malignant pleural
 effusions with left chest tube "draining pus."  // worsening effusions?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there is increased opacity projecting over the left hemi thorax. 
 Left chest tube is now in place.  There is no pneumothorax.  Opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung is somewhat improved.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to assess given diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the left lung could be due to loculated
 pleural effusion and underlying parenchymal opacity.
 Slight interval improvement in the appearance of the right lung with decreased
 pleural fluid but persistent parenchymal opacities.
