                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly.  There has been mild improvement in aeration of the
 left lower lung although probably with a small persistent pleural effusion. 
 On the right, several areas of dense opacification appear very similar in
 pattern, probably with a small pleural effusion.  In addition, however, there
 is a more coarse appearance of interstitial change in the right mid to lower
 lung, as well as perhaps increased density associated with perihilar
 opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased coarse interstitial opacification of the right lung mid to lower
 lung, worrisome for lymphangitic carcinomatosis or lymphatic congestion, which
 could result from hilar obstruction.  Increased right hilar opacification. 
 Differential considerations also include superimposed infection.  Otherwise
 the examination is very similar.  Chest CT may be helpful to assess for change
 in more specific detail if clinically indicated.
