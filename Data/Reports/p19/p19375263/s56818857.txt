 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with loculated pleural
 effusion status post pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a pigtail catheter
 projecting over the left lung base.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  The left hemidiaphragm is better visualized on today's exam,
 suggestive of resolution of left pleural fluid.  Patchy opacities and pleural
 effusion on the right are unchanged.  Gaseous distention of bowel loops is
 noted in the left upper quadrant of the visualized abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolution of the left pleural effusion.  Unchanged patchy opacities and
 loculated pleural effusion on the right.
