                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with productive cough.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate consolidation of
 the right upper lung, consistent with infection.  There is apparent associated
 perihilar prominence suggestive of reactive lymphadenopathy.  The cardiac
 silhouette is prominent, accentuated by low lung volumes.  The thoracic aorta
 is slightly unfolded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Trace
 subsegmental atelectasis may be present at the left base.  The left lung is
 otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with the right upper lobe pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution once treated with full course of antibiotics.
