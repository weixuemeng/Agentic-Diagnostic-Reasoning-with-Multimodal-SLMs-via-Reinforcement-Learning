                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Previously seen right
 upper and lower zone opacities mostly resolved, however trace opacities remain
 in these regions.  No new opacities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved right lung pneumonia.  Residual opacities at the right
 lung likely reflect some residual disease.  A followup at four weeks is
 recommended to ensure resolution.
