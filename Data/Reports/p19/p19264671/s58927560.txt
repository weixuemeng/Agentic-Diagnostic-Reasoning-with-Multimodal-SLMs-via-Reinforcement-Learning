                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with abnormal chest
 radiograph, followup.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance.  There is an
 opacity projecting over the right lower lung, improved since the prior study
 but not back to the baseline yet, most likely representing residual of prior
 infection.  The assessment of the patient in four weeks for documentation of
 complete resolution of the process is recommended.
