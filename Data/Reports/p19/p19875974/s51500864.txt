                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure, resolved aortic
 dissection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The tip of endotracheal tube ends approximately 8.4 cm above the carina at the
 level of the clavicles.  Consider advancing the ET tube by additional 2-2.5 cm
 for better seating.  Gastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach
 and is appropriately positioned.  An aortic stent graft is present extending
 from the level of the aortic arch till the mid descending thoracic aorta. 
 Remarkable for engorged pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haziness
 suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The heart size is normal. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
