 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid
 superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Other indwelling devices
 remain in standard position.  Appearance of aortic stent graft and adjacent
 aortic contour are unchanged.  Heart size remains normal.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is again demonstrated, as well as a left-sided predominant hazy and
 reticular pattern, likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Moderate
 layering left pleural effusion is apparently new since the prior chest
 radiograph, but is evident on more recent CT exam of ___.
