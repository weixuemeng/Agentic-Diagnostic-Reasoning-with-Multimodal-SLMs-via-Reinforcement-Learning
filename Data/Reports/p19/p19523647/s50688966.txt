                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea. Evaluate for infiltrate or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, including the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions and associated
 basilar opacities, larger on the left than the right. These opacities may
 represent compressive atelectasis, though a component of infection is
 difficult to completely exclude. Additionally, there is mild vascular
 congestion. No pneumothorax is identified. The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged, and normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the
 aortic arch. The heart is moderately enlarged. It appears slightly increased
 in size since the prior exam.  Otherwise, there has been little change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Bibasilar consolidations, larger on the left from the right, which may
 represent compressive atelectasis, though a component of infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
 3. Mild vascular congestion.
 4. Cardiomegaly.
