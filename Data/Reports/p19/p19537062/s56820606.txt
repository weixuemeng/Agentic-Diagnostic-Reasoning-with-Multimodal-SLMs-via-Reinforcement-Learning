                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Projecting over
 the lateral left mid lung is a small nodular focus of high density consistent
 with a calcification, measuring about 5 mm in diameter, consistent with either
 a parenchymal granuloma or perhaps a bone island within the anterior left
 fifth rib.  Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
