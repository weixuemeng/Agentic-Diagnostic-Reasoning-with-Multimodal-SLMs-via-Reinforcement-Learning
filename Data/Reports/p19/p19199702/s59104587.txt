                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement, evaluate for effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper to mid superior vena
 cava.
 
 There has been near resolution of the right pleural effusion, now tiny.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  A rounded area of consolidation is seen inferiorly, only
 on the lateral view, and was not appreciated on the pre-operative study.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged but improved.  Postoperative
 mediastinal widening is resolving.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Rounded inferior lung opacity, only seen on the lateral view, could
 represent post-operative rounded atelectasis.  Attention on follow up is
 recommended if the patient does not have fever.
 2. Near resolution of right pleural effusion, now tiny.
