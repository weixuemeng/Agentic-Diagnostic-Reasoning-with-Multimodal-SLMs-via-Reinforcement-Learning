  Lungs are low in volume with left greater than right basal opacities which
  could reflect infectious process and small to moderate left effusion. There is
  the suggestion of two rounded potentially cavitating or centrally lucent
  lesions in the right lung base and left midlung which given the history could
  reflect septic emboli. Consider CT of the chest to better assess.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with endocarditis with new
 line placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size appears to be
 enlarged, which is in part exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Bibasal
 atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion noted.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Infectious process in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
