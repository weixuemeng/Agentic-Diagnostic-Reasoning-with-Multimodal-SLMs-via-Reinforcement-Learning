                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and aortic
 valve replacement.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance in the
 post-operative period.  Slight improvement in degree of left lower lobe
 atelectasis but unchanged small left pleural effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at
 right lung base and small right pleural effusion are also similar to the prior
 study.  No visible pneumothorax.  On the lateral radiograph, an apparent small
 air-fluid level is present in the upper retrosternal region.  This cannot be
 compared to prior studies due to absence of a lateral view on previous exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis and persistent small pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.
 
 2.  Apparent small retrosternal air-fluid level on lateral view, which could
 reflect post-operative changes in the anterior mediastinum or a small
 loculated hydropneumothorax.
