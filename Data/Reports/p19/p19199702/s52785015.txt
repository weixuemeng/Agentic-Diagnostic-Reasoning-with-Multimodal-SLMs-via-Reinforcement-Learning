                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 728
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mechanical AVR and fungal infection,
 evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 8 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film of ___ at 728 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy with overall stably enlarged heart, which
 most likely reflects cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be
 excluded.  There has been some interval improvement but certainly residual
 bilateral predominantly interstitial process which likely reflects improving
 interstitial edema.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
