                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chills and white blood cell count of 24.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate left lower lobe opacity, which
 projects over spine on the lateral view.  Given the recurrence of this opacity
 and the similar location over last several months, it may be explained by
 aspiration or scarring.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are present, otherwise hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  Osseous structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity has been present on multiple prior examinations over
 last several months, and may be due to recurrent episodes of aspiration or
 scarring.  Imaging and clinical evaluation of lung abnormalities should be
 continued on an out patient basis.
