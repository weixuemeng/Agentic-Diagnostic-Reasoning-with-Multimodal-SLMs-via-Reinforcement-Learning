 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is unchanged severe technical limitation of the image. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists and the lung bases are better ventilated than
 on the previous image.  However, the presence of a subtle right basal or left
 basal pneumonia can still not be excluded.  No pneumothorax.
