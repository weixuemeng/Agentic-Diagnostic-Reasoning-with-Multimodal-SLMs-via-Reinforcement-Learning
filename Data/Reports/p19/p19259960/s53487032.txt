                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Calcified
 pleural plaque is noted, which may account for the scattered opacities within
 both lungs.  The lung volumes are low, which limits the assessment.  Given the
 rounded appearance of a lesion projecting over the right mid-to-upper lung, a
 CT is needed to ensure the aforementioned lesions represent pleural calcified
 plaque.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding
 without discrete evidence for pneumonia or overt CHF.  No large effusions or
 pneumothorax seen.  Midline sternotomy wires are noted.  There is a prosthetic
 cardiac valve.  The heart size and mediastinal contour appear within normal
 limits.  No acute bony injuries.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Scattered calcified pleural plaque, likely accounts for the
 rounded and vague opacities projecting over both lungs.  Recommend CT to
 confirm, on a non-emergent basis.
