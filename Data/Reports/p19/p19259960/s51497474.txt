  Decreased prominence of the mediastinal structures is consistent with change
  in technique.Small right pleural effusion. Left basilar atelectasis with
  likely small pleural effusion, stable. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
  appears slightly more pronounced on the current study, which may be due to
  volume loss at the left base. No new consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG/AVR  // eval postop changes     
 eval postop changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly better lung
 volumes. Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with some
 combination of volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle process. Subparagraph extensive calcifications
 are again seen bilaterally, suggesting asbestos disease.  No evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
