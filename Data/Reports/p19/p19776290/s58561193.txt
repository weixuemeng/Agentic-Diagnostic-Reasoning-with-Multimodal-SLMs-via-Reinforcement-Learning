                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___, 11:58 A.M.  
 
 HISTORY:  High spiking fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Extensive consolidation has developed in a perihilar distribution, right
 greater than left.  Interval increase in cardiac size is probably a function
 of difference in radiographic technique, but there has been an increase in
 caliber of mediastinal veins suggesting a component of volume overload or mild
 cardiac dysfunction.  Overall, the findings suggest progressive pneumonia with
 secondary cardiovascular effect.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  Central
 adenopathy is not really assessed by this examination.
