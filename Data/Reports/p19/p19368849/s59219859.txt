 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, but not significantly changed

 contours are otherwise normal.  There is minimal right lower lobe atelectasis.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  Marked tracheomalacia is redemonstrated. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Deformity of the left
 clavicle relates to remote trauma.
