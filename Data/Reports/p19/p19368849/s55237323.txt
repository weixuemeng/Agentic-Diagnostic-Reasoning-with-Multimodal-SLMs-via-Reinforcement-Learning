 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with heart failure,
 pneumonia, and acute hypoxemia.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 There is potential interval increase in cardiac silhouette, thus correlation
 with echocardiography to exclude pericardial effusion is recommended.  There
 is progression of the left perihilar and right lower lobe as well as left
 lower lobe consolidations concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  No definitive
 evidence of edema is present.  There is no evidence of substantial pleural
 effusion, although small amount of pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
