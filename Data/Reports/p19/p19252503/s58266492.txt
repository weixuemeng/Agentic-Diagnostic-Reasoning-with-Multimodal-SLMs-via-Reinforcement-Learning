                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M palpitations and chest pressure, without pain, without
 shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures is present due to low lung volumes without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
