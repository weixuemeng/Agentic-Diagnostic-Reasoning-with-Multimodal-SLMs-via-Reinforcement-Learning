                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate minimal right basilar
 atelectasis and a probable small right pleural effusion.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The upper mediastinal contours
 are widened secondary to an unfolded configuration to the thoracic aorta. 
 Kyphosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal right basilar atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  Underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 2.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
