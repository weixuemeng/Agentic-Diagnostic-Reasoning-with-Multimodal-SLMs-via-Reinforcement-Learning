                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are seen which likely represent combination of pleural
 effusions and atelectasis although consolidation due to infection or
 aspiration is not excluded.  Superior vena cava stent is re- demonstrated. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable and
 unremarkable.  A square radiopaque structure projects over the right upper
 hemi thorax, also present on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis and small pleural effusions
 although consolidations due to infection or aspiration not excluded.
