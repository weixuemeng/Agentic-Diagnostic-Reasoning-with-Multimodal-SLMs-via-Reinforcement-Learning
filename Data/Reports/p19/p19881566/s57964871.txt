 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:00 PM
  
  1. No central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.
  2. Possible trace left pleural effusion.  No large effusion on the right.
  3. Stable diffuse interstitial opacities, suggestive of chronic interstitial
  process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sick sinus syndrome status post PPM, mitral
 regurgitation presents with chest heaviness  // evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are well inflated.  A left-sided pacing device with dual leads
 follow the expected course to the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may be due to a small pleural effusion or chronic pleural thickening. 
 No large effusion on the right.  There is no central vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  Diffuse interstitial opacification extending to the
 periphery bilaterally is unchanged since prior study and likely reflects a
 chronic interstitial process.  There is stable mild parenchymal scarring at
 the right lung base.  Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is re-
 demonstrated with atherosclerotic calcifications.  Otherwise, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Heart size normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pulmonary edema.
 2. Possible trace left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  No large
 effusion on the right.
 3. Similar mild diffuse interstitial opacities, suggestive of a chronic
 interstitial process.
