                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pain after
 colonoscopy, rule out free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Through the position of the bowel, lucency under the left hemidiaphragm could
 relate to colon and stomach, although it is difficult to exclude free air on
 this study.  Recommend supine and upright views of the abdomen for further
 evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs.
 2.  Due to position of the bowel/stomach, lucency under the left hemidiaphragm
 is difficult to exclude free air.  Recommend supine and upright views of the
 abdomen for further evaluation.
