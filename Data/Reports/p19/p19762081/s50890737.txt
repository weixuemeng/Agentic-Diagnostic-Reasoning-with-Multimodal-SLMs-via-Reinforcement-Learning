                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of external compression/tracheal
 stenosis s/p stent, with hypoxia and new leukocytosis.  // Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is again seen a large multinodular thyroid goiter which is better
 assessed on the prior chest CT.  This causes prominence of the upper
 mediastinum.  Cardiac border is within normal limits.  There is mild
 hyperinflation.  There is likely a small left-sided pleural effusion and there
 is some atelectasis versus early infiltrate at the left retrocardiac region.
 There are no pneumothoraces.
