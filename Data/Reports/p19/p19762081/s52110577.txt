  2. Hyperexpansion consistent with COPD.
  3. Upper mediastinal widening for which contrast-enhanced chest CT is again
  recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with likely new CHF, evaluate for volume overload or
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate hyperexpansion suggesting underlying COPD.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities most likely represent atelectasis given the rapid
 progression compared with the recent prior study.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pneumothorax.  Widening of the upper mediastinum is
 unchanged from recent prior chest radiographs and chest CT is again
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar airspace opacities most likely represent atelectasis.
 2. Hyperexpansion consistent with COPD.
 3. Upper mediastinal widening for which contrast-enhanced chest CT is again
 recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent chest CT with contrast is recommended to
 evaluate the upper mediastinum.
