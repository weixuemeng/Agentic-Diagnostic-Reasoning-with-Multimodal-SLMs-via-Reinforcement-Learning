                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o COPD not on home O2 prior to admission, patient originally
 admitted at ___ from ___ for dyspnea and found to have a PNA along
 with 6.3 x 5.9 x 5.5 cm left thyroid mass (later found on pathology to be
 multinodular goiter) that was felt to be compressing her airway s/p
 hemi-thyroidectomy and trache placement now transferred to the floor for
 further management.  // trach placement  trach placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is mediastinal
 widening in the cervical thoracic region.  Continued increased opacification
 at the left base.  This could represent merely pleural fluid and atelectasis,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia could be
 considered.
 Mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
