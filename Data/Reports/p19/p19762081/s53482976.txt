 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent right basilar opacity due to underlying effusion with atelectasis. 
 More faint right basilar opacity likely due to combination of effusion and
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, lungs are clear.  Prominence of the upper
 mediastinum in the region of the thoracic inlet is again noted.  Endotracheal
 tube tip is now 3.4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the field
 of view, side-port potentially in the region of the gastroesophageal junction.

 ET tube tip 3.4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube side port in the region of
 the GE junction and could be advanced for more optimal positioning. 
 Otherwise, no change.
