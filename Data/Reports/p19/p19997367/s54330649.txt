                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve repair. Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium.
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads in the
 right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is normal. Aortic knob
 calcifications are re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Small right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally
 and medially appears relatively unchanged as is a small left pleural effusion.
 Lungs remain hyperinflated with streaky opacities in the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax
 is identified, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The patient is
 status post left mastectomy and breast implant. Cholecystectomy clips are
 noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively unchanged appearance of small bilateral pleural effusions, with the
 right pleural effusion appearing partially loculated. Patchy opacities in lung
 bases are nonspecific and may reflect atelectasis or infection.
