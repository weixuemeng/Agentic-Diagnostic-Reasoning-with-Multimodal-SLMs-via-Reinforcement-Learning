 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent right effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right
 pleural effusion has mildly decreased.  However, the effusion is still clearly
 visible.  On the left, a probably partly loculated pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  No changes in appearance of the lung parenchyma.  The cardiac
 silhouette is constant in appearance.  Unchanged right Port-A-Cath, left
 pectoral pacemaker.
