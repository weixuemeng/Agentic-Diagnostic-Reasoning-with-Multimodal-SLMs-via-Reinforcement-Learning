                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a
 thoracentesis on the left with removal of a substantial pleural fluid.  No
 definite pneumothorax.  Residual opacification at the left most likely
 represents a combination of pleural fluid, volume loss, and re-expansion
 edema.
 
 Remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
