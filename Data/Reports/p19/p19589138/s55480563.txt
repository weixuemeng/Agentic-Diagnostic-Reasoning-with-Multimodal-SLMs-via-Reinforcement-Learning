                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, rule out congestive
 cardiac failure or rib fracture or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from the prior
 examination. Mild low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  No rib fractures are visualized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings and bibasilar
 opacification increased on the right, most likely representing atelectasis;
 however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.
 2. No rib fractures. If rib fractures are clinically suspected then a
 dedicated rib series can be obtained.
