                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complaining of chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Faint opacities in the lung bases are likely due to atelectasis.  There are no
 other focal airspace opacities to suggest infection.  The lungs are well
 expanded.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal as on the previous
 study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis without evidence to suggest pneumonia.
