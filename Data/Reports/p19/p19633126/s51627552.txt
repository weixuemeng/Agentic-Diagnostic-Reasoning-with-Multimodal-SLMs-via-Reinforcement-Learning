                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 aortic arch is calcified.  The pulmonary interstitium appears irregular and
 there is a patchy peripheral opacification suggesting a substantial
 interstitial abnormality.  Although lung volumes are low, there may be an
 emphysematous component noting relative lucency and attenuation of
 bronchovascular structures in the upper lung.  Associated with slight
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is predominantly streaky focal
 opacification in the left lower lobe, which may be due to chronic scarring or
 atelectasis, although an infectious cause is hard to completely exclude. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The bones appear demineralized.
 There are mild degenerative changes along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting interstitial lung disease and perhaps coinciding
 emphysema.
 
 2.  Focal opacity in the left lower lung, not specific although compatible
 with atelectasis.
 
 Particularly if pulmonary symptoms are chronic and of uncertain etiology, a
 chest CT may be considered depending on clinical evaluation, particularly if
 the cause of lung disease depicted on the radiographs is unknown and prior
 imaging is not available.
