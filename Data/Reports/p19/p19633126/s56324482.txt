                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:17 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with coronary artery disease, chest pain and
 rigors.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are very low, perhaps in part to severe gaseous distention of the
 stomach and intestinal tract in the upper abdomen, but there is new mild
 pulmonary edema and progressive dilatation of mediastinal and pulmonary
 vasculature accompanied by likely small right pleural effusion.  I doubt focal
 pneumonia is present.
