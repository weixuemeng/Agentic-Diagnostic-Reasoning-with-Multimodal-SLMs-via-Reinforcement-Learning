                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with right femur fracture.  Preoperative study.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The main pulmonary
 artery contour appears moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified. 
 Opacities at the lung bases have markedly improved, leaving streaky opacities,
 most prominent at the left retrocardiac region.  There is increased
 interstitial abnormality suggesting mild vascular congestion.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature
 centered along the lower thoracic spine with multilevel mild degenerative
 changes noted along the lower thoracic levels.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, although somewhat increased.
 
 2.  Marked improvement in basilar opacities with residual streaky opacities,
 greater on the left than right, suggestive of atelectasis or resolving
 infection.
