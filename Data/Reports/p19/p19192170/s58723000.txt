                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with generalized weakness and increased leg
 swelling and history of CHF.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is pulmonary vascular congestion with indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings seen throughout.  Bibasilar opacities are seen, progressed
 on the right when compared to prior and new streaky left basilar opacities as
 well.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, also new from prior. 
 Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess as it is silhouetted particularly on
 the right, but is at least mildly enlarged, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Right greater than left basilar opacities which could represent
 superimposed infection.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document
 resolution especially in setting of previously seen right-sided consolidation
 without documented resolution in the interim.
