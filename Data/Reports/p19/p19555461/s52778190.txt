                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increased frequency of seizures, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacities at
 the left lung base laterally in the retrocardiac region are identified,
 potentially due to atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Mid thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities at the left lung base suggestive of atelectasis;
 however, if high clinical suspicion for infection, two-view chest may offer
 additional detail.
