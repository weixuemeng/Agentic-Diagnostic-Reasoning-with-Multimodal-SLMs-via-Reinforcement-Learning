                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD and AMS, intubated  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier on same day on ___ at 04:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with chest radiograph performed earlier on same day, there has been
 interval placement of the ET tube, which terminates 5 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube is difficult to follow throughout the entire chest, but
 terminates below the level of the diaphragm in the stomach.  There is left
 basilar atelectasis.  Left perihilar and right basilar opacities are increased
 from prior and likely represent asymmetric edema or aspiration. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube is appropriately positioned, terminating approximately 5 cm above
 the carina.
 2. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach.
 3. Interval increase in left perihilar and right basilar opacities likely
 representing asymmetric edema or aspiration.
