                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with respiratory failure, intubated // eval ET tube
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.6 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is noted within the distal esophagus, though the tip is not well
 visualized.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta
 is tortuous.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  Numerous clips are seen in the right neck.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 2. Enteric tube courses into the distal esophagus, however the tip is not well
 visualized on this exam.  Dedicated radiographs of the upper abdomen are
 recommended to better assess the location of the tip of the enteric tube.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 4. Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
