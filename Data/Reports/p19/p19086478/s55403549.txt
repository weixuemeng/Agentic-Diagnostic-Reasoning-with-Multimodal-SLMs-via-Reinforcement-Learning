                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal structures are remarkable for
 air-filled distention of the upper thoracic esophagus lateral to the trachea. 
 Within the lungs, coarse bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities are present
 with mildly dilated bronchi.  Although these findings are present on the prior
 study, newly developed patchy opacities have developed in both lung bases with
 associated partial obscuration of both hemidiaphragms.  Bi-apical pleural and
 parenchymal scarring appears unchanged.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New patchy bibasilar lung opacities which may reflect recurrent aspiration
 pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity.
 2.  These findings are superimposed on bibasilar interstitial lung disease,
 which could be due to a variety of etiologies including chronic aspiration,
 IPF and NSIP.  If warranted clinically, dedicated chest CT with
 high-resolution technique may be considered following resolution of the acute
 basilar opacity.
