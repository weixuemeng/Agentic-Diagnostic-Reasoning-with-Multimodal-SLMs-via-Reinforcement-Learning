                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC, COPD, recent plugs in bronchi  //
 change in XR      change in XR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change.
 Again there are diffuse coarse opacifications bilaterally with evidence of
 previous left upper lobe resection and displacement of the trachea to the
 left.  PICC line remains in good position.
 There is the vague suggestion of more coalescent opacification at the left
 base.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of developing
 consolidation could be considered.
