  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.6 cm above the carina, withdrawal
  is recommended. Lung volumes are decreased. There is bibasilar atelectasis.
  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is also likely secondary to small
  amount of pleural effusion. Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe
  is slightly improved, however previously described differential remains,
  including aspiration, pneumonia or procedure related hemoptysis. Findings
  regarding ETT discussed with Dr ___ ___ telephone on ___ at
  17:20, ___ min after discovery. NSR

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, s/p phototherapy with
 respiratory arrest.  // evaluate tube placement, lung parenchyma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.6 cm above the carina, withdrawal
 is recommended. Lung volumes are decreased, and there is interval development
 of right basal atelectasis. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is also likely secondary to small amount of pleural
 effusion. Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe is slightly
 improved, however previously described differential remains, including
 aspiration, pneumonia or procedure related hemoptysis.
