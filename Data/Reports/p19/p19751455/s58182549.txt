                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with congestion and right lower lung crackles on
 exam; evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant change compared to the prior radiograph exam. Stable appearance
 of the bilateral increased interstitial markings that are more prominent in
 the lower lungs. The left upper lung nodule is not as clearly demonstrated
 today due to overlapping of the ribs, but appears unchanged and is better
 demonstrated on the CT on ___.  Stable post-surgical changes
 consistent with prior left upper lung resection, including left apical pleural
 scarring, upward retraction of the left hilus, reduced left lung volume, and
 slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Stable hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with slight flattening of the diaphragms.
 
 No discrete focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Stable
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila. Stable slightly
 tortuous descending aorta.
 
 No acute osseous abnormality. No sub-diaphragmatic intra-abdominal free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process, including no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
 
 2. Stable chronic lung changes and post-surgical changes as above.
