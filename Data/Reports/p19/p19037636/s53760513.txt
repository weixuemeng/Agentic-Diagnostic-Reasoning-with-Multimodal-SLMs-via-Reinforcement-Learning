 approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the
 distal esophagus.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Status post endotracheal
 intubation.  If clinically indicated, the orogastric tube could be advanced
 into the stomach and the endotracheal tube also advanced slightly.
