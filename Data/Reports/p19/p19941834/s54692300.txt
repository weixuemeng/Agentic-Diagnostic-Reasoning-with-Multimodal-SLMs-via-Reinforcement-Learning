                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers for one day.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As on prior, low lung volumes are seen.  There has, however, been
 interval clearance of the retrocardiac opacity seen on the previous lateral
 view. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and likely within normal
 limits given positioning and low lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam given low lung volumes; however, no evidence of
 large confluent consolidation.
