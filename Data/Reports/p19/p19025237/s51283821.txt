                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p liver
 transplant on immunosuppression with newly developed fevers.  // Please
 evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of chest CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a hazy opacity in the right mid zone likely corresponding in the
 lower portion of the right upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia.  Otherwise,
 the right and left lungs are grossly clear, without CHF, other focal opacity,
 or fusion.  The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively large hazy opacity in the right mid zone consistent with pneumonia,
 likely in the lower portion of the right upper lobe.  The differential could
 include other etiologies for an alveolar opacity, but, given the history of
 fevers, these are considered less likely.  This finding is new compared with
 the chest CT from ___.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.
