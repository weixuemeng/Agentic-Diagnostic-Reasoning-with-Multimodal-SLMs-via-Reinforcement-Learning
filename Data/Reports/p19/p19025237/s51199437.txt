                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.5 cm above the level of
 the carina.  There are low lung volumes.  Patchy right upper lobe opacity
 could relate to low lung volumes and artifact, although an underlying
 consolidation can be present.  No additional consolidation is seen.  The right
 costophrenic angle is not included on the image.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely
 accentuated by supine, AP technique.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Gaseous
 distention of the colon is incidentally noted.
