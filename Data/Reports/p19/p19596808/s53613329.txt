 HISTORY:  Postop fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased heterogeneous opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower
 lung and left lower lung in conjunction with vascular engorgement likely
 represents asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, a diffuse viral
 bronchopneumonia could have a similar appearance.  No change in numerous
 pleural plaques and scarring of the right middle lobe. Normal heart size with
 stable aortic tortuosity.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Heterogeneous opacities in right mid and lower lung and left lower lung likely
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, diffuse viral bronchopneumonia
 could have a similar appearance.
