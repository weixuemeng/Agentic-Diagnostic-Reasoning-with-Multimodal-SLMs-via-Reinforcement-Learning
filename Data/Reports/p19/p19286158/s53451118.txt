                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post chole, now generalized
 edema and pulmonary congestion. Study requested for evaluation of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval removal of an upper enteric drainage tube.  A right IJ venous
 catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Left lower lobe is
 densely consolidated, likely due to atelectasis and increased small pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged and
 moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 right shoulder.
