                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:52 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new nasogastric tube after upper abdominal
 surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Upper enteric drainage tube has been withdrawn into the chest.  Either the
 patient has had a gastric pull-up or the esophagus is distended.  There is no
 dilated stomach in the abdomen.  A second drainage catheter, presumably
 percutaneous, crosses the midline at the level of the liver edge.  Left lower
 lobe is densely consolidated, presumably atelectasis.  Upper bowel loops which
 previously projected over the cardiac silhouette are now opacified, presumably
 full of fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion is
 likely.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Both shoulders are severely degenerated.
