                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Slight crackles at the bases, admitted for
 cholecystitis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Large hernia in the left hemithorax is noted versus
 substantially elevated left hemidiaphragm that might explain abnormality in
 the breath sounds at this location.  Right lung is essentially clear.  There
 is no appreciable pulmonary edema.  No appreciable pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Substantial degenerative changes are
 noted in both shoulders.
