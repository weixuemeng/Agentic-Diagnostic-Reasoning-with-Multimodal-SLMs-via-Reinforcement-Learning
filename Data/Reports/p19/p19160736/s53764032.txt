                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral upright radiographs through the chest demonstrate no focal
 opacity convincing for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Osseous
 structures demonstrate no acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. If clinically focal findings are
 present to suggest chest cage abnormality, dedicated rib films could be
 obtained for further evaluation as conventional radiographs are insensitive
 for chest cage trauma.
