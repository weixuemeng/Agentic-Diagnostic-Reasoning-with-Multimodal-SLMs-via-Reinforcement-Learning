                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with tachypnea and hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia and CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left internal jugular venous catheter line has been removed in the
 interim.  A left subclavian approach PICC tip has been retracted in the
 interim and now projects over expected region of the cavoatrial junction. 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  Linear bandlike opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung is probably platelike atelectasis and/or
 scarring, seen on the prior exam and unchanged.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left PICC tip now projects over the expected region of the distal
 cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Lung volumes are low with atelectasis but no frank pulmonary edema or
 focal pneumonia.  If concern for pneumonia persists recommend returning for
 conventional PA and lateral radiograph views with better inspiration.
