                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with past medical history significant for CHF,
 a. fib, CAD, DM2, amyloid angyopathy, multiple previous intra-parenchymal /
 subdural/arachnoid bleeds, chronic multidrug resistant UTI, and baseline
 aphasia/bed-ridden presenting with hypoxia from SNF.  // Etiology of worsened
 hypoxia: ? aspiration, ? volume overload, etc
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 09:29, ___, ___.
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left PICC terminates in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  Prominent lobulated hilar contours bilaterally secondary
 to dilated pulmonary arteries and a large right pulmonary vein better
 evaluated on chest CT from ___.  Linear opacity at the right mid
 lung likely represents platelike atelectasis, unchanged from prior study. 
 Left basilar atelectasis is noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be
 present.  There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral pleural effusions in the setting of very low lung volumes.
 2. Prominent hilar contours attributable to enlarged right and left pulmonary
 arteries and large right pulmonary vein better evaluated on chest CT from ___.
