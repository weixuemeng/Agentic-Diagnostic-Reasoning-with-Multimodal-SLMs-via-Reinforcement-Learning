                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/left IJ placement, please confirm placement  // ___M w/left
 IJ placement, please confirm placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the most recent prior, a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter has been placed.  The catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Again
 noted are low lung volumes.  No new focal consolidation is identified.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Again seen is a possible diffusion on the right,
 unchanged since the prior examination.  The cardiac silhouette is borderline
 enlarged and the pulmonary vascularity is indistinct, which may be suggestive
 of mild edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC.  Otherwise no
 significant interval change.
