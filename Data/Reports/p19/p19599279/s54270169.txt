                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent discharge for PNA with AMS  // eval ?
 recurrent PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes have decreased and
 remain low.  Linear opacity at the right lung base likely represents chronic
 atelectasis or fissural thickening.  Possible effusion on the right, likely
 moderate.  There are no new focal consolidations.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderately cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion suggests mild heart
 failure.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Low lung volumes.  Probable moderate right effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly
 with pulmonary vascular congestion suggests mild heart failure.
 3. Right basilar linear opacity likely represents chronic atelectasis or
 fissural thickening.
