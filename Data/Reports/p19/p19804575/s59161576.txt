                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary fibrosis, now with dyspnea, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited by technique.  Within this
 limitation, the inspiratory lung volumes remain low.  The coarse reticular
 markings in the lung parenchyma are increased from the prior study, more
 pronounced in the lung bases.  In particular, there is decreased aeration of
 the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or developing airspace
 disease.  The pulmonary vasculature is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Partial calcification of the aortic
 knob is re-demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacification of the right lung base may reflect atelectasis or
 developing airspace disease.  Recommend clinical correlation.
 2.  Increased interstitial opacities suggest chronic background fibrotic
 changes of the lungs with superimposed pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
