 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary fibrosis, congestive heart failure, increasing
 shortness of breath, evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the fibrotic changes of the
 lung parenchyma has moderately increased.  In addition, there is a minimal
 prominence of the vascular structures.  Given the increased size of the
 cardiac silhouette, a combination of progressive fibrosis and mild fluid
 overload is likely.  However, neither the frontal nor the lateral radiographs
 show evidence of pleural effusion.
 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
