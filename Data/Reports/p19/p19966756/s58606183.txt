                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cougfh, sob, hypoxia  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 overlying atelectasis.  Right middle lobe opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis rather than consolidation due to pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 given differences in lung volume and technique..  Prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature is likely accentuated by a low lung volumes and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying right middle lobe
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not entirely excluded.
