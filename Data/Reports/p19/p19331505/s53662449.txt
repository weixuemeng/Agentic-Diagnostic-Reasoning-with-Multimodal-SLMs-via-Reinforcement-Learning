                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  There is a large hiatal hernia
 with an air-fluid level.  Streaky associated opacities in both lung bases
 suggest associated atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are stable
 along the visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia with associated parenchymal opacity, probably
 associated atelectasis; otherwise unremarkable.
