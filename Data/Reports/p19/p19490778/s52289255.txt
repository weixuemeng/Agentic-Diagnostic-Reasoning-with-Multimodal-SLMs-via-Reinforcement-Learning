 HISTORY:  Chest pain.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Elevation left hemidiaphragm is stable.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Elevated left hemidiaphragm with adjacent retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflecting atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
