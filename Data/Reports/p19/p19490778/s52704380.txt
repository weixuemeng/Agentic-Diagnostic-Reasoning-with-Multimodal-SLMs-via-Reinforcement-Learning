                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG with decreased breath sounds at the left base. 
 Assess for effusion or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs were acquired of the chest.  As
 before, the patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is increased compared to the prior study from ___.  Streaky left lower lung opacities are likely atelectases, although
 could be aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  There
 are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size
 is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are multilevel flowing
 anterior osteophytes, suggestive of DISH.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, likely partially
 accounting for the decreased breath sounds on physical exam.  Adjacent left
 lower lobe opacities could be atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
