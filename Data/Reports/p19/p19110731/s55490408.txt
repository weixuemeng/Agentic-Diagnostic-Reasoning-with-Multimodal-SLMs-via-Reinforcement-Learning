                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph obtained on ___, at an outside
 hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is technically limited.  The lung volumes are very low. 
 There is mild obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, which could be due
 to atelectasis, although a developing consolidation cannot be excluded.  There
 is mild lucency overlying the upper hemidiaphragms.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.  The
 heart size is difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes, although may
 be mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Very technically limited exam.  Obscuration of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms  is likely related to atelectasis and low lung volumes,
 although developing consolidation cannot be completely excluded. 
 2.  Lucency overlying the hemidiaphragms, which is likely due to positioning,
 although cannot pneumoperitoneum cannot be completely excluded.  Recommend
 repeat upright radiographs, possibly with a lateral view, if clinically
 indicated. 
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8 AM on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___.
