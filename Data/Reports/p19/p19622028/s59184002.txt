                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, likely STEMI  // eval for acute changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest tear
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower than on prior exam and there are uniformly distributed
 bilateral reticular opacities, suggestive of possible pulmonary fibrotic
 changes although cannot exclude a superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema.
 Bibasilar opacities are seen, which may represent atelectasis but cannot
 exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  There is a new
 left retrocardiac opacity. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There
 is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Lower lung volumes and uniformly distributed bilateral reticular
 opacities, suggestive of possible pulmonary fibrotic changes although cannot
 exclude a superimposed interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude
 pneumonia or aspiration in the clinical setting.
