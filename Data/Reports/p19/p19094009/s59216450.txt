 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased oxygen requirements, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Multiple calcified pleural plaques, likely related to previous
 asbestos exposure.  Minimal scarring at the right lung bases.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
