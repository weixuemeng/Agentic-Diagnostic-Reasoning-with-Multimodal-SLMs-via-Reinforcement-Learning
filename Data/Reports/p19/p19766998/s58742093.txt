                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with COPD and ascites, presenting with worsening
 shortness of breath, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Lung volumes are
 low. Heart is normal in size and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. 
 Bibasilar linear opacities likely represent atelectasis; however, developing
 consolidation at the right base is not excluded.  A small right pleural
 effusion is noted on the lateral view.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Developing consolidation at
 the right base, not excluded.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
