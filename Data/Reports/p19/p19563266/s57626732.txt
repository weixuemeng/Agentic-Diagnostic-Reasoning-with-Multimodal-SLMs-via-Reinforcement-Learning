                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and chills.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The aorta is mildly
 calcified and slightly tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Linear bibasilar densities are compatible with atelectasis.  There
 is mild peribronchial cuff thickening and coarse parencymal densities
 bilaterally that may reflect a viral or atypical infection or underlying
 chronic interstitial disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Basilar atelectasis. 
 2.  Peribronchial cuffing and bilateral interstitial denisties may represent a
 viral or other atypical infection if acute, or underlying interstitial lung
 disease. Comparison with any prior radiographs would help determine
 chronicity.
