                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right main bronchus mass, follow up.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT chest as well as chest radiograph from ___.
 
 The current study redemonstrates total collapse of the right lung due to
 obstructed right main bronchus by the increase in size of the mass.  No
 substantial change in the appearance of the right hemithorax is seen.  Left
 basal opacity appears to be less conspicuous on the current study and might
 reflect slight resolution of aspiration.  The one lung intubation ET tube
 continues toward the left main bronchus bifurcation.
