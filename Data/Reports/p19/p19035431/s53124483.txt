                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged with lymphadenopathy again noted. Enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries likely reflects pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  New patchy opacity in the right lung
 base could reflect an area of infection or atelectasis.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New patchy opacity in the right lung base could reflect an area of infection
 or atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible small
 bilateral pleural effusions.   Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 suggestive of underlying pulmonary hypertension.
