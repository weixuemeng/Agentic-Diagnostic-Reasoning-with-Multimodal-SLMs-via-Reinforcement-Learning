                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating between ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, with selective intubation of the left
 lung with endotracheal tube terminating in the distal left bronchus, unchanged
 in position.  There remains complete collapse of the right lung.  Within the
 left lung, decreased lung volume compared to prior study results in
 accentuation of vascular structures.  Diffuse reticular opacities in the left
 lung may reflect interstitial edema superimposed on known baseline emphysema. 
 More patchy opacities at the left base have increased compared to the prior
 exam and could reflect patchy atelectasis or a developing infectious
 pneumonia.
