                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Increased
 interstitial opacity with mediastinal vascular fullness and Kerley B lines is
 consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema and likely accompanying trace
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis may also be present.  Mild
 cardiomegaly persists with otherwise normal mediastinal and hilar contours. 
 There is no pneumothorax with apical scarring again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with accompanying trace pleural
 effusions.
