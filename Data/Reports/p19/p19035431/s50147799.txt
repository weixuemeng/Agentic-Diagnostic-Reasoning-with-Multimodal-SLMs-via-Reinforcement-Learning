                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate for infectious process
 versus fluid.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP frontal radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the right significantly limiting evaluation of the
 mediastinal structures.  Allowing for these limitations a faint small focal
 opacity in the left upper lobe is not appreciably changed since ___
 and may correspond to scarring.  Bibasilar hazy opacities are likely due to
 atelectasis, however small pleural effusions cannot be excluded on this
 limited frontal radiograph, and there is mild blunting of the lateral
 costophrenic sulci.  The mediastinal structures are not well evaluated,
 however,  the heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities likely a combination of atelectasis and possibly trace
 pleural effusions. 
 2. If clinically indicated a repeat frontal and lateral radiograph with normal
 positioning would provide a more complete evaluation.
