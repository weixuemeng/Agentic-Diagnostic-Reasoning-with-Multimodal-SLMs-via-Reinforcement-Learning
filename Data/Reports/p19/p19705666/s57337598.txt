 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Left basal pleural drain is still in place.  Left pleural effusion is small
 warrant hilar resolved and there is no longer any evidence of pneumothorax. 
 New peribronchial opacification at the base of the right lung could be due to
 aspiration or atelectasis but should be followed for the possibility of early
 pneumonia.  Heart size is top-normal.  Mild vascular engorgement suggests
 early cardiac decompensation.
 
 Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis is exaggerated by positioning.
