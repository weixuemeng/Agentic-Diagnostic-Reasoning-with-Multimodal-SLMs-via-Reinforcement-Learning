                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p part 1 thoracic fusion; now febrile
 +cough  // eval pneumonia vs atelectasis      eval pneumonia vs atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Mild edema is new since ___ accompanied by increase in heart size and
 mediastinal vascular caliber.  Abnormality in the left hemithorax is more
 pronounced.  Left lower lobe is largely airless and left pleural effusion is
 at least moderate.  Contribution of atelectasis versus pneumonia is
 radiographically indeterminate.
 
 Left apical pleural drainage catheter has been withdrawn one a 2 cm since the
 prior study.  Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  It is possible that chest CT, performed with intravenous
 contrast if the patient can tolerate it, would be helpful in distinguishing
 pleural from paraspinal fluid collections and atelectasis from pneumonia.
