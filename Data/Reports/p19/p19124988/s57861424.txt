                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a right pneumothorax after
 esophagogastroduodenoscopy and esophageal dilatation.  Evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:53 p.m.:
 
 Small right pneumothorax is smaller today than it was on ___.  There
 is no appreciable right pleural effusion.  Contrast pooling in the mediastinum
 just above the gastroesophageal junction is described on the fluoroscopic
 esophagram performed earlier today as pooling in the dilated distal esophagus,
 with no evidence of esophageal or gastric leak.  That is the determination
 that I cannot make on this study.
 
 The heart size is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There has been a
 posterior osteotomy of the left seventh rib.
