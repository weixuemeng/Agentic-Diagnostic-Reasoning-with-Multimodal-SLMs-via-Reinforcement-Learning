 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:15 AM
  NG tube projects over the left main bronchus and: back and is either within
  the airway or within a large hiatal hernia and should be repositioned. 
  Bilateral infrahilar and right suprahilar opacity is likely representative of
  aspiration or pneumonia.  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is mildly enlarged with tortuous thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are difficult to fully evaluate due to presence of increased
 bilateral infrahilar and right suprahilar opacities likely representative of
 aspiration.  There is no large pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax. 
 An NG tube projects over the contour of the left main stem bronchus and the
 tip is flipped around directed superiorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased bilateral infrahilar and right suprahilar opacities likely
 representative of aspiration or possibly atelectasis.
 2.  Malpositioned NG tube located in the supradiaphragmatic location
 projecting over the left main stem bronchus most likely in a large hiatal
 hernia vs contained within the airway.  The former is more probable given the
 wide turn the distal tube makes.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:15 a.m.
 on ___ five minutes after discovery.
