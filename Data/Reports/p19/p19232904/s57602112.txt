                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema, dyspnea, history of CHF.  Evaluate for
 abnormalities.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT thorax ___.  Radiograph of the chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small opacity in the periperhy of the left lower lung represents chronic
 atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pulmonary edema. There are likely tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Lung volumes are increased compatible with COPD.
 The calcified right thyroid nodule is redemonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Increased lung volumes compatible with COPD.
 
 3. Chronic mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 4. Possibly tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
