                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low in volume with dense retrocardiac and patchy right
 basal opacities, which may reflect atelectasis; however, particularly on the
 left, pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  Accompanying pleural effusions
 may also be present.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is moderately to
 markedly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dense retrocardiac opacity and bibasal opacities could reflect atelectasis
 and pleural effusion; however, infectious process would be difficult to
 exclude.  Accompanying pleural effusion, particularly on the left, may also be
 present.  Consider PA and lateral examination with full inspiration to better
 assess.
 2.  Moderate to marked cardiomegaly.
