                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p L VATS hematoma evacuation LUL hematoma and
 mediastinoscopy LN sampling ___  // interval cxr
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and Tubes: Again visualized are 2 left-sided chest tubes in unchanged
 position.  The laterally located chest tube has a side hole projecting in the
 subcutaneous tissues of the lateral chest wall, as before.
 
 Lungs: There is persistent near complete opacification of the left hemi
 thorax, likely a combination of known hematoma/pleural effusion and
 postsurgical changes including atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No right
 pleural effusion present
 
 Pleura: Known left hematoma, status post VATS for evacuation.  No right
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Mediastinum: Mild cardiomegaly with shift of mediastinum to the left side.
 
 Bony thorax: No significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax sparing the
 left upper lobe, likely a combination of residual pleural effusion/hemothorax
 and underlying atelectasis.
 2 left-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position. The laterally located
 chest tube has a side hole projecting in the subcutaneous tissues of the
 lateral chest wall, as before.
 Right lung clear, no right pleural effusion.
