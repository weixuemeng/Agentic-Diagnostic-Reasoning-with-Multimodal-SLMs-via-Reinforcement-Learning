                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To evaluate pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the previous study, there are moderate pleural
 effusions bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  Enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacification reflects atelectasis as
 well as effusion.  No definite vascular congestion.
