                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates bibasilar opacity
 likely reflecting atelectasis with superimposed mild lower lobe edema, worse
 on the right.  Small bilateral effusions may be present, but this is
 incompletely evaluated without a lateral view.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged and normal in size.  There are post-surgical changes of median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  A left chest pacemaker
 with atrial and ventricular leads is unchanged in appearance.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect mild CHF.
