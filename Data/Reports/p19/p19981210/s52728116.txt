                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AVR, CAD, hypertension, asthma, presenting with dyspnea,
 orthopnea and peripheral edema.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Surgical clips again
 project over the mediastinum following coronary artery bypass graft.  Left
 chest wall pacemaker has leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The
 heart is top normal, unchanged.
 
 There are small worsening bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities
 likely atalectasis. There is calcification of the aortic arch.  Interstitial
 pulmonary edema is mild. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Stable mild cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and
 interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 
 2. Mild bibasilar opacities likely reflect atalectasis, less likely pneumonia.
