                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Febrile neutropenia, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild to moderate persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left, which is unchanged from the prior study. 
 A right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the
 proximal right atrium.  There is no focal opacity concerning for pneumonia,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  A streaky opacity on the lateral
 radiograph in the anterior lung base likely represents minor atelectasis.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
