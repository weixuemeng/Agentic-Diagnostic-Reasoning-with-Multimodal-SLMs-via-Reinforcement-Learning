                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of high fever and altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is an
 ill-defined subtle retrocardiac opacity projecting over the lower spine
 concerning for infection.  Dense ill-defined material projecting over the
 mediastinum may be external to the patient as it is not localized on the
 lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The bones are intact.  The imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle retrocardiac opacity may represent infection in the
 correct clinical setting.
