                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent history of
 pneumonia and question of anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is resolution of
 previously demonstrated bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions.  The
 current assessment of the right lower lung demonstrates no evidence of
 abnormal vein structures that would be concerning for a scimitar abnormality. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is currently seen.
