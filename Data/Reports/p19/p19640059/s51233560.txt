  Similar findings of fibrosis.  Air-fluid level in the esophagus which can be
  seen with CREST; also cluster of what appear to represent pill fragments at
  the gastroesophageal junction - please correlate clinically for substantial
  motility problem and consideration of any potential aspiration risk.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss with hypoxia and leukocytosis. 
 Background of CREST and chronic interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged, including calcification and unfolding
 along the aorta.  There is similar moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is again a coarse reticular abnormality favoring the bases
 and peripheral aspects of the lung, most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Parenchymal findings appear stable allowing for small differences in
 technique.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view
 depicts air-fluid level in the mediastinum suggesting esophageal fluid which
 could be seen with esophageal dysmotility that may accompany CREST syndrome. 
 In addition, there is a cluster of small densities, possibly pill fragments,
 three altogether projecting near the expected site of the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Stable findings of chronic interstitial lung disease without definite
 evidence for superimposed process.  
 
 2.  Air-fluid level in the esophagus which could be seen with known CREST
 syndrome.  In addition, there is a cluster of small densities, possibly pill
 fragments, three altogether, projecting near the expected site of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Clinical correlation regarding any potential
 aspiration risk is recommended.
