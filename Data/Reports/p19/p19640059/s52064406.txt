                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of IPF and new left upper lobe
 infiltrate, on antibiotics.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation is limited by head positioning,
 which obscures the lung apices.  Within this limitation, there is little
 change in left upper lung opacity.  Low lung volumes and reticular opacities
 at the lung bases are unchanged and consistent with stated history of IPF. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IIMPRESSION: No change in left upper lung opacity or findings related to IPF.
