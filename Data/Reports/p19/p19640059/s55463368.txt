                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Tachypnea.  Patient with history of IPF, pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are lower lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with
 cardiomegaly and enlarged main pulmonary arteries.  Patient has known
 pulmonary fibrosis with interstitial abnormalities, larger in the lower lobes
 bilaterally.  These opacities have minimally increased, partially due to the
 lower lung volumes, but an acute exacerbation of IPF is suspected.  There is
 no focus of lobar pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 2:00 p.m.
