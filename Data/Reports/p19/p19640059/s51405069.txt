                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with known IPF, now with severe dyspnea and
 tachypnea.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier and multiple
 several radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and CT from ___.
 
 There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly, unchanged from prior study.  The
 pulmonary arteries are enlarged.  This suggests the presence of pulmonary
 hypertension.  The aorta is tortuous.  The patient has known chronic fibrotic
 interstitial lung disease with peripheral and bilateral lower lobe and right
 middle lobe predominance.  Superimposed on this chronic finding, there is new
 ill-defined opacity in the right lower hemithorax consistent with infection. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
