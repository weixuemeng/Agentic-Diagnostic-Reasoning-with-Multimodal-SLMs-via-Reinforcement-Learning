                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath,
 rule out infection versus fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist, x-ray was repeated due to patient kyphosis.
 
 The patient's chin overlies the lung apices.  Again seen are increased
 interstitial markings, worse at the lung bases in this patient with history of
 known chronic interstitial pulmonary disease.  Opacity at the right lung base
 appears increased compared to the prior study and superimposed infectious
 process is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known chronic interstitial disease with increased interstitial
 markings seen at the lung bases.  Interval increase in right base opacity
 raises concern for a superimposed infectious process.
