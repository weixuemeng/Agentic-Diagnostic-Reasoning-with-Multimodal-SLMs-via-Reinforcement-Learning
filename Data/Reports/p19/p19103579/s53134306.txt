                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The rib fractures are not optimally seen
 on this study.  If clinically warranted, special oblique views for the ribs
 could be obtained.
