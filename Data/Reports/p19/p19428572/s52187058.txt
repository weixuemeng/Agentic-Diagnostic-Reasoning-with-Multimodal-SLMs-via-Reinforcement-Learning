                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal streaky opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases without focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia
