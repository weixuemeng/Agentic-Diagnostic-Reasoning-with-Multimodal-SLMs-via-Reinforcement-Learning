                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent mitral valve repair and biliary stent
 placement, now with chest pain.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS: There is pleural thickening and irregular linear opacity along the
 right lateral lower lung with adjacent soft tissue metallic clips, chronicity
 indeterminate.  Mitral valve replacement hardware is seen.  No focal pulmonary
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Biliary stent is partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Right pleural thickening with adjacent soft tissue clips,
 chronicity indeterminate.  Although this could be postsurgical in nature,
 underlying lung pathology cannot be excluded and correlation with prior exams
 would be helpful.
