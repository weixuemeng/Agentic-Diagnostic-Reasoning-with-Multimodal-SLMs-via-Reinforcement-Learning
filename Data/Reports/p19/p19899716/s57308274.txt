 associated left basilar linear atelectasis.  It is likely similar is size
 accounting for differences between the PA and AP images.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The aortic arch appears more
 prominent, likely due to rotation.
