 AP CHEST, 5:26 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Chest and abdominal pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 5:34 a.m.:
 
 Progressive opacification at the lung bases is particularly more severe on the
 left and therefore could be due to developing pneumonia, particularly due to
 aspiration.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural effusion
 is small, on the left, if any.
