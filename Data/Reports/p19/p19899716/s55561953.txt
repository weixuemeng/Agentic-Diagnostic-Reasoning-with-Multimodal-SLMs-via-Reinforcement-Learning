                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis.  Reevaluate atelectasis at right lower lobe.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small left pleural effusion is stable, and likely represents
 irritation from patient's known pancreatitis.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 unchanged and still persists on the right.  There is no pleural effusion on
 the right.  Lung volumes are larger than in the previous chest x-ray, which
 makes the cardiac silhouette appear more normal.  There is no definite
 enlargement of the cardiac size in today's examination.  There is no
 congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
