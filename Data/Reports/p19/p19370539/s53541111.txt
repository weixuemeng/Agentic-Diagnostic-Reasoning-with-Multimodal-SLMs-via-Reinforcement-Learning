 INDICATION:  History: ___F with wall  // eval cardiomegaly, CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Subtle left base opacity is most likely due to
 atelectasis and overlying vascular structures although a subtle consolidation
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema.  Subtle opacity at
 the left lung base most likely due to atelectasis and/ or overlying vascular
 structures although early consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
