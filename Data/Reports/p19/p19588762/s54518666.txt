  Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities in the setting of cardiomegaly and
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely represent mild pulmonary edema.
  Underlying pneumonia be difficult to exclude and clinical correlation is
  recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/dizziness, please eval for occult PNA  // ___M w/dizziness,
 please eval for occult PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with enlargement of the pulmonary vasculature and diffuse
 airspace opacities, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  A more confluent
 opacity at the right lung base could reflect asymmetrical edema or secondary
 process such as pneumonia.  No evidence pneumothorax.  No significant pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  Underlying pneumonia in right lung base is
 difficult to exclude and follow-up radiograph after diuresis is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up radiograph after diuresis is recommended.
