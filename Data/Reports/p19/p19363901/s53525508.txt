                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Convexity along the right
 paratracheal stripe may reflect tortuous vessels.  Right hilar prominence may
 reflect underlying lymphadenopathy.  Mediastinal and left hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Increased
 interstitial opacities are seen in the lung bases, potentially reflective of a
 chronic changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  There mild degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial opacities the lung bases, potentially reflective of
 chronic changes.  No focal consolidation.
 2. Right hilar prominence may be suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy.
