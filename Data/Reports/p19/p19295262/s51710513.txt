                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new change in mental status and
 focal crackles on left.  Possible evolution of consolidation observed on
 yesterday's chest examination.  Is there now pneumonia?.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy and status post
 aortic valve replacement (porcine type) appears unchanged.  The heart size is
 not increased.  Previously identified pacer in left anterior axillary position
 connected to two intracavitary electrode system unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestive pattern as before, but no evidence of increased congestion and no
 signs of newly developed pleural effusions in either right or left, as well as
 posterior pleural sinuses.  No new parenchymal infiltrates can be identified. 
 When comparison is extended to a portable chest examination of ___, the patient was markedly more congested than now and had some pleural
 effusions and more marked perivascular haze than it exists now.
 
 On examination yesterday and today, congestive pattern is much less marked and
 is stable.  Thus, no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified.
