                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluate heart and lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary
 parenchymal opacifications are evident across multiple prior radiographs
 dating back to ___; however, opacifications appear slightly increased on
 today's exam, possibly reflecting worsened background pulmonary edema, though
 superimposed infectious process is not definitively excluded.  Stable
 elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 appears unchanged, but cannot exclude a small right pleural effusion. 
 Pacemaker leads and sternotomy sutures are intact.  No osseous lesion evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent but increasingly prominent bilateral pulmonary
 opacities may reflect chronic disease superimposed on background edema, though
 cannot exclude superimposed infectious process.  Possible small right pleural
 effusion.
