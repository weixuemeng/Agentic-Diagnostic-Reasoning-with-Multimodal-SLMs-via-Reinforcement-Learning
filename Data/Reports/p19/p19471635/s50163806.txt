                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, shortness of breath, relapsed APML.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size
 is accentuated as a result of low lung volumes, and is likely borderline
 enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection,
 particularly in the right lung base, is difficult to exclude.  Blunting of
 left costophrenic sulcus is similar compared to the prior exam, and likely
 attributable to mild pleural thickening.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limits assessment of the lung bases. Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, but infection is difficult to
 exclude.  Recommend repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory effort (when
 patient is able to) for further assessment.
