                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  AML and fever and abdominal pain.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of right atrium.  Heart size,
 mediastinum are unchanged.  There is a left basal atelectasis but
 alternatively it might be developing infectious process.  Right atelectasis
 due to elevated right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  If clinically warranted, correlation
 with chest CT might be considered.
 
 There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air based on this suboptimal
 radiograph.
