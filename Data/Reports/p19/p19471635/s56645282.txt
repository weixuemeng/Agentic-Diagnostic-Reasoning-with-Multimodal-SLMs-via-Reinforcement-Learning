  Worsening opacity at the right base, likely reflecting atelectasis.  Infection
  is not excluded. Increased cephalization of vessels and prominence of the
  azygos vein is consistent with mild edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions
  are likely.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // PNA? Edema? Atelectasis?     
 PNA? Edema? Atelectasis?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at
 the right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. Although this could
 represent merely atelectasis and effusion, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.  There is fullness of the
 pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
 Central catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
