                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute promyelocytic leukemia with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate lungs. 
 There is mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which likely represents
 atelectasis, and is unchanged. There is a subtle opacity in the right middle
 lung field which may represent a composite shadow, however underlying
 parenchymal abnormality cannot be excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged from the prior radiograph.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Cannot exclude underlying
 nodule in the right middle lung field subtle opacity. Recommend repeat
 radiograph for further evaluation.
