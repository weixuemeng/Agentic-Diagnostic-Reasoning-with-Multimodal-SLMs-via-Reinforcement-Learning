                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right central catheter has
 been removed.  Bibasilar opacifications again are consistent with atelectasis,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
