                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are relatively well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is likely normal in size with
 tortuous aortic contour.  Moderate hiatal hernia is also suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity in expected location of moderate hiatal
 hernia.  This could be further evaluated on PA and lateral views if no history
 of such.  No acute intrathoracic process.
