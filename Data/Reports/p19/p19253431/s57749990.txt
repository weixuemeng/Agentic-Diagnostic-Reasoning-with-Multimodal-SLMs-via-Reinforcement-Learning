                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent diagnosis of HIV and PCP presenting with
 shortness of breath. Crackles on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Diffuse ill-defined airspace opacities are noted in both lungs,
 more pronounced in the left lung compared to the right.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse ill-defined opacities in both lungs, more pronounced on the left. 
 Findings are concerning for either multifocal pneumonia or PCP, although the
 latter would be somewhat atypical given the somewhat asymmetric distribution
 of the airspace opacities.
