                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMHx inc recently Dx'd HIV s/p mult episodes
 PJP w/ slow recovery   persist hypoxia. Denies baseline lung dz prior to PJP
 Dx.  // Surveillance XR to monitor improvement from PJP and quantify degree of
 residual scarring/damage
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistently low lung volumes.  Overall improvement of ground-glass opacities
 better seen on prior CT.  There are however peribronchial opacities in the
 left upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes, left greater than right.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The pleural surfaces are
 normal.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe and bilateral lower lobe opacities.  Some may represent
 chronic fibrotic changes while some may represent resolving infection.
