                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from the prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  There is flattening of the right hemidiaphragm with
 elevation suggestive of a subpulmonic effusion on the right although not
 substantial on the lateral view.  There is patchy peribronchial opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung, apparently within the lingula which could
 be seen in the setting of bronchial inflammation.  An oval opacity in the
 right upper lung, probably in the right upper lobe, appears somewhat more
 dense than before and may be associated with mucous plugging.  Degenerative
 changes appear similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected right-sided pleural effusion, which may be have
 increased.  Patchy areas of bronchovascular opacities suggesting airway
 inflammation and possibly mucous plugging.
