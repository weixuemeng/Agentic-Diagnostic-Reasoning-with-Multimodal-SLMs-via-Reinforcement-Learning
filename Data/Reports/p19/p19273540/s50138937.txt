                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Minimal opacification at the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process such as pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
