                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Mildly
 prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are better assessed on recent
 prior CT.  Additionally, scattered subcentimeter nodular opacities seen on
 prior CT are better evaluated on that study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
