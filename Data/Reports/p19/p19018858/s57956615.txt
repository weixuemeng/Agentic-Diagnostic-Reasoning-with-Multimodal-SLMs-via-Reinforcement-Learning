                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD 3 CABG  // effusion/atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a right internal jugular catheter
 is been removed with no visible right apical pneumothorax.  Air-fluid level in
 the retrosternal region on the lateral radiograph could reflect postoperative
 gas within the mediastinum or anterior loculated hydro pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis has improved.  Small residual pleural effusions are present.
