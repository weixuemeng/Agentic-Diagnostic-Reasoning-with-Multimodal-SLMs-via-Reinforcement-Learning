                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison made with a prior CT of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  There is interval
 development of mild interstitial edema.  There is slight asymmetric increase
 in opacity in the right upper lobe, which could represent a superimposed
 consolidation/pneumonia.  Mediastinal prominence could be due to portable AP
 technique.  Bony structures are intact.  Heart size appears grossly within
 normal limits.  No large effusion is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema with possible superimposed pneumonia in the
 right upper lobe.  Please note evaluation limited given portable AP technique.
