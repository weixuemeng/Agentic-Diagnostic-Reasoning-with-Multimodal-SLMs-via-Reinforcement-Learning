                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and weakness.  Evaluate for an acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is limited by patient's rotation.  Within limitations,
 there are persistent streaky opacities in the left mid and lower lung zones,
 which are stable from the prior chest radiograph and CT.  This likely
 represents chronic atelectasis or scarring.  Additionally, there is a linear
 opacity in the right lower lung zone, which is also stable.  No new opacity is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable bibasilar linear opacities, likely representing
 atelectasis or scarring.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
