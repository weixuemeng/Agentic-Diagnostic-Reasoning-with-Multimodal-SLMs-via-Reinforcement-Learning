                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 streaky opacities in the left mid and lower lung which may be due to
 atelectasis/scarring, although infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There may be a very trace left pleural
 effusion.  The mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient's
 positioning.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  No pneumothorax.
