 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Diffuse rhonchi.  Assess fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is known
 scarring in the left lower lobe which likely accounts for the subtle
 retrocardiac opacity.  There is a stable area of scarring in the lingula
 inferiorly.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or overt CHF.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable areas of scarring at the left lung base.  No definite
 signs of pneumonia or CHF.
