 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Again, the aorta is markedly
 tortuous, dilated with a stent graft, similar to prior study.  Thoracic
 scoliosis is noted.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles which may be due to
 the lungs being hyperinflated, trace pleural effusions not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, trace pleural effusions
 not excluded.  Otherwise, no significant interval change from the prior study.
