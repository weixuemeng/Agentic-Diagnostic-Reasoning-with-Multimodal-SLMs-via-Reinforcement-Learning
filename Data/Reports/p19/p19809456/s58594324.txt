                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with COPD and worsening shortness of
 breath and hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the
 prior exam, there is development of lower lung opacities which could represent
 pneumonia with associated pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart remains enlarged.  There is a stent
 coursing through the entire descending thoracic aorta, unchanged.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen.  The imaged osseous
 structures appear intact with a mild scoliosis again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild pulmonary edema with bilateral lower lobe
 opacities, which could represent an early pneumonia.  Small bilateral
 effusions, right greater than left.  Stable cardiomegaly and post-surgical
 changes in the descending thoracic aorta.
