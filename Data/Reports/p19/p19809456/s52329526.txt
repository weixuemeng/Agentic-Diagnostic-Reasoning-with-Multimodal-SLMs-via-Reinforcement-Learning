                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ as well as chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate unchanged degree of cardiomegaly
 and stable appearance of large and tortuous intrathoracic aorta with large
 endovascular stent graft.  The lungs are hyperinflated and there is relative
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms, not significantly changed since prior study.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The costophrenic angles are not well seen on the
 lateral images, possibly reflecting trace bilateral pleural effusions or
 atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
