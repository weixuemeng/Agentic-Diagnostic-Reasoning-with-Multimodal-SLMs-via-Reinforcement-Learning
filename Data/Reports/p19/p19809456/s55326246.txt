 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 aortic stent graft in a tortuous aorta is again seen.  Patient is status post
 sternotomy.  In the interval since the prior study, there has been interval
 increase in bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, worrisome for
 pneumonia.  However, findings could also relate to aspiration.  There are
 likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right basilar opacity and to a lesser
 extent, left basilar opacity could be due to infection and/or aspiration. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
