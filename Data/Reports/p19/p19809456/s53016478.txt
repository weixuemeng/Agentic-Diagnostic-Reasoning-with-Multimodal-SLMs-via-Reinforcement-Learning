                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheobronchial malacia, recent trach  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___, chest CTA 8 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left PICC terminates in the SVC.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
 The aortic stent graft extending from the aortic arch to the diaphragmatic
 hiatus is stable in position.  A Dobhoff tube ends in the proximal stomach. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Mild widening of the upper
 mediastinum corresponds to enlarged ascending aorta, which has been previously
 repaired. Small dependent pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis are
 decreased.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded and clear. 
 A small nodular opacity in the right middle lobe was seen on recent chest CT. 
 There is no pneumoperitoneum.  Dextroscoliosis centered in mid thoracic spine
 is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in small bilateral pleural effusions and basal 
 atelectasis.
 2.  Dobhoff tube ends in the proximal stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Advancement of the Dobhoff tube by several cm is
 recommended for more optimal positioning.
