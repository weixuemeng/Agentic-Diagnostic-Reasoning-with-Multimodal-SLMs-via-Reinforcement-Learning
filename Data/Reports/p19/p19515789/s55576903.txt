                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Mechanical fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The aorta is moderately tortuous with patchy
 calcification. A perihilar opacity on the left does not appear particularly
 mass-like and would typically be more suggestive of pneumonia, involving the
 lingula and posterior basilar left lower lobe.  There is a small pleural
 effusion on the right and a very small one on the left. Streaky opacities in
 the right hemithorax suggest chronic scarring. There is no pneumothorax.  The
 bones appear demineralized. No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar opacity that does not appear particularly mass-like, most
 suggestive of pneumonia based on imaging, although other etiologies such as
 atelectasis, chronic scarring or even aspiration could be considered,
 depending on clinical circumstances, if clinical findings do not suggest
 pneumonia. In any case follow-up radiographs are recommended within eigth
 weeks in order to show resolution and exclude the much less likely possibility
 of neoplasm. If available, correlation with prior radiographs would also be
 useful.
