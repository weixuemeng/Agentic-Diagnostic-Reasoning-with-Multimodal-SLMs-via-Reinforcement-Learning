 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Anterior mediastinal mass, status post surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:34 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly improved, but areas of atelectasis are still visible at both lung
 bases.  The right chest tube is in unchanged position.  A mediastinal drain
 appears to have been removed.  The clips and sternal wires are in constant
 position.  No new parenchymal opacities, unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
