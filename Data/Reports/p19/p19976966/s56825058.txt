                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of enteric tube with tip terminating in the
 region of the duodenum.  Diffusely distended loops of small and large bowel in
 the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this study and would be more
 fully assessed by standard abdominal radiographic series.  Within the chest,
 there are persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation.
