 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic RCC.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right large-bore internal jugular approach catheter tip remains in unchanged
 position within the upper SVC.  A right basilar chest tube tip also remains in
 stable position.  There are scattered areas of right greater than left basilar
 atelectasis.  In addition there is apparent nodular opacification such as
 projecting over the left mid lung zone measuring up to 9 mm where previously
 smaller pulmonary nodules were noted on CT examination from ___.  There
 is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without frank interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 demonstrating mild cardiomegaly.  There are no large pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed in the interim.  The epidural catheter
 is no longer apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Removal of the endotracheal tube. Remaining support hardware in unchanged
 positions.
 2.  Nodular opacification demonstrated within the left mid lung zone where
 previously noted smaller pulmonary nodules were noted on ___ is
 concerning for progression of disease.
