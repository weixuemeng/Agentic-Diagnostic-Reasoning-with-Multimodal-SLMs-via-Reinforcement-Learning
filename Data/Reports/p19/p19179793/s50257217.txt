                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with brain
 metastasis presenting with worsening headache.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle right
 lower chest opacities are more conspicuous as compared to the prior study and
 not definitively seen on chest CT from ___, worrisome for worsening
 metastatic disease.  There is also increase in the left mid to lower lung
 opacity raising concern for left lower lobe consolidation which could be
 related to infection and/or metastatic disease.  Evidence of multiple left rib
 lateral lesions again seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
