                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Chronic alcoholic.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  A number of calcifications project
 over the lower central mediastinum and suggest calcified subcarinal lymph
 nodes.  A calcified granuloma is noted in the right lung.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear, however, without evidence for acute process.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable aside from
 mild degenerative changes along the mid thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Calcified granuloma in the mid right lung and clustered
 calcifications in the mediastinum, probably associated with prior
 granulomatous exposure.  No evidence of acute disease, however.
