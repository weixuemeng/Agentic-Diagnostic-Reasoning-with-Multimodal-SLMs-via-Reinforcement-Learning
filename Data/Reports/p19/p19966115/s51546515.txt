                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a retrocardiac opacity that is not
 specific obscuring medial left hemidiaphragmatic contours.  Otherwise the
 lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity, which could be seen with atelectasis, although an
 infectious process is not excluded and results should be correlated with
 clinical presentation.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
