                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect a combination of the patient's known bronchiectasis and
 fibrosis with superimposed atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is unchanged.  Known right hilar mass is better assessed on the previous
 radiograph.  Marked degenerative changes are seen involving the left shoulder
 with narrowing of the left acromiohumeral interval suggestive of underlying
 rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Known right hilar mass is better assessed on the previous CT.
 3. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect a combination of atelectasis
 as well as known bronchiectasis with fibrotic changes.
