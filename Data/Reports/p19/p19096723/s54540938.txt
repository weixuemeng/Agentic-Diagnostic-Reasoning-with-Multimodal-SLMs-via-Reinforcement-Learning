                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, here to evaluate for mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed at___ on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pectoral pacemaker is in place with two leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are prominent, with unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta but the aortic knob remains distinct.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and lucency at the lung
 apices, compatible with COPD.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. 
 There is improved pulmonary vascular congestion from the outside radiograph of
 ___.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No mediastinal widening.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions. Improved mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion from the outside radiograph of ___.
