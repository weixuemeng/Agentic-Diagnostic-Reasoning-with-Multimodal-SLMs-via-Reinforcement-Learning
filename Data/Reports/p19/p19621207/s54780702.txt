                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, confusion  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 suggests small bilateral pleural effusions are identified. On the frontal view
 there is more dense opacity at the left lung base without correlative finding
 on the lateral view suggesting at least some component of atelectasis.
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette there is mildly
 enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the aorta. Degenerative
 changes seen at the shoulders bilaterally. No displaced fractures there noted.
 Compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral effusions. More dense retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view
 suggests component of atelectasis as it is not clearly delineated on the
 lateral view although component of infection is possible.
