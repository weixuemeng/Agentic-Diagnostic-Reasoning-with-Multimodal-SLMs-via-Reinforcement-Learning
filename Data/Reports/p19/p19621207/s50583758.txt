                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with leukocytosis concerning for occult infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications and unchanged mild tortuosity.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise within normal limits.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with mild
 emphysematous changes again demonstrated.  Small left pleural effusion appears
 not substantially changed in the interval with left basilar opacity likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis.  No large right pleural effusion is
 demonstrated, and no pneumothorax is detected.  Dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is again noted.  Marked degenerative changes of both
 glenohumeral joints as well as a narrowed right acromiohumeral interval is
 suggestive of rotator cuff disease.  Remote right-sided tenth rib fracture is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity, likely
 compressive atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
