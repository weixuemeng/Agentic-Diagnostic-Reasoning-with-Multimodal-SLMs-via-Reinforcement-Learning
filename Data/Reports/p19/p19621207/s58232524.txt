                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with exertional shortness of breath,
 desaturates with ambulation, mild rhonchi on left base, evaluate for
 infiltrates versus CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with two previous chest
 examinations dated ___ and ___.  The heart size
 remains within normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Mild degree of general widening of the thoracic aorta is again
 noted as well as mild elongation of the descending aorta following the
 left-sided convex scoliotic curvature of the thoracic spine.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of new acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are present.  As before, the generally, irregular pulmonary
 vascular peripheral distribution in this elderly woman appears to represent
 some form of emphysema/COPD, but no new acute parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified.  No pleural effusions are seen.  As before, diffuse
 demineralization of the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine is noted with
 some mild compression deformities in the mid and lower portion, but no
 significant interval changes since the previous studies can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of cardiac enlargement, CHF or
 acute infiltrates in this elderly female patient.
