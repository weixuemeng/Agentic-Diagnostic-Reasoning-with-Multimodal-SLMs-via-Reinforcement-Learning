                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with port. Unable to flush.  // Port catheter tip
 position?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium, unchanged.  Heart size appears borderline enlarged, likely due to AP
 technique and lower lung volumes.  A coronary artery stent is re-
 demonstrated.  Enteric tube tip terminates in the stomach.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal atelectasis
 is noted in the lung bases.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Clips
 are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the SVC/right atrial junction,
 unchanged.
 2. Low lung volumes with mild atelectasis in the lung bases.
