                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previous opacity at the right base is significantly improved.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Faint opacities in the right mid lung similar
 to prior are likely reflect sequela of prior pneumonia.  Heart size is
 top-normal as before.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are degenerative changes in the
 right AC and partially imaged left AC joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
