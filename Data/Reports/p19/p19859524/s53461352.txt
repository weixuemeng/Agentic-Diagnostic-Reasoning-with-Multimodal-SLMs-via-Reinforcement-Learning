                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The prominence of the interstitium has increased suggesting mild pulmonary
 edema superimposed on patchy opacities in both upper lungs that persist but
 with shifeing morphology, possibly due to scarring or atelectasis, but a
 relatively new finding, not present on remote prior films.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  
 
 2.  Persistent upper lobe opacities with mixed nodular and streaky
 morphologies, probably scarring but not present on remote prior films.  
 
 Accordingly, it may be appropriate to consider follow-up radiographs within
 ___ months to show stability of this appearance.
