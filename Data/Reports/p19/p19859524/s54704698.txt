 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Oxygen requirement, pulmonary edema on previous film. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggestive of
 pulmonary edema have almost completely resolved.  Areas of non-characteristic
 parenchymal scarring at both the left and right mid lung persist.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly also persists.  No pleural effusions.  Mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
