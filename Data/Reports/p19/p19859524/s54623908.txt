                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ as well as CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Penetration is poor secondary to body habitus.  The lower lungs are
 particularly difficult to see and a lateral view would be very helpful in
 assessment. Pulmonary edema present in ___ has cleared. There may be new
 consolidation in the right lower lobe. Left lower lobe is obscured by soft
 tissue and cardiac silhouette, and the cardiac apex is obscured by the
 abdomen. Heart is probably not enlarged, but upper lobe vascular
 redistribution is an indication of borderline cardiac dysfunction. If there
 pleural effusions they are not large.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible right lower lobe pneumonia. Lateral view strongly recommended.
 
 Increased left atrial pressure, but no pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 9:18 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings.
