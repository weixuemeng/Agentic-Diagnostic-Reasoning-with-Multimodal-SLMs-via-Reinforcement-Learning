                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea for four days, rule out pneumonia
 or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and Lateral views of the chest show well expanded and symmetric lungs. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette including mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  In
 comparison to the prior examination, however, there is increased diffuse
 bilateral opacities with perihilar predominance, consistent with worsening
 mild pulmonary edema. A horizontal linear band of opacification in the mid
 left lung likely represents a focus of atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 2.  Mild diffuse pulmonary edema has increased.
