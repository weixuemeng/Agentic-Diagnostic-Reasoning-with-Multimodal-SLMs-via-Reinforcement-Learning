  1.  Limited evaluation due to patient positioning.
  2. Stable small left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity as well as a
  right lower lobe opacity partially obscuring the right hemi diaphragm.
  Findings are most likely related to atelectasis however clinical correlation
  recommended to assess for superimposed infection.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and renal failure with increased
 confusion, SOB, nausea  // ?opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a nasogastric
 tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not
 visualized on the image. The patient also carries a left internal jugular vein
 hemodialysis catheter, with the tip projecting over the right atrium.
 A pre-existing right basal parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved
 but on the left the extent of a pre-existing pleural effusion has slightly
 increased.  Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
