                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man admitted after fall, now w/acute on chronic CHF. 
 // ? pulmonary edema, determine type of PM      ? pulmonary edema, determine
 type of PM
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available for review, but
 the study is read in conjunction with chest CT on ___ which showed
 large dependent, non trans UT ___ of, but nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural
 effusion, and asbestos related pleural plaques, largely calcified.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Pulmonary edema is mild if any.  Most of the
 abnormalities due to persistence of the pleural effusions and new left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Atrioventricular pacer leads
 follow their expected courses, continuous from the left pectoral generator. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.  There is a healed fracture deformity of the proximal right humerus
 with severe degenerative changes at the shoulder.
