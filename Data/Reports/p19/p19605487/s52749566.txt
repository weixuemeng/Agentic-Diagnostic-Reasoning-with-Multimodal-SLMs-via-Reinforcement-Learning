                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis with alcoholic cirrhosis
 and ascites.  Patient presents with anemia and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the upper right atrium.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a small to
 moderate effusion on the left with volume loss including elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and opacity probably due to atelectasis.  A diffuse mild
 interstitial abnormality suggests mild congestion that is new since the prior
 examination.  There is no evidence for free air or pneumomediastinum.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the mid thoracic spine.  The lateral
 view depicts a TIPS shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion with a left-sided
 pleural effusion and probable associated atelectasis.
