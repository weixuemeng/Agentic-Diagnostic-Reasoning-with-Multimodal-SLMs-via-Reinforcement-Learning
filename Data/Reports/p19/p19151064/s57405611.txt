                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of weakness as well as
 swelling and pain, left arm after recent PICC.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 views are suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  Given this, there is
 persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with stomach/bowel seen
 beneath.  There is subsequent persistent shift of the mediastinum to the
 right.  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are also stable.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen, although a small one may be difficult to exclude on the
 lateral view.  Interval removal of PICC line.
