                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for differences in
 technique including mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures in
 association with persistent moderate relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Right lateral pleural thickening is stable.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the right.  A mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality suggests fluid overload or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Blunting of posterior costophrenic sulci may reflect tiny effusions, but the
 lateral view is limited due to soft tissue attenuation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary vascular
 congestion or fluid overload.  Similar moderate relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and cardiomegaly.
