                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is slight prominence of the left hilum, and underlying
 prominent lymph nodes or small consolidation is not excluded.  Dedicated PA
 and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild prominence of the left hilum is non-specific, underlying
 prominent lymph node or small consolidation not excluded.  Dedicated PA and
 lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
