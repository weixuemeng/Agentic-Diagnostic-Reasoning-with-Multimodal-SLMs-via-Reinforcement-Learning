                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Subdural hematoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates about 5 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device
 has leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  The chest appears
 hyperinflated.  A small calcification projecting along the left mid lung
 suggests a granuloma, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of lines, tubes and drains.  No evidence
 of acute disease.
