                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML on chemo with persistent pain at
 central line site.  // Please assess for proper positioning of central line.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a right subclavian catheter
 continues to terminate in the mid superior vena cava.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance with marked enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery contour suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  New
 poorly defined opacities in the left lower lobe could reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration, or evolving infectious pneumonia.
