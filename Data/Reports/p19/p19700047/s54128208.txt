                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML and acute worsening shortness of
 breath.  // Evaluate for pulmonary edema or other cause of acute shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared  with ___ at 12:39 and allowing for technical differences,
 the overall appearance is relatively similar.  The interstitial markings at
 the left base and in the right cardiophrenic region may be slightly coarser. 
 No frank consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The heart is not enlarged and could be slightly smaller.  The enlargement of
 the main pulmonary artery is again noted, in keeping with findings on recent
 CT.
 
 Again noted is left subclavian PICC line, similar in a position, with tip
 overlying the mid/distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall similar appearance to chest x-ray from 1 day earlier.  Interstitial
 markings in the right cardiophrenic region and left base may be slightly
 coarser.  Given the time course, this could reflect asymmetric distribution of
 early CHF.  An interstitial infiltrate is considered less likely but could
 also account for this appearance.
 
 No frank consolidation or effusion.  Minimal left greater right upper zone
 redistribution is unchanged.
