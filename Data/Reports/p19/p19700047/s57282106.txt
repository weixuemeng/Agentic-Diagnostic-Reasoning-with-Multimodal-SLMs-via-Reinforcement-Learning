                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with shortness of breath, increasing phlegm and substernal
 chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Enlargement of the left and main pulmonary arteries
 is again noted, not significantly changed from the prior studies.  The right
 hilar contour is within normal limits.  Emphysema is again seen, most
 pronounced within the lung apices.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung
 base is similar and may reflect minimal atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Emphysema.  Enlargement of the main
 and left pulmonary arteries, unchanged, for which correlation with
 echocardiography, if not previously done, is suggested.
