                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with copd and new aml w/ fever  // eval for pna
 eval for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged including prominence
 of the pulmonary artery consistent with known pulmonary hypertension. 
 Interstitial markings in the lower lobes are slightly more prominent than on
 the previous study and might be concerning for progression of infectious
 process.  No focal consolidations is seen.  No appreciable pleural effusion
 demonstrated.
 
 The prominence of the fissures is on the other hand concerning for mild degree
 of interstitial edema potentially as an additional component to explain the
 above described opacities.  Thus reassessment after diuresis is to be
 considered.
