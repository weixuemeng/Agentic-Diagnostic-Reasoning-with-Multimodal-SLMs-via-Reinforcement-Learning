                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall, hx of multiple pneumonia  // rule out
 pneumonia, or rid fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact. Multiple clips project along the anterior left
 mediastinum. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There are equivocal trace
 bilateral pleural effusions blunting the costophrenic sulci posteriorly. There
 is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt edema.  There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 Evaluation of the osseous structures is limited on this study, however no
 displaced rib fractures detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. Equivocal trace pleural
 effusions.
 2. Limited evaluation of the osseous structures, however no displaced rib
 fracture is detected. If further evaluation is desired a dedicated rib series
 or CT may be obtained.
