                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette in this patient with evidence of previous
 CABG and intact midline sternal wires.  Little overall change in the degree of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left basilar opacification is consistent with
 pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis.
