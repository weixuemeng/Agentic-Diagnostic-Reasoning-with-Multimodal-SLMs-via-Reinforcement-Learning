 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:26 PM
  Endotracheal tube remains 7 cm above the carina, as before, repositioning is
  recommended.  Left internal jugular catheter travels into the right atrium. 
  An enteric tube courses along the esophagus and terminates out of the field of
  view, likely within the stomach.  Right Cordis catheter is been removed.  The
  lungs are unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:32 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after MVR.  Check Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 1:31 p.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube is still excessively high in location, no less than 7 cm
 from the carina, and should be advanced 3-4 cm for secure seating.  I
 discussed this matter personally with physician caring for this patient
 earlier on ___.
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened in the interim, and could be the
 direct result of inappropriate position of the endotracheal tube.  Mild
 pulmonary edema has worsened.  Some left pleural effusion is presumed, but its
 volume cannot be assessed.  Large postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Dual-channel left supraclavicular central venous catheter is in
 standard position.  At least two catheters traverse the esophagus, but their
 courses are not fully imaged, although one may end in the fundus after looping
 more distally.
 
 ___ ___ was paged as soon as the findings were recognized; I discussed
 them with ___ by telephone.
