                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recent pneumonia, currently dyspnea.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are unchanged including prominence of
 main pulmonary artery, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
 The left basal consolidation as well as right basal opacities have
 substantially improved in the interim as well as there is improvement of
 vascular engorgement with still present left retrocardiac opacity might
 reflect sequela of prior infectious process and reassessment in three to four
 weeks for continued documentation of improvement is required.
