                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The previously noted dialysis
 catheter has been removed.  There is severe pulmonary edema, increased from
 prior exam.  Retrocardiac opacity could represent pleural effusion, though
 superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  Followup radiograph
 post-diuresis is advised.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is
 stable.  Hilar vascular engorgement is present.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, probable left pleural effusion. 
 Post-diuresis films may be helpful to exclude underlying left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
