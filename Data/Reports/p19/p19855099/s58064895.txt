                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoglycemia, fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  A large bore
 right-sided central catheter is seen terminating in the proximal right
 atrium/cavoatrial junction.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Left base opacity is seen, with obscuration of the
 diaphragm concerning for a pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  There
 is also hazy opacity at the right lung base, which could relate to layering
 effusion with atelectasis; however, consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting in either lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities on the left could be due to pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although consolidation due to infection is not excluded at either
 lung base.
