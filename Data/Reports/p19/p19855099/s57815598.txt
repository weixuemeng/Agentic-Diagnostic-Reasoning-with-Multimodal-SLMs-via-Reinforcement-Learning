                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ years old woman with postop MRV/CABG, please assess
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  The exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was provided.  All the monitoring
 devices are unchanged and in standard position.  Lung volume is still low,
 with interval increase of lower lung opacification for increased dependent
 lung edema.  Heart size is minimally larger since prior CXR, this interval
 increase might be due to pericardial effusion. 
 Minimal enlargement of the upper mediastinal border is normal postoperative
 appearance after cardiac surgery. 
 There is a new, small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Focal
 atelectasis in the periphery of the right upper lobe is stable.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased  pulmonary edema, especially in the lung bases and new
 left small pleural effusion. Interval increase of heart size might be due
 increased pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is recommended.
