                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pulmonary edema.  Assess edema or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Right lower lobe consolidation and pulmonary vascular congestion have been
 present on virtually all prior chest radiographs, including those since
 ___.  Mild pulmonary edema worsened since ___.  Severe
 cardiomegaly may have improved minimally.  Small pleural effusions are
 pronounced.  Lower lobe opacification has worsened.  This could be just edema
 and atelectasis, but radiographically, I cannot exclude pneumonia.  Left lower
 lobe is barely visible, obscured by the heart.  No pneumothorax.
