 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:38 PM
  No significant change in position of Dobbhoff tube, passing below the level of
  the diaphragm and likely looped in the stomach, with the distal aspect ending
  near the gastric cardia.  Additional lines and tubes are not significantly
  changed in position, including a left internal jugular venous catheter which
  ends within the right atrium, as before; the exact tip position is difficult
  to assess given an overlying external clip.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
  has improved compared to the study from approximately 5 hr ago.  A lobulated
  pleural-based structure projecting over the right upper lung is unchanged.  A
  small to moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:30 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after Dobbhoff tube repositioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 12:10 p.m.
 
 Dobbhoff tube passes into the distal stomach and loops back to the fundus,
 ending alongside an upper enteric drainage tube.  The feeding tube guidewire
 has been withdrawn at least 16 cm from the tip.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular introducer are in standard placements
 respectively.  A left jugular line ends in the right atrium.  Mild pulmonary
 edema has improved since earlier in the day, but heart size has increased. 
 Left lower lobe is particularly consolidated, a feature since at least
 ___, which could be due to pneumonia or persistent atelectasis,
 accompanied by small or larger left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Very
 small right upper costal pleural collection conforms to position of a right
 pleural tube since removed.
