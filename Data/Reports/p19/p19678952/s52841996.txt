                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 vascular crowding.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  The mediastinum is
 prominent, likely due to a tortuous aorta and mediastinal fat.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No obvious focal consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
