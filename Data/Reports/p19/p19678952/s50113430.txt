 // interval change, focal, PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes continue to be low.  There is increased vascular plethora and
 ill-defined vascularity.  Although lung volumes are low on the has a similar
 volume previously when the vasculature did not appear so engorged.  Therefore
 there is likely an element of fluid overload.  It is difficult to assess for
 focal infiltrate given the low lung volumes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vascular plethora likely due to fluid overload
