                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion s/p chest tube  // Pleural
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter with decrease in size
 of the right pleural effusion.  Opacities in the right lower lung zone are
 noted, likely reflect development of pulmonary edema and the patient's
 underlying lung cancer.  Patchy airspace opacities in the left mid to lower
 lung zone have increased and may reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 superimposed infection.  A small left pleural effusion persists.  No
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion status post placement
 of a right pleural pigtail catheter.  No pneumothorax identified.
 
 Persisting and slightly increased mid to lower lung zone airspace opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
