                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC with right malignant pleural effusion
 s/p thoracentesis and chest tube (now removed)  // eval for pleural effusion
 reaccumulation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiographs from ___, there has been
 interval removal of a right pigtail catheter.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are mildly improved, with a possible loculated appearance of the
 right effusion.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities are unchanged and likely
 reflect associated atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  Persistent small right
 apical pneumothorax. There is no new focal consolidation.  Mild central
 vascular congestion with increased interstitial markings could reflect mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Mild tortuosity and unfolding of the thoracic aorta, as before.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Status post removal of right pigtail catheter improved small bilateral
 pleural effusions, with possible loculation on the right.  Persistent small
 right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities suggest atelectasis, less likely
 pneumonia.
 3. Mild central vascular congestion with increased interstitial markings could
 reflect mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
