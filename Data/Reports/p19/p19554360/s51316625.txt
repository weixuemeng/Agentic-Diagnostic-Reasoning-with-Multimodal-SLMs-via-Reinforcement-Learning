                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  COUGH
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  Both the frontal and the lateral radiograph show a large
 masslike consolidation in the right lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, the findings are highly suspicious for pneumonia.  However, given the
 rounded appearance of the lesion, by radiography.  No pleural effusions. 
 Normal size of the heart.
