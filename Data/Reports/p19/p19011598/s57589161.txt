                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and abdominal pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  One AP view of the chest.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly.  A left-sided pacemaker is seen.  Low lung volumes
 crowd the pulmonary vasculature.  There appears to be slight increase in
 vascular markings consistent with pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No focal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement.
