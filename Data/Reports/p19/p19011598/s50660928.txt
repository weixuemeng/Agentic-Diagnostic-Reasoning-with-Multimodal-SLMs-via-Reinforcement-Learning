 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated since the prior examination, the
 endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina.  A dual-lead
 pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle,
 respectively.  An orogastric tube terminates near the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The stomach is mild to moderately distended.  An interstitial
 abnormality with indistinct pulmonary vessels and peribronchial cuffing has
 increased since the prior study.  Although somewhat asymmetric, more prominent
 on the right than left, pulmonary edema is the most likely reason.  Widespread
 pneumonia could be considered, however.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Orogastric tube terminating
 short of the stomach, which appears mildly distended.  Advancing the tube
 somewhat may be helpful if clinically indicated.  Increasing opacities in both
 lungs, greater on the right than left, for which a somewhat asymmetric form of
 pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or even aspiration could be considered clinically.
