                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with pleuritic left-sided chest
 pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low resulting in slight bronchovascular crowding. 
 Nonetheless, the lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion,
 pneumothorax, or edema.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  The hila and pleura are unremarkable.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 slightly elevated, likely secondary to-is but non dilated loops of bowel.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly low lung volumes but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
