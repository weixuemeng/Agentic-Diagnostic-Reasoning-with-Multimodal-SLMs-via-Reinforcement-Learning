                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of breast cancer with increasing dyspnea,
 fatigue, gait unsteadiness and forgetfulness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild right mid lung and lower lung linear opacities seen on the
 frontal view are not appreciated on the lateral view and most likely relate to
 atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified
 and slightly tortuous.  Surgical clips overlie the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild linear opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung on the
 frontal view, not appreciated on the lateral view, most likely relate to
 atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation.
