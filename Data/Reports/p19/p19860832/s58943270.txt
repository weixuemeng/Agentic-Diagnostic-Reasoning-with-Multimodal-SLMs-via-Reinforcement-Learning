                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status and intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates at the inferior margin of the
 clavicles.  Partial right upper lobe collapse with elevation of the minor
 fissure is new since the exam 24 hours ago.  There is a new contour
 irregularity of the left main stem bronchus at the takeoff of the left upper
 lobe bronchus.  Left basilar atelectasis is similar.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right upper lobe partial collapse and contour abnormality of
 the left main stem bronchus suggests the possibility of mucous plugging
 causing the atelectasis.  A bronchoscopy may be helpful to identify and clear
 potential mucous plugging.
 
 Findings were discussed via telephone with Dr. ___ at 10:30 on ___.
