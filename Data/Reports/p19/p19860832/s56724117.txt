                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage, unknown time.  Evaluate for
 consolidation or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph acquired ___ to 14 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 6.2 cm above the carina.  Ill-defined and faint,
 right lower lung opacity is new and the minor fissure is mildly thickened and
 distinctly seen, suggesting  aspiration or atelectasis or asymmetrically mild
 pulmonary edema.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural abnormality.
