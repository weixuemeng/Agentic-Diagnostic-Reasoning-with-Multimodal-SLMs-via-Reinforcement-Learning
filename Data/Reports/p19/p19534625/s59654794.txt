  Right mainstem bronchial intubation. Enteric tube within the stomach. Low lung
  volumes.  Hazy opacities in both lungs, more so on the left may reflect areas
  of atelectasis though contusion or aspiration is not excluded. Component of
  mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment.  A right mainstem bronchial
 intubation is present with the tip of the endotracheal tube at the proximal
 right mainstem bronchus.  Enteric tube tip terminates within the stomach. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the
 mediastinum may reflect low lung volumes and supine positioning.  Crowding of
 the bronchovascular markings is noted, likely due to low lung volumes.  There
 appears to be hazy ill-defined opacities within both lungs, more so on the
 left.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No displaced
 fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right mainstem bronchial intubation.
 2. Enteric tube within the stomach.
 3. Low lung volumes.  Hazy opacities in both lungs, more so on the left, may
 reflect areas of atelectasis though contusion or aspiration is not excluded.
