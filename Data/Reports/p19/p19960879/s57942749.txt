                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  The hilar contours are stable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is likely attributable to low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced on
 the left rather than right, and may be slightly improved compared to the prior
 study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated, and there are no
 displaced fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflective of atelectasis though
 aspiration is not excluded.  Overall, the aeration of the lung bases is
 slightly improved compared to the prior exam.
