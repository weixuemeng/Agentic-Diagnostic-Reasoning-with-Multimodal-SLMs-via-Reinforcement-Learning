 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with unwitnessed fall with intracranial
 hemorrhage, assess for acute intrathoracic injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  There is bibasilar
 opacity, likely atelectasis, though a component of aspiration not excluded. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly unremarkable aside from an unfolded partially calcified thoracic
 aorta.  No definite bony injuries are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, possible mild aspiration.  Otherwise, no
 acute findings.
