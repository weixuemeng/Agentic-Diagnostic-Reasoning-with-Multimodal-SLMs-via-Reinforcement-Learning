                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest tightness, history of asthma and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Assessment of the lungs
 demonstrate diffuse opacities involving both upper and lower lobes, right
 slightly more than left, lower lobe substantially more upper lobe and given
 the patient's symptoms, these findings might reflect interval development of
 infectious process, for example viral or atypical.  No pleural effusion is
 seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
