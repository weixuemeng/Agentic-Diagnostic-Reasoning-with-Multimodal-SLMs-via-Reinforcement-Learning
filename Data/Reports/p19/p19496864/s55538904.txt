 OG tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The orogastric tube extends to the mid body of the
 stomach with the side port distal to the esophagogastric junction. 
 Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Right IJ
 catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
 Cardiac silhouette is at upper limits of normal in size.  There may be minimal
 vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural
 fluid and layering effusions.  What appears to be calcification E in the right
 hemi diaphragmatic pleura suggests asbestos related disease.
