                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, have been
 diuresing but persistently hypoxic  // evidence of improved pulmonary edema?  
 evidence of improved pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen and the
 hazy opacification at the bases, more prominent on the right, has decreased. 
 This could be consistent with improving pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis, though the appearance could merely reflect in part a more upright
 position of the patient.
 Otherwise little change.
