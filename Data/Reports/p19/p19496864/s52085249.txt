  Endotracheal tube terminates ~ 9 mm above the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by
  approximately 1.5-2 cm for more optimal positioning.
  
  Right greater than left perihilar opacities could be due to pulmonary edema
  versus aspiration, infectious process not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same
 last name!  // ETT?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximate 9 mm above the carina.  Recommend
 withdrawal by approximately 1.5-2 cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location
 of the proximal stomach.
 
 Right greater than left perihilar opacities could be due to pulmonary edema
 versus aspiration, infectious process not excluded.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen.  There is subtle suggestion of linear calcification at the right
 diaphragm which could represent pleural calcification.
