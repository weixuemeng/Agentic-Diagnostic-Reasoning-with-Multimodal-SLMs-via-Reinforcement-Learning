                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cardiac arrest , concern for rising
 temperatures. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 While the bilateral predominantly basilar diffuse opacities, right greater
 than left, may be contributed to by some vascular congestion, this is still
 worrisome for bilateral pneumonia.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 probable.
 
 The tip of the ETT is seen 5.5 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen in
 the stomach continues out of view. The tip of a right IJ catheter is seen in
 the mid to lower SVC.  The tip of an esophageal temperature probe is noted in
 the standard position.  The heart size is unchanged. No pneumothorax.  There
 is a calcified pleural plaque in the right lung base, compatible with prior
 asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral predominantly basilar diffuse opacities, right greater than left,
 while likely partially due to increasing vascular congestion and atelectasis,
 are still worrisome for bilateral pneumonia.
 2. All support devices are in standard position.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ Surgery ___ ___,
 M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 5:03 PM, 20 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
