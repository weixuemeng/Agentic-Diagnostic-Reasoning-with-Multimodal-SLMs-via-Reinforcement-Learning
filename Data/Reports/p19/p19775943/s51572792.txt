 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough x4 days.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The overall increased attenuation of the
 lung parenchyma is likely secondary to overlying soft tissues and AP
 technique.  No focal consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Bronchovascular crowding is likely secondary to the AP technique.  No overt
 pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions are identified.  There is mild
 unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Degenerative changes of the right shoulder
 are noted.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
