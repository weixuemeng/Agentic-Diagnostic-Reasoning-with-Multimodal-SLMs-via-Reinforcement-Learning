                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Not feeling well, unable to remember phone numbers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with unchanged calcified
 mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes compatible with prior granulomatous disease.
 The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  A calcified granuloma in the right upper
 lobe posteriorly is unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Streaky linear opacities in the lingula are
 unchanged, and likely reflect scarring from chronic peribronchial
 inflammation.  Spinal posterior fusion hardware within the lower lumbar spine
 is partially imaged.  A small hiatal hernia is re-demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
