                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dysphagia and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Calcified hilar lymph nodes are
 again compatible prior granulomatous disease.  Small hiatal hernia is again
 noted.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Patchy ill-defined nodular
 opacification within the region of the lingula is suggestive of small airways
 infectious or inflammatory process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Granuloma within the right lower lobe is stable.  Partially
 imaged is fusion hardware within the lumbar spine.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy ill-defined nodular opacities within the lingula is suggestive of a
 small airways infectious or inflammatory process such as aspiration.  Evidence
 of prior granulomatous disease.
