                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To evaluate for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed and compared with
 multiple prior radiographs and recent chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ill-defined opacity is seen which is appreciated only on the
 lateral view located in the posterior and lower lungs.  This is seen only on
 the lateral view.  This may be located in either of the lower lobes.  Upper
 lungs are clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  Heart size, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  Mild atherosclerotic calcification is present
 in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacity in the lower lungs appreciated on the lateral
 radiograph is concerning for focus of infection.  This is seen only on the
 lateral view and anatomically may be located in either of the lower lobes. 
 Followup radiographs is recommended in four weeks after appropriate treatment
 to assess for interval changes.
