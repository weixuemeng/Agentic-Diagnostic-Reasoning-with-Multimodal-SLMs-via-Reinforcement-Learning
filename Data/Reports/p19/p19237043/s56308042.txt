  1. Diffuse pattern of reticulonodular opacity is seen in the left mid and
  lower lung, similar to prior exam and of indeterminate etiology. Recommend
  clinical correlation.  Nonemergent CT could be performed for further
  evaluation, if clinically indicated.
  
  2.  Linear opacity in the right lung base, likely representing atelectasis.
  
  3.  No acute fracture is seen, however if clinical concern for rib fracture
  persists, dedicated films could be obtained.

  Linear opacity in the right lung base, likely representing platelike
  atelectasis but cannot completely exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the
  clinical setting.  No acute fracture is seen, however if clinical concern for
  rib fracture persists, dedicated films could be obtained.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with right rib pain and dyspnea s/p fall  // r/o acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Suture projecting overlying the left chest
 suggests a prior resection. There is linear opacity at the right lung base
 likely representing atelectasis.  Diffuse pattern of reticulonodular opacity
 is seen in the left mid and lower lung, similar to prior exam and of
 indeterminate etiology.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastial silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute fracture
 is seen.  Cervical spinal hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse pattern of reticulonodular opacity is seen in the left mid and
 lower lung, similar to prior exam and of indeterminate etiology.  Recommend
 clinical correlation.  Nonemergent CT could be performed for further
 evaluation, if clinically indicated.
 
 2.  Linear opacity in the right lung base, likely representing atelectasis.
 
 3.  No acute fracture is seen, however if clinical concern for rib fracture
 persists, dedicated films could be obtained.
