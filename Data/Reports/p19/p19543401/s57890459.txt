                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient positioning and exclusion of the
 left costophrenic angle. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm
 from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, with
 tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Cardiac silhouette size appears
 mildly enlarged. Multiple clips are noted projecting over the left lower hemi
 thorax. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is likely present. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas
 of atelectasis. Infection or aspiration is not excluded. There may be small
 bilateral pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is identified, though
 assessment is limited on this single supine view. No acutely displaced
 fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Standard position of the endotracheal and enteric tubes. 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis though aspiration or infection is not
 excluded.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
