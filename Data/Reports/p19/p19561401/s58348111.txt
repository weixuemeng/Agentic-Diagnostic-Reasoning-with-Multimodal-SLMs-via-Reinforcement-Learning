 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no acute process.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  There is loss
 structure in the right upper lobe, potentially reflecting pulmonary emphysema.
 CT would be the more sensitive technique to confirm this change.
