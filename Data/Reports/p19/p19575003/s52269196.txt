                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Assault. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear
 without focal opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  There is calcification of the left aortic knob.  Old left posterior
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Conventional chest radiographs
 are not sensitive for detecting subtle chest wall trauma. If there are focal
 findings, dedidcated views of those areas are recommended.
