                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 The lower hemithoraces were not included on the film.  Within this limitation,
 left retrocardiac opacity has worsened consistent with worsening atelectasis. 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia is unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 probably stable.  ET tube is in standard position.  The tip is 5.7 cm above
 the carina.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
