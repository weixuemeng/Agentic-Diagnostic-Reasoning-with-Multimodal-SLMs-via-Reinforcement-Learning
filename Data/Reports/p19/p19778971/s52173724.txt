 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has an
 unchanged nasogastric tube.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, accompanied by parenchymal
 opacities, most likely atelectatic in origin, but coexisting pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged
 moderate tortuosity of the calcified thoracic aorta.
