                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post pigtail placement for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 pigtail drainage catheter has been placed in the lower left pleural space. 
 The large majority of a loculated pleural effusion has been drained with a
 moderate residual quantity and parenchymal opacity which can probably be
 attributable to atelectasis, although an infectious etiology is not excluded
 by this study.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  A small pleural effusion
 on the right is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in left pleural effusion following placement
 of catheter.
