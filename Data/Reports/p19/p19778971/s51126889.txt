                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube for drainage of complicated effusion and small
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Chest tubes remain in position.  There is better aeration of the left
 hemithorax, though extensive bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist. 
 Although not well seen, there probably is continued small apical pneumothorax
 on the left.
