                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  COUGH
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  Marked hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening
 hemidiaphragms is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. 
 Mild streaks of atelectasis are suggested at the right base laterally.
