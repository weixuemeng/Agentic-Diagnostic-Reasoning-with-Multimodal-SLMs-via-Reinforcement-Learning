                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 TECHNOLOGIST'S NOTE:  "No ET tube in place.  Radiograph needed to assess
 interval change."
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Compared with ___ at 5:35 a.m., the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is more pronounced focal
 opacity in the right midzone, in the perihilar area.  This may reflect the
 presence of atelectasis, but an early infiltrate is in the differential. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the left base peripherally, with increased retrocardiac
 density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Suspect small amount of fluid at the right costophrenic angle, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) More pronounced focal opacity in the right perihilar region -- ?
 atelectasis or early pneumonic infiltrate.  Otherwise, no significant change. 
 
 
 2) As noted, no ET tube is in place.
