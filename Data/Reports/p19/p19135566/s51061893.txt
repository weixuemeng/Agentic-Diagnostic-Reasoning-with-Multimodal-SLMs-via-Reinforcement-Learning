 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent hip fracture, progressive hypoxia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now evidence of
 bilateral pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis at both lung
 bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has moderately increased.  There is
 no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  The course of the nasogastric tube is
 unremarkable, overinflation of the stomach is present in unchanged manner.  A
 nasogastric tube is in situ.
