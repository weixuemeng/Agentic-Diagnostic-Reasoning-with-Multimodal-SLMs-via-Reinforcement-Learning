 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, preoperative chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Normal lung volumes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. 
 No pleural effusions.  Slight deviation of the trachea to the left and
 increased upper mediastinal density to the right may suggest the presence of a
 thyroid nodule with extensive effect.  No pneumothorax.
