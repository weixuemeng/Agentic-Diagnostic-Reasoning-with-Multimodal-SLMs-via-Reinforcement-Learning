                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs appear slightly heterogeneous
 bilaterally, probably corresponding to subsequently diagnosed multifocal
 ground glass opacities on CTA of the chest performed less than two hours
 later.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
