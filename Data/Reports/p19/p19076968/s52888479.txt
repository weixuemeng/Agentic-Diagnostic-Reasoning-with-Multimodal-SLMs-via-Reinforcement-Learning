                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits, and lungs are
 clear except for a localized patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region,
 which may be due to focal atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely an early
 focus of pneumonia.  Minimal linear atelectasis is noted in the left lower
 lobe.
