                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset shortness of breath with no exam findings.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia, COPD, or evidence of volume overload or sarcoid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs with no
 increased interstitial markings to suggest pulmonary edema.  The hila are
 abnormal and do not suggest lymph node enlargement.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Again noted is a rounded density at the left
 lateral aspect of the diaphragm which may be in the breast tissue. Correlation
 with physical exam is recommended. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of pneumonia, COPD, sarcoid, or volume overload.
 
 2. Incidentally noted focal rounded density in the area of the left lateral
 hemidiaphragm, which may be in the breast tissue. Correlation with clinical
 exam is recommended.
