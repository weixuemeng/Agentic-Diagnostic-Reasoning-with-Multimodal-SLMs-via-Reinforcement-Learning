                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness and syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A nodular opacity projecting over the
 left lower lung suggests a nipple shadow rather than a true pulmonary nodule.
 Vague opacity is noted in the basilar right lower lobe in both views.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Vague right lower lobe opacity, probably atelectasis, although pneumonia
 is not excluded.
 
 2.  Vague nodular focus projecting over the left lower lung, probably a nipple
 shadow, with a pulmonary nodule less likely.
 
 An additional PA view with nipple markers is recommended to assess further.
