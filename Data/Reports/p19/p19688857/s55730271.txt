                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachy afib 155, r/o infection  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The linear opacities seen in the
 right base likely represent atelectasis.  No definite consolidation is
 identified.  Given density of breasts, however, evaluation of lung bases is
 limited.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  If there is persistent concern for
 pneumonia, conventional PA and lateral radiographs can be obtained for better
 evaluation of the lung bases, suboptimally assessed on this single portable
 projection in the setting of dense overlying breast tissue.
