 COPD with worsening hypoxia  // evaluation for edema, effusion, hemorrhage,

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There are hazy
 opacities at the lung bases which may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or
 developing infiltrates.  There is mild prominence of the pulmonary
 interstitial markings however the vascular pedicle is not widened; therefore,
 pulmonary edema is felt less likely. There are no pneumothoraces.
