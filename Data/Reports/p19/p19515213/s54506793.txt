                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Given this, there is
 subtle patchy left base retrocardiac opacity, best seen on the frontal view,
 which could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation due to
 aspiration and/or pneumonia is not excluded.  There is minimal elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarge.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are seen at the right shoulder, the
 right humeral head is high-riding, which can be seen in rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm. 
 Subtle patchy left base opacity could be due to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation due to aspiration or pneumonia may be present.
