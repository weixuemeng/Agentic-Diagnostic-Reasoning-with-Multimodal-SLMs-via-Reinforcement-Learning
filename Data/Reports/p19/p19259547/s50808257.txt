                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post sigmoid colectomy presents
 with crackles at the bases, evaluate for fluid.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities are present. 
 Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates
 are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures grossly within normal limits.  Moderately gas-distended large bowel
 loops are noted, elevating mildly the left-sided hemidiaphragms but again no
 pulmonary abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest findings within normal limits.  Question for fluid is
 interpreted as ruling out pulmonary congestion or edema.  If not, specify
 question.
