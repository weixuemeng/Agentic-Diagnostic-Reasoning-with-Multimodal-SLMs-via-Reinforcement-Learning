 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, intubation, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in constant position.  The patient is strongly relocated, which
 limits the evaluation of subtle changes.  However, there appears to be a
 slight increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing diffuse parenchymal
 opacities.  Moreover, blunting of the costophrenic sinuses has increased,
 potentially suggesting increasing pleural effusions.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged.
