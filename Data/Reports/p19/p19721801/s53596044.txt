 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post colectomy, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 3:26 and ___ at 3:04.
 
 A portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 4:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal
 esophagus, but the tip cannot be identified, but is felt to likely be below
 the diaphragm.  There are layering bilateral effusions.  The heart remains
 stably enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial
 effusion should also be considered.  There is stable mild pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
