                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alveolar hemorrhage post-surgically.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 left IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.  The
 other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  There is
 persistent vascular congestion with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 More focal opacification is seen at the right base.  This is consistent with
 pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, consolidation, or even
 hemorrhage.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume
 loss in the lower left lung with probable small effusion.
