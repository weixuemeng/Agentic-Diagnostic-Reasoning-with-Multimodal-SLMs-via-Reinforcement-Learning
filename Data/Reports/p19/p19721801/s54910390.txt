                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever on postop day two, question
 atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  A supine portable chest radiograph is oblique such that the heart
 obscures the right medial lung field.  There appears to be improved clarity at
 the right lung base compared to a film from much earlier the same date, which
 was semi-upright.  There is still some partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  This consolidation could be either atelectasis or pneumonia,
 though the former appears more likely.  Large cardiac silhouette is unchanged
 and positioning of supporting lines and tubes including endotracheal tube,
 right IJ central venous catheter and a right-sided midline are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Slight improved aeration at right lung base (which, however, is
 less well visualized than on the study from earlier the same date) and
 persistent hazy opacity on the left, which could be related to either
 pneumonia or atelectasis.
