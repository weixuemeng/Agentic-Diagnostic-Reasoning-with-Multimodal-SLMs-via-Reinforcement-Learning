                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post exploratory laparotomy, right
 hemicolectomy, ___ ___'s and end ileostomy.  Followup chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable semi-upright chest radiograph is slightly
 underpenetrated in technique, however, there appears to be no improvement, and
 a possible slight increase, in airspace haziness in the lower lung zones
 bilaterally.  On the right, this is obscuring the hemidiaphragm.  Positioning
 of supporting lines and tubes is unchanged, and note is made that the
 right-sided PICC line is in midline, approximately at the level of the
 cephalic vein.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Hazy bibasilar airspace consolidation, progressed from ___, but unchanged compared to two prior films on ___.
