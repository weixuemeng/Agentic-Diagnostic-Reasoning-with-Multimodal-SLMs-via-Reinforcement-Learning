                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old hemoptysis and ischemic colon, status post
 exploratory laparotomy, followup chest film.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 4:35.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 5:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are
 unchanged.  There are stable bibasilar patchy opacities with associated
 layering fluid suggestive of compressive atelectasis; however, the pulmonary
 vasculature is less well defined, consistent with worsening mild pulmonary
 edema.  Heart is stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity
 to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
