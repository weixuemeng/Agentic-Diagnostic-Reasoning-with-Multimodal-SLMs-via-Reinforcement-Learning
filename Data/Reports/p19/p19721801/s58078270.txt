                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:33 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with an increasing white count and firm and
 tender abdomen.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Perihilar consolidation persists, now more symmetric than on ___. 
 This could all be pulmonary edema given severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion, though radiographically one cannot exclude concurrent
 pneumonia.  A PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.
