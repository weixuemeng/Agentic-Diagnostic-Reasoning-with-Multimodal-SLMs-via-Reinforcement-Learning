                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Persistent pulmonary
 vascular congestion accompanied by combined alveolar and interstitial pattern
 likely due to pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible
 given the clinical history.  A more confluent area of opacity in the right
 lower lobe has slightly improved in the interval, with apparent improvement of
 adjacent right pleural effusion.  However, left retrocardiac atelectasis has
 slightly worsened with persistent adjacent small left pleural effusion.
