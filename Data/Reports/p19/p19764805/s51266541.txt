                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ afib on coumadin, CKD w/ bilateral nephrostomy tubes p/w
 generalized malaise, found to have signs of uremia (  coag-neg staph in ___
 culture bottles; likely contaminant), s/p HD via tunneled line today now
 complianing for neck pain and acute desat to 70s  // evidence of
 infection/pulm edema/pneumonthorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and Tubes: There is an new right-sided hemodialysis catheter with tip
 terminating in the distal right atrium.
 
 Lungs: Haziness overlying the right hemi thorax likely reflect presence of a
 fairly large right pleural effusion.  Diffuse vascular prominence and
 bibasilar atelectasis noted.
 
 Pleura: Large right pleural effusion, likely smaller left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Mediastinum: There is cardiomegaly and curvilinear aortic knuckle
 calcification.
 
 Bony thorax: Mild diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse prominence of lung vasculature associated with bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left and cardiomegaly reflect fluid overload and
 pulmonary edema.
 Likely bibasilar atelectasis.
