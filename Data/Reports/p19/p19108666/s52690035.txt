 HISTORY:  Congestion, cough, failure to thrive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is difficult to assess but may be mild to
 moderately enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness
 and vascular indistinctness.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right, are noted.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild gaseous distention of the colonic loops of bowel is present.  There are
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is diffuse demineralization of
 the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
