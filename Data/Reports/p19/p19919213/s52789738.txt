                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A new focal consolidation
 is seen in the anterior portion of the right upper lobe.  Linear bibasilar
 opacities, reflective of atelectasis, are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Pleural thickening and possible scarring is seen at the
 apices, also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New density at the anterior segment of the right upper lobe,
 concerning for early consolidation.  Follow-up radiographs are suggested
 within eight weeks in order to show resolution.
