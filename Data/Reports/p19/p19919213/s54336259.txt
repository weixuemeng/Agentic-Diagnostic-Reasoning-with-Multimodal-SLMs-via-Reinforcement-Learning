                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, pre-existing process in the
 right upper lobe has completely resolved.  The process is neither visible on
 the frontal nor on the lateral radiograph.  Currently, no other lung
 parenchymal changes are seen, except for minimal bilateral symmetrical pleural
 irregularities.  Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
