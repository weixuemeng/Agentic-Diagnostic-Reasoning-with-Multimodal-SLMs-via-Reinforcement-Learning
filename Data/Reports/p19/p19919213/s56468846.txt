                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with DOE, SOB evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study, mild central pulmonary vascular
 congestion with moderate associated interstitial pulmonary edema is new with
 interval increase in moderate cardiomegaly.  Underlying interstitial lung
 disease is present. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is chronic and
 likely related to pleural-parenchymal scarring rather than small effusions. 
 Biapical scarring is unchanged.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate volume overload in the setting of underlying interstitial lung
 disease. No focal consolidation.
