                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with h/o lung ca, presenting with cough and weakness
 // eval for pneumonia, other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated suggestive of COPD. Volume loss in the right lung with elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm is new compared to the prior study and compatible
 with a history of the right lower lobe wedge resection. Streaky opacities are
 seen within the right lung base which may reflect atelectasis or scarring. No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky right basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or scarring.
 Hyperinflation of the lungs suggestive of underlying COPD.
