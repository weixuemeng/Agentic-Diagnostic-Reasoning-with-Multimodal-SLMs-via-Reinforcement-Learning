 Pneumothorax is virtually cleared, though there are bands of atelectasis at
 the left lung base, which should not be mistaken for pleural edges.  Very tiny
 left pleural effusion collected posteriorly has not increased.  A left-sided
 catheter runs from the mid axillary line to the anterior chest wall.  Left
 subclavian infusion port ends in the mid SVC.  Right lung clear.  Heart size
 normal.
