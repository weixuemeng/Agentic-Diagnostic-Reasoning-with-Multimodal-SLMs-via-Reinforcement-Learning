                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  A chest tube has been placed into the left hemithorax since the
 prior study.  A central venous catheter appears unchanged.  The lung has
 mostly reexpanded with a suspected small residual pneumothorax primarily
 suggested by minimal lucency remaining at the left lung base.  There is no
 shift of midline structures.  There is patchy opacification in the left lower
 hemithorax, but suggesting atelectasis associated with a recent pneumothorax
 that has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post chest tube placement with small suspected residual
 pneumothorax.  Continued radiographic followup suggested.
