                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with influenza, pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increase in bibasilar consolidation is probably due to lower lung volumes and
 not real progression of the disease.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac contour is normal in this patient with an
 atrioventricular pacemaker.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Increase in bibasilar consolidations is probably technical due to lower lung
 volumes.  There is probably no significant change since the exam of yesterday
 in the bilateral opacities, probably related to the influenza.
