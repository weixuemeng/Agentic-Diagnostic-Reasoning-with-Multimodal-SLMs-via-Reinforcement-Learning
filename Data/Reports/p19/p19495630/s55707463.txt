                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, please evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates hyperexpansion of
 lungs with relative lucency of the upper lung zones, consistent with chronic
 lung disease.  There is a persistent asymmetric increased opacity in the right
 lung base, similar across multiple prior studies and possibly representing
 combination of scarring and atelectasis.  No new focal opacifications evident.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal. Stable positioning of
 dual-chamber pacemaker noted.  No osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Stable linear right lower lung
 opacifications, unchanged across multiple prior studies on background of
 chronic lung disease.
