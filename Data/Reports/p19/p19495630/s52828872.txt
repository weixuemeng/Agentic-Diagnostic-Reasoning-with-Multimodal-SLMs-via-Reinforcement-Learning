                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient admitted with COPD exacerbation and
 volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Comparison suggests mild regression of
 heart size and thymus, simultaneously lesser marked perivascular haze in the
 pulmonary circulation compatible with dehydration in patient previously
 suffering from fluid overload.  The previously identified local suspicious
 hazy densities in the right mid lung field and lower lobe area as well as left
 upper lobe area have all regressed and suggest improvement of the previously
 identified multifocal densities suspicious to constitute exacerbation of the
 patient's chronic COPD status.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are seen. 
 The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free as they were before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of previously diagnosed exacerbation of COPD, patient
 with multiple focal parenchymal infiltrates.  
 
 The present chest findings are similar to what was noted on a more remote
 examination of ___.
