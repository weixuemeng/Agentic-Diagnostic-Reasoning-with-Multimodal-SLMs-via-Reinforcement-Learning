                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD on home oxygen, had pneumonia in ___,
 now dyspneic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Compared to ___ there are two new regions where radiodensity in the
 lungs has changed, on the right side at the level of the third anterior rib is
 a roughly 3 cm wide geographic region, and on the lateral view, there is
 partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and a tiny volume of left
 pleural fluid.  Either of both of these regions could be pneumonia, and
 although exceedingly small, could be clinically significant, because of the
 patient's very severe emphysema.
 
 There is no evidence of cardiac decompensation.  Heart size is normal. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard
 placements.  Dr. ___ was paged at 2:15 p.m.
