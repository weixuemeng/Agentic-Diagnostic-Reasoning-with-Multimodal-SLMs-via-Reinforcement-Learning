 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The bilateral parenchymal opacities, seen in the retrocardiac lung
 areas and at the right lung bases, could have minimally increased in severity.
 The lateral radiograph also shows a minimal dorsal pleural effusion.  The
 heart continues to be normal.  Left pectoral pacemaker is in unchanged
 position.
