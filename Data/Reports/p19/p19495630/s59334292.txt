                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the areas of consolidation
 have effectively cleared.  Again, there is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and a dual-channel pacemaker device
 in place.  No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
