                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with known COPD, with worsening shortness of breath,
 cough over the past three to five days.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior studies, including most
 recent radiographs of the chest from ___, as well as CT of the
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a left chest
 wall pulse generator, with pacing wires terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle, unchanged from the prior study.
 
 The lung volumes are somewhat low, with background emphysema and interstitial
 prominence, similar compared to prior studies; however, there are new left
 perihilar opacities which are concerning for infection.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left perihilar opacities, new since the prior study are
 concerning for pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment are
 recommended.
