                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate irregular
 opacity punctuated with small lucencies possibly representing dilated bronchi.
 This could represent asymmetric edema versus infection, and could potentially
 represent entities such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.  There may also be
 additional opacities in the right middle and left infrahilar lungs.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is appearance of severe emphysema.
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  A left pectoral dual-channel pacer/AICD appears stable in
 location with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Upper thoracic lordosis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend
 treatment and followup to resolution.
