  Right basal chest tube in place with small adjacent basal pneumothorax.  Right
  pleural effusion greatly improved with small amount of fluid remaining. 
  Heterogeneous opacity of the right lower lung is likely a combination of
  loculated fluid and atelectasis.  There is minimal left base atelectasis.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracoscopy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is now after thoracoscopy, right basal chest tube is in
 place, there is a small adjacent right basolateral pneumothorax without
 evidence of tension.  The right pleural effusion is greatly improved after the
 intervention; however, a small amount of fluid remains in the pleural space. 
 A heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lung is likely a combination of
 free expansion edema and atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis is also seen at the
 left lung bases.  Unchanged mild deviation of the upper trachea to the left. 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper range of normal.
