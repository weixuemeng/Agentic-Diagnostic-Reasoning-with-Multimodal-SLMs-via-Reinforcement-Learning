                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates opacification of
 most of the right hemithorax with interval increase in right-sided pleural
 effusion, now quite large, which has significantly increased in size over the
 course of 10 days, and may be partially loculated.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  Cardiac size remains stable as does the left hilar
 contour.  There is no left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very large right-sided pleural effusion which may be partially
 loculated, increased significantly since the prior study, with underlying
 atelectasis.
