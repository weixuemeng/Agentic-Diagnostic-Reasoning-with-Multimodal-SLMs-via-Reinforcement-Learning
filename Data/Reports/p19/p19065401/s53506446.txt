 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:53 PM
  Enteric tube tip is in the gastric body/antrum. Otherwise, little change in
  comparison to the prior study with no acute cardiopulmonary process, right
  picc with tip in the mid svc, and two-lead pacemaker in place.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:23 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with catatonia.  Evaluate GI drainage tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Upper enteric tube ends in the region of the pylorus, in a completely
 decompressed stomach.  The transverse colon in both flexures are filled with
 stool.  There is no pneumoperitoneum.
 
 Lungs are clear, cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces
 unremarkable.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is new, probably explained
 by a subphrenic process.  A section of tubing, roughly 4 cm long, projects
 over the right heart on chest radiographs since ___, presumably
 a long coronary stent.  Unfortunately, the lateral view on ___, does
 not show it, so I cannot localize it, but unless its identity is known to the
 clinical service, it needs to be investigated with imaging to exclude a
 retained catheter fragment in the right atrium.  Fluoroscopy would be the
 easiest. A right PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC and a transvenous
 right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their courses,
 unchanged.
 
 I discussed the findings at length by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9AM.
