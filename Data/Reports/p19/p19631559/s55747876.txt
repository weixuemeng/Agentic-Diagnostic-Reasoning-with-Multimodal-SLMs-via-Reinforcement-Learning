 Assess fluid status, infiltrates, interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Again there are low lung volumes with enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, and bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis.  Given these pulmonary
 changes, it would be extremely difficult to exclude the possibility of
 superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
