                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCAP, CHF, severe sepsis, intubated  //
 Interval change, infiltrate, volume status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are lower, accentuating
 cardiomediastinal contours and bronchovascular structures.  Within this
 context, interval worsening of bibasilar opacities is probably due to
 atelectasis although aspiration is an additional consideration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
