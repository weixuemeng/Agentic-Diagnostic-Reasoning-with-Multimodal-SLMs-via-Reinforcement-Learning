                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary septic shock  // Infiltrate,
 pulmonary edema      Infiltrate, pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter is been
 removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Continued low
 lung volumes accentuates the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again suggests elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be very
 difficult to assess, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
