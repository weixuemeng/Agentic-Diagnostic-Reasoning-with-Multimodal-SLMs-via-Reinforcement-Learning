 chest without contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is similar in appearance to prior study and may represent
 atelectasis.  There is mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature which may be
 due to mild pulmonary edema or due to technique.  Nodular opacity in the left
