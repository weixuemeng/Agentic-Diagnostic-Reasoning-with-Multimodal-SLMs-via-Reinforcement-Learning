                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with shortness of breath.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient is rotated, which precludes precise assessment of the mediastinum,
 but no gross abnormality demonstrated.  Minimal vascular engorgement cannot be
 excluded.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
