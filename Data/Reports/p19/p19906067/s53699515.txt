 are otherwise unremarkable and there is no pulmonary edema.  As before,
 multiple calcified granulomas are seen within the left upper lobe, and there
 is calcification of the pleura posteriorly within the left hemithorax
 compatible with fibrothorax.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is status post right mastectomy with a clip
 demonstrated in the right chest wall.  There are multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine including a mild compression deformity at the
 thoracolumbar junction, unchanged.
