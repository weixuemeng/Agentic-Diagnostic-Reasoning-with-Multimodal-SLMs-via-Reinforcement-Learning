                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Basilar crackles.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is increased opacification of the left base, although only well depicted
 on the frontal view.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Calcified pleural plaques are present.  A surgical clip projects over the
 right anterolateral chest wall.  Bony demineralization and degenerative
 changes along the thoracolumbar spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia without findings
 that would suggest pulmonary edema.
