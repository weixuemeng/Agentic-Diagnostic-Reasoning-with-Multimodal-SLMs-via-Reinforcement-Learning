                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Diastolic heart failure.  Basal crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lung is clear.  Leftward mediastinal
 shift is probably due to pleural restriction from chronic calcific pleuritis,
 best seen on the lateral view, and reflected in chronic left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  No findings to suggest acute infection or cardiac
 decompensation, although moderate cardiomegaly including left atrial
 enlargement are both chronic.
