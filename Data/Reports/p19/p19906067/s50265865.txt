                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ Chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The aorta remains mildly
 tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications of the knob.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Cluster of punctate calcifications within the left
 lung apex is compatible with prior  granulomatous disease.  Streaky opacity
 within the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  Small hiatal hernia is
 re- demonstrated.  No new focal consolidation is present.  Clip overlies the
 right lateral chest wall, and the patient is status post right mastectomy. 
 Pleural calcification is again seen within the left posterobasal hemithorax
 compatible with prior fibrothorax.  Previously seen left lower lobe nodule on
 CT is not clearly visualized on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Small hiatal hernia.
