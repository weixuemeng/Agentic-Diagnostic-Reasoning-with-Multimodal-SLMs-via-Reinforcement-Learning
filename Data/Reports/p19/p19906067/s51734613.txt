                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall with left shoulder pain, assess traumatic
 injury to the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  As better
 assessed on the dedicated left shoulder radiograph, there is an acute fracture
 involving the neck of the left humerus.  No definite displaced left rib
 fractures are seen.  Leftward rotation does limit the evaluation through the
 chest, though there is no large consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax
 identified within the chest.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 stable.  No large pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left humeral neck fracture.  Otherwise, no acute injury seen.
