                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Follow up pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the loculated left lower pneumothorax with pigtail
 catheter in place.  There is an air-fluid level compatible with a
 hydropneumothorax with the effusion layering posterior to the lung.  The right
 lung is clear.  Compared to the prior study, the pneumothorax is of similar
 size.
