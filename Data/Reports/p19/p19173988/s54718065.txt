                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small loculated left basal and lateral pneumothorax is slightly smaller than
 on ___.  There is no fluid pooling in the pleural space, where the
 pigtail pleural drain rests.  Marked pleural thickening is noted and probably
 explains failure of the left lung to fill the hemithorax.  This is also
 reflected in extensive atelectasis in the left mid and lower lung.  The right
 lung is clear.  The heart is normal size.
