                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and metastases.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Large left-sided pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the prior
 studies.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and the left heart border from
 collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula is seen, and shift of mediastinum
 to the left is more prominent. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Right lung appears well expanded and clear without focal consolidation.  There
 is no right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased large left-sided pleural effusion and left lung collapse.  An
 underlying consolidation masked by the effusion and atelectasis cannot be
 excluded.
