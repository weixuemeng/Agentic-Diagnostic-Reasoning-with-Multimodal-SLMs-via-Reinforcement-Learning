                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with persistent air leak
 after thoracotomy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the
 same day earlier at 2:25 p.m.
 
 The pigtail catheter is in place.  There is still present partially loculated
 basal pneumothorax that appears to be minimally decreased since the prior
 study.  The left basal atelectasis is unchanged and rest of the findings
 appear to be stable since the prior study.  Small amount of pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded in the right pleural space.
