                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left pleural effusion, trapped lung after
 thoracocentesis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 After insertion of the pigtail catheter, there is substantial interval
 decrease in left pleural effusion and currently moderate loculated basal
 pneumothorax is seen.  Rest of the findings are unchanged.
