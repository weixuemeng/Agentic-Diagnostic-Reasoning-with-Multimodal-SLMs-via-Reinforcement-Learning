                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The small persistent left pleural space, air-filled, at the base and lateral
 aspect of the left hemithorax is smaller today than on ___, and the
 basal pleural pigtail catheter unchanged in position.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.  The visceral pleura looks quite thick, which might explain
 failure of the lung to fill the pleural space.  Right lung is clear.  Heart
 size is normal.
