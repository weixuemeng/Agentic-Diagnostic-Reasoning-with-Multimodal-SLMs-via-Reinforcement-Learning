                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain after falling.  Evaluation for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, including
 most recent from ___, dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or focal airspace consolidation. Minimal
 linear atelectasis is present in the left lung base.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  No displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of displaced rib fracture.  If clinical
 concern remains for radiographically occult fracture, dedicated rib series
 radiographs or CT of the chest is recommended.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
