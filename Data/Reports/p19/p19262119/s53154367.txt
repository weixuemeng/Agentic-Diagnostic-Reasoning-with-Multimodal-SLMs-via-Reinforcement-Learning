                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is slight unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There are multiple nodular opacities in each lung, the most
 prominent of which projects over the left mid-to-upper lung with a rounded
 contour.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings suggestive of congestive heart failure, but multiple
 nodular opacities, worrisome for malignancy, although other etiologies could
 be considered.  Correlation with clinical history and chest CT are suggested
 if the etiology for these is unknown.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___
 at 1:10 am by telephone on ___.
