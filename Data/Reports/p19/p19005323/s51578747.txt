 Endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter nasogastric tube are in standard
 position.  Mild widening of cardiomediastinal contours compared to the
 preoperative radiograph of 1 day earlier is likely due to accentuation by
 portable supine technique and low lung volumes.  Lungs are clear except for
 minor bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
