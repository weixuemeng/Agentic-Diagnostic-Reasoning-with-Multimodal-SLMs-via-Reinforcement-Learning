                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // ?tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube terminating
 approximately 3.7 cm from the chronic. An enteric tube tip and side-port
 terminates within the stomach.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Ill-defined small nodular opacities are
 demonstrated within both lung bases. Hazy opacity within the left hemi thorax
 suggest a layering pleural effusion. No large pneumothorax is identified.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Bibasilar ill-defined small nodular opacities, worrisome for infection or
 aspiration.  Metastatic disease is not excluded.
 3. Hazy opacity in the left hemi thorax, likely a layering left pleural
 effusion.
