                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Left lower lobe opacity is severe.  There is mild-to-moderate right fissural
 fluid.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace interstitial
 edema.  Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe is likely due to a combination of
 edema and atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is similar to prior. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Right arm stent and IVC stent are
 partially evaluated.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusion is most likely moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Severe left lower lobe opacity could be due to atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.
 2. Right lower lobe hazy opacity is likely due to a combination of edema and
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection could be present.
 3. Trace interstitial edema.
 4. Bilateral pleural effusions, most likely moderate.
