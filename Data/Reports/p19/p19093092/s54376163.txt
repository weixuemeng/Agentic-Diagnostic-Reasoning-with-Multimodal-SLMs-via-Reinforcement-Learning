 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal, the mediastinal contours are normal.  Incidental note is made of a
 stent graft within the right arm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature in the setting of
 low lung volumes, without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
