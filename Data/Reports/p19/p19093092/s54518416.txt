                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ESRD missed HD yesterday now has facial edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vascularity within the right lung is a more pronounced compared to
 the left, findings which could suggest mild asymmetric pulmonary edema. Patchy
 opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis. Minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion, and there is
 minimal fluid seen in the right minor fissure. No large left pleural effusion
 is seen, but the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
 There is no pneumothorax. Vascular stent is noted in the right the
 brachial/axillary region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace right pleural effusion and possible asymmetric mild pulmonary edema.
 Patchy right basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis. Infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
