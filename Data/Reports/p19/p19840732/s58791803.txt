                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia. 
 Interval monitoring.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is worsening opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure.
 Left lower lobe opacification is also worsened.  There is a background of
 developing mild pulmonary edema bilaterally.  Small left pleural effusion is
 slightly larger.  Mild cardiomegaly is not appreciably changed.  Right central
 venous catheter terminates in the mid to low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening opacities in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe suggest
 multifocal pneumonia
 2. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is developing mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Probable small left pleural effusion is slightly larger.
