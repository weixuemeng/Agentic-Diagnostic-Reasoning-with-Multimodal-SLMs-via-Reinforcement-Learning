                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Streaky linear left basilar opacities extend to the
 hilum and likely represent atelectasis.  The right lung demonstrates linear
 right basilar atelectasis and is otherwise grossly clear.  There is no right
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged from the prior several
 examinations.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Waxing and waning left lower lobe airspace opacity which demonstrates a
 morphological appearance suggestive of atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection or aspiration is difficult to exclude.
