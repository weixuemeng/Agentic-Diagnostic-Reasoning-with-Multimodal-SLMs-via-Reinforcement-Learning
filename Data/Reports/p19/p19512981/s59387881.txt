                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left rib pain after mechanical fall  // please
 evaluate for acute cp process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lung is essentially clear.  Slightly increased density along the
 periphery and base of the left lung is likely due to the pleural-based
 hematoma seen on the concurrent chest CT.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  Acute fractures of the left
 fifth through ninth ribs are displaced.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density over the periphery and base of the left lung is likely due
 to the pleural or extrapleural hematoma resulting from multiple left-sided rib
 fractures.
