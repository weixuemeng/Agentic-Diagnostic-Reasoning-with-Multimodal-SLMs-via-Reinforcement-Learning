 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  Enteric tube is present
 5.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube is noted, but sideholes are near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well
 expanded and clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Advancement of enteric tube by several centimeters is recommended to
 ensure positioning of sideholes in the stomach.
