                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, intubated at OSH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube terminates in the
 stomach with the side hole at the level of the diaphragm.  Diffuse hazy
 opacities are seen throughout the lungs bilaterally. More focal consolidative
 opacities are seen adjacent to the right hilum and in the left upper lung
 laterally.  Findings may represent moderate to severe pulmonary edema, but
 cannot exclude an underlying pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical
 setting.  No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 partially obscured by the adjacent opacities but may be slightly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carinal.
 
 2.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, potentially moderate to severe pulmonary
 edema, ARDS or diffuse infection.
