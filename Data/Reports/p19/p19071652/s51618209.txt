                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, hypertensive urgency, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased and there is a decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities, predominantly at the lung bases.  These changes are
 likely to reflect improvement in pulmonary edema.  Remnant changes, however,
 are still seen at the bases of the left and right lung.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  No evidence of larger pleural effusions.
