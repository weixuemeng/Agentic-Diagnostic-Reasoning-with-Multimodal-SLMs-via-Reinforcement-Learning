                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous surgery in the left lung with clips just
 below the left main bronchus, unchanged in appearance.  Associated mild volume
 loss in left hemithorax appears stable.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Lungs are clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-operative appearance of the chest with no findings of
 disease recurrence.  However, CT would be more sensitive for detecting
 recurrent disease and may be considered if there is strong clinical suspicion.
