                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear with
 minimal linear opacity in the left lower lung that may be related to
 positioning and inspiration, but developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  If clinically warranted,
 correlation with chest CT might be considered.
