                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening lung exam and increasing oxygen requirement, assess for
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Left basal
 opacity is unchanged with increasing right basal opacity.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions are increased.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is
 unchanged or slightly increased.  Left PICC is in unchanged position.  Heart
 and mediastinal contours reveal stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right basal opacity is concerning for aspiration given
 the provided clinical history with bilateral increased small pleural effusions
 and unchanged or slightly increased mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Unchanged left basal opacity, likely atelectasis.
