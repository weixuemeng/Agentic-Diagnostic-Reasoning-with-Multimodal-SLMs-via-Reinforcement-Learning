 FINDINGS:
 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Left basilar retrocardiac
 patchy opacity may be due to atelectasis however, consolidation due to
 infection or aspiration is not entirely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There has been interval decrease in right basilar opacity and pulmonary edema
 since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may
 be due to atelectasis, however consolidation due to infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.
 
 Significant interval decrease in right basilar opacity and in previously seen
 pulmonary edema.
