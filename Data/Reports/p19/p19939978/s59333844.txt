                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and congestion on immunosuppression. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left basilar retrocardiac opacity which obscures the left heart
 border.  This may reflect atelectasis, though a consolidation due to infection
 or aspiration is not excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Cervical spinal
 fusion hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left heart border may reflect
 atelectasis, though consolidation cannot be excluded.
