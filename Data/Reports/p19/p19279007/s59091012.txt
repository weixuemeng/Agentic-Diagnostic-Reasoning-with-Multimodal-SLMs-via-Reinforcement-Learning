 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph.  , no relevant change is seen. The
 current radiograph is rotated, which causes increased radiodensity at the
 right lung bases.  To reliably exclude a pathologic process in this area,
 however, a standing frontal a lateral radiograph would be helpful.  No
 cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.
