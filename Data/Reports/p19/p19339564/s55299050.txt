 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New bilateral pleural effusions, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Increased lung volumes likely reflect improved ventilation.  However,
 bilateral pleural effusions persist, and there is mild cardiomegaly.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
