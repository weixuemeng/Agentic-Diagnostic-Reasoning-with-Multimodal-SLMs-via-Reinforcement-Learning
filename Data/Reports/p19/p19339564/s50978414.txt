                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulseless left foot, preoperative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 unchanged from prior study.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Right lung base
 atelectasis and small right greater than left pleural effusion is improved
 compared to prior study.  The lungs are hyperinflated with relatively lucent
 lung fields, compatible with emphysema.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving right lung base atelectasis with small bilateral right greater
 than left effusions.
 2.  Severe emphysema.
