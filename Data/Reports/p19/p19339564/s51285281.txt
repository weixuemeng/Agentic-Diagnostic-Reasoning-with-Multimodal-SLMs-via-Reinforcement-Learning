                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  pulseless left leg.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms with an increased AP diameter
 consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged.  Left apical calcification seen.  Bibasilar chronic
 atelectasis/scarring.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Multiple compression deformities in the thoracic spine are again
 seen, grossly stable, but not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
