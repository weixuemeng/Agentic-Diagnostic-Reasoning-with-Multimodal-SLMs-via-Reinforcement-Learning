                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with two weeks of cough, travel to
 ___ (___) six months ago.  Evaluate for possible infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.
 
 A marked right-sided convex scoliosis in the mid portion of the thoracic spine
 accounts for asymmetric presentation of the chest on the frontal view. The
 degree of scoliosis is unchanged since ___.  The heart size remains normal as
 well as the thoracic aorta which follows the scoliotic curvature in its
 descending portion remains within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are found
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  With the exception of the described
 scoliosis which includes mild degenerative changes mostly in the mid portion
 of the thoracic spine, no other gross skeletal abnormalities can be
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates in this female patient with history
 of two weeks of cough.
