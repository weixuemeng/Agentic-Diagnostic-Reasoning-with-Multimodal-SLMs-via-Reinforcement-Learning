                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stroke. Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, exaggerating the cardiomediastinal contours, however
 note is made of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There has been an
 interval development of mild pulmonary edema.  The heart size is normal. 
 Interval improvement in the consolidation at the left lung base, compared to
 the exam performed 3 hr prior, is suggestive of atelectasis, however an
 infectious component may be persistent.  There is no pleural effusion. There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Interval improvement in the consolidation of the left lung base, compared
 to the radiograph performed 3 hr prior, is suggestive of atelectasis, however
 given the mild persistent opacity at the left lung base, an acute infectious
 process cannot be excluded.
