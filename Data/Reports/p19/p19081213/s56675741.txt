                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with candidemia and pulmonary infiltrates //
 interval change for increased O2 requirement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary opacities, right worse than left. Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the diffuse parenchymal abnormality. The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are obscured by the diffuse interstitial opacities
 bilaterally. The pulmonary vasculature is congested. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Aortic arch calcifications are again seen.
 
 Lines and tubes:
 Allowing for differences in patient positioning, ET tube tip is approximately
 1.2 cm above the carina and the right IJ venous line is approximately at the
 CA junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable pneumonia and concern for ARDS.
 2. Pulmonary edema.
