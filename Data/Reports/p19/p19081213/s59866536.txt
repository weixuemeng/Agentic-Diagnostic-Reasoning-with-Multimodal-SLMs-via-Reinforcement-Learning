 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure  //
 Please eval NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  Several prior studies dating back to ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Gradual increase in the right upper and mid lung consolidation is demonstrated
 in conjunction with still persistent diffuse interstitial opacity. The
 findings are concerning for interval development of a right lung pneumonia
 potentially in combination with existing interstitial pulmonary edema.
 Parenchymal hemorrhage is a possibility although slightly less likely.  Right
 internal jugular line tip can be at the cavoatrial junction.
