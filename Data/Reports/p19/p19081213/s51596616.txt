                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal pneumonia, candidemia,
 intubated, now c/f aspiration.  // Any interval improvement in pneumonia?
 evidence of aspiration?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein
 catheter was removed.  The patient is severely rotated, with resulting limited
 technical quality of the radiograph. However, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette and the very extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities appear to be
 unchanged.
