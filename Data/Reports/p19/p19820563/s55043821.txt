                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post swallowed fish bone.  Evaluate for foreign body.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The airways appear patent without evidence of radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No radiopaque
 foreign body detected, but cartilaginous fish bones are generally not
 radioopaque. There are no indirect signs of a retained bone, but if clinical
 findings warrant, contrast swallow would be required.
