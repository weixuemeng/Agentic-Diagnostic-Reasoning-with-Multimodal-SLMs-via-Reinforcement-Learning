                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left sided chest pain  // r/o pneumothorax     
 r/o pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is prominence of the aortic knob with mild calcification. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. 
 Lungs are well expanded.  Note is made of increased retrocardiac opacity and
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  There is no significant pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion in this single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumothorax in this single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 2.  Patchy left Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis versus
 aspiration.  If clinical concern, dedicated chest radiograph with a lateral
 view can be considered for more complete evaluation and to help exclude the
 possibility of a developing infectious pneumonia at this site.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 12:28 PM.
