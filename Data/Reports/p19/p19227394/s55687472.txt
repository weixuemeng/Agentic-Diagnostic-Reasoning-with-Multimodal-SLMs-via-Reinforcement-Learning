                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison except for CT abdomen from ___ (outside
 study).
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is
 noted, most likely associated with elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Rest of the
 lungs are essentially clear with additional potential atelectasis present at
 the left mid lung.  Pulmonary nodule is in differential diagnosis.  Assessment
 with lateral and oblique views is recommended.
 
 There is also a substantial right mediastinal shift of the upper trachea that
 might be associated with thyroid enlargement and correlation with thyroid
 ultrasound is required.
