                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post esophagectomy, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 There is a small right pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Right chest tube is in place.  Right subcutaneous emphysema has
 improved.  Improving opacities in the right lower lobe are due to decrease in
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Moderate left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis has also improved.
