 pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated
 with associated bibasilar opacities possibly reflecting atelectasis.  Left
 PICC tip remains in unchanged position, terminating in the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cervical spinal fusion
 hardware is partially imaged.
