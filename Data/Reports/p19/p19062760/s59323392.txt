                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles on exam.  Evaluate for consolidation, or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large bilateral pleural effusions have slightly decreased in size
 since ___.  The left lower lobe remains collapsed.  A left-sided PICC
 line terminates in the low SVC.  No new airspace opacities are detected. 
 There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion, but no frank pulmonary
 edema.  The heart is top normal in size.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight decrease or redistribution of large bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Persistent atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
 3.  No new airspace opacity to suggest infection, although lung bases are
 obscured, and no pulmonary edema.
