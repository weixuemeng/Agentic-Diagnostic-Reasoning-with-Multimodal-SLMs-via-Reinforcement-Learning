 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  P and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe may
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle on the lateral view suggests a trace pleural effusion.
 No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis versus scarring in the left lower lobe.  Trace left
 pleural effusion.
