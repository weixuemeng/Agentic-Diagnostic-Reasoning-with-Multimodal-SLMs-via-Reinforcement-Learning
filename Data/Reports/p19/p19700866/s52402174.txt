                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent ANCA vasculitis
 at outside hospital and improving oxygen requirement with increasing bibasilar
 crackles.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is within normal limits.  Assessment of
 the lung parenchyma demonstrates low lung volumes in combination with
 bilateral diffuse predominantly basal, but also apical diffuse reticular and
 potentially reticular nodular opacities with some peripheral predominance. 
 Overall, the findings are concerning for interstitial lung disease.  It
 potentially can be related to described history of vasculitis, but additional
 possibilities of interstitial pneumonia should be reviewed as well. 
 Comparison with prior outside study is required for reassessment of the
 patient with a new chest CT.
 
 Of note is that the right lung base opacities are slightly more confluent than
 the rest of the lungs and superimposed infectious process in this location
 cannot be excluded.
