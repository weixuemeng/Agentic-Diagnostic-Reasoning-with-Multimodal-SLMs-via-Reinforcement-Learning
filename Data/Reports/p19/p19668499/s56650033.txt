                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is limited by obliqued patient
 position.  Within this limitation, the cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Increased density projecting over the right hilus likely
 reflects a pulmonary vessel, though this could be further evaluated with
 properly positioned frontal and lateral chest radiographs.  Save minimal
 atelectatic changes in the lung bases, lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No finding concerning for pneumonia.  Increased density
 projecting over right hilum likely reflects pulmonary vessel exaggerated by
 oblique patient position.  Could be further evaluated with conventional
 frontal and lateral chest radiographs when clinically stable.
