 INDICATION:  History: ___F with bradycardia , status post temp pacing wire
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:30

 There has been interval placement of a temporary pacing lead terminating in
 the region of the right ventricle via a right internal jugular approach.  No
 pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain low.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists.  The aorta is markedly tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear retrocardiac opacity persists,
 likely atelectasis, without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
