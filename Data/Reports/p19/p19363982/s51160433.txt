                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cardiogenic shock  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Relatively low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of
 the bronchovascular markings.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 left basilar opacity is most likely atelectasis.  Prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given low lung volumes.
