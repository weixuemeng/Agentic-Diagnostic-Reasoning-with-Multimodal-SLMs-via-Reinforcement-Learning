 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post open cholecystectomy and partial
 duodenectomy, now with productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  There is new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  New plate-like
 atelectasis at the right lung base is likely secondary to the newly elevated
 right hemidiaphragm.  An old right-sided ninth rib fracture is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Contrast is
 seen in the transverse and proximal descending colon with multiple diverticula
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Plate-like atelectasis at the right lung base likely secondary to
 newly elevated right hemidiaphragm.
