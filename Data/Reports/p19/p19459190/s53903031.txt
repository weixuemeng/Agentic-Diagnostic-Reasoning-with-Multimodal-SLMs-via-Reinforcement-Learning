                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___/M POD#2 from right TKR with rising WBC.  // Rule out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No infiltrate is seen on the frontal
 film. However on the lateral images there is a streaky area of increased
 opacity seen inferiorly. It is unclear if this represents a small area of
 volume loss. Is not confirmed on the frontal film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Volume loss versus small infiltrate only seen on the lateral film
