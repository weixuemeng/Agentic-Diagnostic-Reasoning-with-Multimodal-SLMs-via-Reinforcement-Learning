                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with mvc rib pain thoracic pain  // r/o rib
 fractures t spiner ractures      r/o rib fractures t spiner ractures
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
  Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 and pleural surfaces are normal.  .
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
