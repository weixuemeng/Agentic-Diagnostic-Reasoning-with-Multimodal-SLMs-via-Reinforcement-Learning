                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable semi- right hip
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is intubated.  Endotracheal tube terminates about 5 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach where it makes a single
 coil.  Aorta is moderately tortuous and mildly calcified.  Heart is normal in
 size.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  I density at the medial
 right lung apex, also medial to the anterior right first rib is indeterminate.
 Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indeterminate small opacity at the right lung apex, possibly scarring or
 atelectasis, but a nodule is not excluded.  No definite evidence of acute
 disease.  Repeat radiographs are recommended when clinically appropriate in
 order to ascertain whether a possible right upper lobe opacity may persistent
 investigate further if warranted.
