 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with bilateral

 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 The patient is after T8 cage and T5-___ posterior fusion.  The appearance of
 the hardware is unchanged as compared to prior chest radiograph.  Heart size

 studies and might reflect area of atelectasis versus infectious process. 
 Attention on subsequent radiographs recommended.
