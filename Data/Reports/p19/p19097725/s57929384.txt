                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain and possible cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes that probably account for the increase in prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  Streaks of atelectasis or scarring are again seen at
 both bases.  There is no definite evidence of acute focal pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.
