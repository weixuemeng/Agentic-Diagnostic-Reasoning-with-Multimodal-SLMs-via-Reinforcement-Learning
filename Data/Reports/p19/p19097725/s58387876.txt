                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:02 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with Crohn's disease.  Please confirm PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Tip of the right PIC line projects over the low SVC.  In addition to clearly
 linear subsegmental atelectasis or scarring at the right base and some on the
 left, there is an almost nodular abnormality in the left lower lung laterally.
 This could be more atelectasis, but I think it should be evaluated with repeat
 conventional chest radiographs at full inspiration to make sure there is no
 small nidus of infection.  There is no evidence of infection elsewhere in the
 chest.  There is no indication of pleural effusion or central lymph node
 enlargement.  Heart is normal size.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 8:37, when the findings were recognized,
 and we discussed the findings by telephone at 8:40am.
