                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with MRSA skin infection
 and shortness of breath and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal with mild prominence of the left ventricle. 
 Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is preserved lung aeration, but there is
 questionable opacity in the left lower lung as well as in the right upper
 lobe.  There is no pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable infectious process in the lungs.  Given the
 patient's history, followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy is required.  If finding is persistent, assessment with
 chest CT might be considered to exclude other potential etiologies for the
 lung abnormalities.
