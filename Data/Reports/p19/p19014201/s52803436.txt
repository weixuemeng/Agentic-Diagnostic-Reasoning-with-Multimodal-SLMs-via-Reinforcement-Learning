                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea status post thyroid biopsy, here to evaluate for pneumonia
 or pneumomediastinum.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day non contrast CT of the chest. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is thickening of the bilateral peritracheal stripe is in the upper
 mediastinum compatible with the patient's known thyroid mass.  The trachea is
 narrowed at this level appear the cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Minimal calcification of the aortic
 knob is noted.  Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis; however, aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded.  There is
 increase density projecting over the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view.
 No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases may reflect atelectasis;
 however, aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded. 
 
 2.  Thickening of the bilateral paratracheal stripes corresponding to known
 thyroid mass.
