                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Increased interstitial opacities at the lung
 bases bilaterally in the presence of mild cardiomegaly likely represent
 pulmonary edema. Given the lack of prior radiographs, this could however
 represent underlying interstitial abnormality.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy,
 however are not unusually appreciated by plain film. Correlation with physical
 exam is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffuse interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, in
 combination with mild cardiomegaly likely represent pulmonary edema.
 2. Dedicated PA and lateral radiographs are recommended for better evaluation.
 3. Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy,
 and they should be correlated with physical exam.
