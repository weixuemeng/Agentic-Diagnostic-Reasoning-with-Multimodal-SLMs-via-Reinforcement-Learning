                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cardiac arrest - s/p intubation  // tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating
 approximately 1.5 cm above the level of the carinal, recommend withdrawal by
 approximately a 1-2 cm for more optimal positioning.  Enteric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. In
 the interval since the prior study, there has been significant in bilateral
 opacities worrisome for severe/pulmonary edema, underlying aspiration not
 excluded. No large pleural effusions are seen although trace pleural effusions
 are difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm above the chronic recommend
 withdrawal by approximately 1 to 2 cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 Interval development of severe bilateral pulmonary opacities worrisome for
 flash pulmonary edema. Underlying aspiration not excluded.
 
 Above findings discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at ___:___ via
 telephone.
