                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post removal of chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. 
 At the right apex, there is an air-fluid level consistent with a small
 pneumothorax, slightly increased in size from the prior exam.  An opacity in
 the right upper lobe at the site of the wedge resection likely represents a
 small amount of hemorrhage.  Surgical sutures are present.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no new consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A small amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema over the right chest is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  After the right chest tube removal, a small right apical pneumothorax has
 slightly increased in size in comparison to the prior exam one day earlier.
 2.  Stable opacity in the right upper lobe, likely related to a small amount
 of hemorrhage.
