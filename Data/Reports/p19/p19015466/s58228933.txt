 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The patient is status post
 wedge resection of a right upper lobe nodule.  Chain sutures are noted in the

 likely represents resolving hematoma.  The right apical pneumothorax has also
 resolved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
