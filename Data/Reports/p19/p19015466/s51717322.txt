                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever and shortness of breath. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded. There is a wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper
 lobe with less dense opacity more diffusely involving the left upper lobe,
 with evidence of volume loss.  There is a horizontal scar consistent with
 prior resection. There is extension of the left hilum compared to prior
 studies. There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe opacities likely secondary to infection superimposed on known
 worrisome spiculated nodule seen on the prior CT. Continued followup will be
 necessary after treatment for infection.
