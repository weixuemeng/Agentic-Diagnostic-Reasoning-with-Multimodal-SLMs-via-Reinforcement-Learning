                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Admitted with upper GI bleed status post intubation, here to
 evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating
 approximately 3 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm and extending to the right and coiling back to the left of the
 spine, likely in post-pyloric position.  An epidural catheter is in place. 
 The lung volumes are low.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged without overt pulmonary edema.  The
 mediastinal contours are prominent in the setting of low lung volumes but
 likely within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm above the carina.
 2.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
