                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Encephalopathy with transient hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  The frontal view is technically limited due to scattered radiation
 related to the size of the patient.  Nevertheless, when compared to the study
 ___ ___, there is little overall change.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms and increased AP diameter of the chest is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  No definite acute pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.  
 
 Again there is evidence of previous cervical fusion.
