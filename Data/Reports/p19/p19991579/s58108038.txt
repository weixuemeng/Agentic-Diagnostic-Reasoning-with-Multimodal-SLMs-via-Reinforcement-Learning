                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall.  Pain in left knee to mid-calf
 region.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Low lung volumes
 results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy right basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis.
