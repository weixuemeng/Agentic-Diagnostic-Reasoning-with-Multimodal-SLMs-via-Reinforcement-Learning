 ?PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 3 hours prior, the small, left
 pleural effusion has decreased in size.  No pneumothorax.  Of note, there is
 an approximately 2 x 3 cm right paratracheal nodule.  In comparison to the
 recent PET-CT, this may be a summation of an FDG avid peritracheal lymph node
 and the adjacent azygos vein.  No other significant changes from this morning
 are identified.

 Interval decrease in small, left pleural effusion without acute complications
 of thoracentesis.
