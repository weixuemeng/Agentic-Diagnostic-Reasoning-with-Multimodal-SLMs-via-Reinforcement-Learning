 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, diffuse wheezing and rhonchi
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Transcatheter aortic
 valve replacement is re- demonstrated, in unchanged position.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Opacification of the left upper lobe with
 overlying clips is similar compared to the previous studies, better assessed
 on the prior CT.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the left lower lobe.  No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral and
 acromioclavicular joints and within the thoracic spine are unchanged.  Clips
 are also noted projecting over left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged left upper lobe opacity, previously assessed on prior CT.  Patchy
