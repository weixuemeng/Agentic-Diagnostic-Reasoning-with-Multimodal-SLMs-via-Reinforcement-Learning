                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing seizure frequency.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A spinal stimulator device projects over the left hemithorax, as
 before.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky right basilar opacity
 suggests a small focus of atelectasis or scarring.  There is no evidence for
 pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  A prior healed fracture is noted along
 the distal right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
