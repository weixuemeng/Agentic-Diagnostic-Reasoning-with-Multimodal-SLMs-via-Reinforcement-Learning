                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Re- demonstrated is a superior anterior mediastinal
 mass with deviation of the trachea to the right, similar compared to the prior
 exam, likely related to a large thyroid goiter.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unchanged. Lungs are clear. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia. Unchanged superior anterior mediastinal mass with
 rightward tracheal deviation likely reflective of a large thyroid goiter.
