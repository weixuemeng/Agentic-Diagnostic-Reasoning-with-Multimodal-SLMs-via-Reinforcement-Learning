                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 bibasilar opacities are seen, which could relate to chronic interstitial lung
 disease, but in the absence of priors, an infectious process or aspiration is
 not excluded.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta
 is slightly tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
