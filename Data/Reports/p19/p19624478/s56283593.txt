                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new tracheostomy now with fevers and
 copious sputum  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, the ET and NG tube is been
 removed.Tracheostomy tube is in place. A G-tube appears to be present.
 
 Again seen is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly. There has been
 partial clearing of the retrocardiac opacity. There does appear to be some
 leftward shift of the mediastinum, which is unchanged. There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, very
 slightly improved.
 
 At the right lung base, there are some hazy, more nodular densities which were
 not visible on the prior film. Question residua from resolving pulmonary
 edema. The differential diagnosis could include callus about anterior rib
 fractures.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 2. CHF, with interstitial and question alveolar edema, slightly improved
 compared with ___.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, also slightly improved. This
 could include an area of pneumonic infiltrate.
 4. Hazy nodular densities right lung base, newly visible. Question artifact
 due to resolving pulmonary edema versus callus about anterior rib fractures.
 Attention to these areas on followup films are requested.
