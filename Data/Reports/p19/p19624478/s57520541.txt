                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure, influenza  // ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, previously present asymmetrically distributed
 combined alveolar and interstitial opacities have markedly improved with
 residual opacities predominantly in the right perihilar region.  This most
 likely represents asymmetrical edema. Worsening opacity in left retrocardiac
 region is demonstrated, likely a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
