                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with flu, intubated.  // Is ET tube in place?
 Any improvement in left sided opacification?      Is ET tube in place? Any
 improvement in left sided opacifica
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement
 of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the Carina.
 Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper to mid body of the stomach,
 where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Opacification in the left
 lower lung is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural
 effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would
 have to be considered. Right basilar atelectatic changes also seen with small
 effusion.
