  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in stable position.  Left-sided pleural drain
  terminates at the base of the left lung.  A consolidation at the base of the
  left lung is minimally decreased from the prior examination on ___ and
  likely represents a small pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary
  consolidation or atelectasis.  Opacity at the right base likely reflects
  atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
