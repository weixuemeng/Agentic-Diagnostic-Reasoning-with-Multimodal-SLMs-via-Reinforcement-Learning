 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:40 PM
  Low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Slight interval
  increase in size of right basilar pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 
  Essentially unchanged size of left basilar pleural effusion with adjacent
  atelectasis.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Left pleural
  drainage catheter present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma, L sided effusion/chylothorax,
 worsening leukocytosis  // eval for pneumonia, f/u effusion     eval for
 pneumonia, f/u effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction.  The
 left chest tube is in place.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are more pronounced than on the prior study potentially due to
 decreased lung volumes.  Vascular congestion is noted.Right basal opacity in
 the left basal opacity most likely reflect atelectasis but superimposed
 infection is a possibility, attention to this area on the subsequent studies
 is required.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  .
