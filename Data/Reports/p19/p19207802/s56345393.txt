 In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for mild differences in
 degree of rotation there is little overall change.  Again there is radiation
 fibrosis in the perihilar region of the left lung but no definite evidence of
 recurrence of intrathoracic malignancy.  The tip of the PICC line extends to
 the lower SVC.
