 HISTORY:  Liver disease with portal hypertension.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour.  There has been
 decrease in the diffuse opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with

 merely the patient assuming a more erect position.
