                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with history of cirrhosis and ascites, now with diminished
 breath sounds.  Evaluate intrathoracic abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is interval improvement in the previous opacities in the right upper and
 mid lung zones.  A small area of opacification remains in the right upper
 lobe.  There is now a hyperlucent zone at the right lung base, but no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  A small right pleural effusion has developed with associated
 compressive basilar atelectasis.  The left lung is fully expanded and clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  A Dobbhoff tube
 terminates in the first part of the duodenum.  It is looped twice in the
 fundus of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Interval improvement in right upper and mid lung zone opacities, with a
 small area of opacification remaining.
 
 2. Hyperlucent zone at right lung base but no pneumothorax.
 
 3. New small right pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis.
