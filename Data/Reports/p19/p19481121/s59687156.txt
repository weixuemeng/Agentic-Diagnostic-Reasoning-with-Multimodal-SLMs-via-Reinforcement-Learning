                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and worsening mental status, to assess for aspiration or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increasing
 opacification at the bases, especially on the right, which could well
 represent a combination of loculated effusion and consolidation.  CT would be
 of value to further assess this appearance.  Smaller left effusion with
 atelectatic changes at the left base.  Evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette that is accentuated in
 view of the low lung volumes.
