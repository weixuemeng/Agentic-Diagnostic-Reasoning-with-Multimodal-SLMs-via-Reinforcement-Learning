                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cirrhosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinum is not dilated. 
 Lungs are clear.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with most
 likely present right pleural effusion that potentially might reflect ascites
 as well as the elevated right hemidiaphragm which might potentially reflect
 ascites.  No pneumothorax is seen.
