 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Retrocardiac opacity is noted.  Left
 hemidiaphragm is obscured on the frontal view.  No large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The heart
 size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.  However,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
