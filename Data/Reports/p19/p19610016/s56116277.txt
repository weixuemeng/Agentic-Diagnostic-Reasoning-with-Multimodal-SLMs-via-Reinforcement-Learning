                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral images were obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  There are low lung volumes likely due to poor inspiration.  The
 patient is also in a slightly lordotic position.  There is a retrocardiac
 opacity that may be related to poor inspiration or overlying soft tissues, but
 in the appropriate clinical setting this opacity would be concerning for
 possible pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size
 is normal.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, possibly consistent with low lung volumes
 or overlying soft tissue, but could also represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
