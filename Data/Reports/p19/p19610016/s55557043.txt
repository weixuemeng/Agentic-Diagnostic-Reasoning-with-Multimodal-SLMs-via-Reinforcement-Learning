                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  AP and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. 
 Lung volumes are again low, probably due to poor inspiration.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is similar in appearance to prior on the frontal but improved onthe
 lateral likely from better inspiratory effort.   There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and mildly
 enlarged.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change since the prior radiograph.  Retrocardiac
 opacity likely due to atelectasis; however, infectious process cannot be
 completely excluded.
