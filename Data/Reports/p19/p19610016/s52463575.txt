                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presenting with cocaine and alcohol use.  Complaining of chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is a linear opacity in the right
 base, which is new from the prior exam.  There is an ill-defined opacity at
 the left base, which appears mostly stable, and may represent prominent
 osteophytes.  The apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, which are likely due to atelectasis,
 although a developing infiltrate cannot be completely excluded.  Further
 evaluation with oblique views is recommended to better characterize the
 opacities.
 
 Recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ resident) at 10 AM on ___
