                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lethargy and confusion.  Evaluation for
 cause of prominent left-sided crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate diffuse
 granular/reticular opacities in the bilateral lungs, with relative sparing of
 the right lower lobe, likely due to underlying chronic fibrotic disease. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse granular/reticular opacities, likely due to underlying
 chronic fibrotic disease.  Superinfection cannot be excluded, and correlation
 with prior imaging is recommended.  If none is available, dedicated CT with
 contrast could be performed if clinically indicated.
