                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of systolic heart failure,
 now with wheezing, presence of infiltrates versus pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened but no local contour
 abnormalities are seen.  Tiny small calcifications are seen in the wall at the
 level of the arch.  The patient has a permanent pacer in left anterior
 axillary position connected to a single ICD electrode terminating in a
 position compatible with the right ventricular apical portion.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Relatively low positioned and somewhat
 flattened diaphragms as well as thin linear densities on the bases, more on
 the right than the left are suggestive of COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates
 cannot be seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax show mild degenerative changes within the thoracic
 spine without evidence of vertebral body compression.  Otherwise, grossly
 unremarkable skeletal findings.
 
 A preceding chest examination obtained during the same day showed a
 right-sided PICC line which was advanced into the right jugular vein in
 retrograde fashion.  This line has been removed at the time of the present
 examination.
