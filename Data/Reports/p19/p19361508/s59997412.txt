                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:10 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post mediastinoscopy and VATS for
 adenocarcinoma.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and change in the subcutaneous
 emphysema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:09.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 9:10 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Single-lead left-sided pacer remains unchanged in position.  There
 continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema which now extends across the
 midline involving the lateral left soft tissues as well.  There may be some
 tracking into the superior mediastinum.  In addition, the small-to-moderate
 right pneumothorax is stable.  The left lung remains clear.  Linear opacity at
 left costophrenic angle is again seen, possibly representing scarring or
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
