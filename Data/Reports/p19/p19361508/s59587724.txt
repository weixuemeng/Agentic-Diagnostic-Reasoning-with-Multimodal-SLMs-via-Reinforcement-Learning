 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dizziness and
 lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 single-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right atrium.  Post-surgical changes involving the right
 hemithorax are again seen.  Nodular pulmonary opacities seen on prior CT are
 better evaluated on CT.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes involving the right hemithorax; otherwise, no
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
