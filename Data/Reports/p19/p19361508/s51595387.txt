                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post upper right middle lobectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. 
 Left transvenous pacemaker lead tip is in standard position in the right
 ventricle.  Extensive subcutaneous gas in the right chest and neck bilaterally
 is grossly unchanged.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion.  There is
 evidence loss of volume in the right chest secondary to surgery.  The lungs
 are grossly clear, though evaluation of subtle lung abnormalities is limited
 due to the presence of the extensive subcutaneous gas.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable right apical pneumothorax.
