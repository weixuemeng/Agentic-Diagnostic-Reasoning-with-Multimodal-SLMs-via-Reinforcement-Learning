                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  LGIB status post extended right hemicolectomy, Meckle's
 diverticulectomy, status post take-back for bleeding, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:31 a.m.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is mild cardiomegaly, likely
 unchanged.  There is upper zone re-distribution, but no overt CHF.  There is a
 minimal patchy opacity at both bases, which could reflect the presence of
 atelectasis.  Possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No effusion.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 Compared with the prior film, ET tube, NG tube and right-sided line have been
 removed.
