                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to multiple previous
 exam from ___.  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation.  There
 is, however, suggestion of a nodular opacity just lateral to the right hilum,
 not clearly identified on the previous, which could potentially be due to
 differences in positioning and overlap of the hilar structures versus a new
 finding.  Elsewhere, the lungs are unremarkable.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1.3-cm nodular opacity in the right perihilar region for which
 dedicated chest CT is suggested.
