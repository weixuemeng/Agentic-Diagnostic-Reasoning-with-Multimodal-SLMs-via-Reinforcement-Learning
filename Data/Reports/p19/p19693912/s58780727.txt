 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Given differences in positioning and technique, there
 has been no significant interval change.  The lungs are essentially clear
 without pulmonary vascular congestion or consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Extensive degenerative change is again seen at the
 glenohumeral joint.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
