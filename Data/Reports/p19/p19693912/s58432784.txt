                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes, but otherwise little change.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper
 limits of normal and there is again some opacification at the left base most
 likely representing atelectasis and possible small effusion.
