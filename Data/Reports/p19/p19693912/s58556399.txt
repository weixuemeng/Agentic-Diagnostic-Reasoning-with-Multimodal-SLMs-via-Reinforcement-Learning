                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left PICC pulled back 1 cm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:10 p.m. and at 5:23 p.m.
 
 FRONTAL UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Left PICC tip is seen at the origin of the
 SVC, no longer within the azygos vein.  Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Left basilar atelectasis is similar. Mild opacity
 in the right upper lobe may be residual infection. The previous right lower
 lobe abnormality has cleared. No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient
 position.  Degenerative change is noted within the right shoulder girdle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left PICC ends at the origin of the SVC.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ the findings with ___ (IV nurse) by phone at 2:15
 p.m. on ___.
