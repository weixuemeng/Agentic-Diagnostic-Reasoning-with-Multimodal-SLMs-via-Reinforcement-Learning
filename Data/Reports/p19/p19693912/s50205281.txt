                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXRS ___, ___, and ___;  CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged allowing
 for differences in lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
