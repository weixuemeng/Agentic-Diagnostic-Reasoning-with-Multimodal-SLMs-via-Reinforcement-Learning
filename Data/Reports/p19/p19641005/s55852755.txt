                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p lap appy (perf) ___ p/e postoperative fever  // assess
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent left basilar opacity.  , unchanged compared to the prior
 study.  Again this may reflect a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  The right basilar opacities are unchanged.  No
 additional areas of concern are identified in the bilateral lungs.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.  No pneumothorax seen.  The
 free air seen under the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with the patient's
 recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  Persistent
 airspace opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis however pneumonia cannot be excluded.
