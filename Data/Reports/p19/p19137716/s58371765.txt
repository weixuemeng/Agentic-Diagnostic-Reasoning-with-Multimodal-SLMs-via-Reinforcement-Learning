                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings,
 particularly at the lung bases.  Given this, no focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process .  Dedicated
 PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful for further evaluation if
 patient able.
