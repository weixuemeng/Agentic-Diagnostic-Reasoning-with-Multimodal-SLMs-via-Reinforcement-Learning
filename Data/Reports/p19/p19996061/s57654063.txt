                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left upper lobe cavitary mass which is similar in
 size to the prior chest CT.  There is associated destruction of the adjacent
 ribs, most marked in the lateral left second and third ribs.  Since the prior
 exam, there is worsening opacification at the bilateral bases, more prominent
 on the right than the left.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing basilar opacities, slightly more worse on the right than the
 left.  These are nonspecific, though could represent infection.  
 2.  Grossly unchanged large left upper lobe cavitary mass with destruction of
 the adjacent ribs.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone by
 Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
