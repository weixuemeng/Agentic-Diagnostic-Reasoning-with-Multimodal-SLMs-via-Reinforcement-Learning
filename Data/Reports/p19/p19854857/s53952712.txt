                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the left upper to mid lung, projecting over the anterior
 left better in rib is slightly less conspicuous as compared to the prior
 study; findings may represent overlap of structures, however an underlying
 pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the anterior left third rib, may represent
 overlap of structures but a pulmonary nodule or a tiny consolidation not
 excluded.  Recommend shallow obliques or nonemergent chest CT for further
 assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Subtle opacity projecting over the anterior left third
 rib, may represent overlap of structures but a pulmonary nodule or a tiny
 consolidation not excluded. Recommend shallow obliques or nonemergent chest CT
 for further assessment.
