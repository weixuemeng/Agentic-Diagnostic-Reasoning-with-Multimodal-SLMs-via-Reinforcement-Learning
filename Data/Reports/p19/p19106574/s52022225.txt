  1.  Small right pneumothorax.
  2.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
  3. Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis,
  pneumonia, aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
  4. 3.3 cm rounded right upper lobe opacity is consistent with known right
  upper lobe adenocarcinoma with radiopaque clip.
  5.  Stable mild cardiomegaly with mild vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea.  Assess for CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  FDG PET ___
 CT chest without contrast ___
 Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral, right greater than left, heterogeneous lower lobe
 opacities with a small right pleural effusion.  No left pleural effusion.
 Again seen is a 3.2 x 3.3 cm rounded opacity within the right upper lobe with
 a radiopaque clip which is unchanged since prior examination.  Mild
 cephalization of vasculature is noted.  Stable mild cardiomegaly which is
 obscured due to overlying parenchymal abnormality.  Small right pneumothorax. 
 No left pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small right pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis,
 pneumonia, aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 4.  3.3 cm rounded right upper lobe opacity is consistent with known right
 upper lobe adenocarcinoma with CyberKnife clip.
 5.  Stable mild cardiomegaly with mild vascular congestion.
