                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 723 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subarachnoid hemorrhage, assess for
 interval change status post diuresis.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 723 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stably enlarged cardiac
 contours.  There is likely a layering left effusion with associated airspace
 opacity which most likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis, although an
 acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  There continues to be diffuse
 bilateral airspace process which is slightly improved since the prior study,
 favoring resolving but persistent moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 within the stomach.  Calcification of the aorta consistent with
 atherosclerosis.
