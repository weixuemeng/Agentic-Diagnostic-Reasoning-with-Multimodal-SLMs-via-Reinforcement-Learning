                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, metastatic pancreatic cancer
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AND ___ CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Patient's known pulmonary
 nodules are better assessed on recent CT of the chest.  There is increased
 opacity in the right lower lung which could reflect atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.  There is also increasing retrocardiac opacity suggesting left
 lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Tiny pleural effusions are likely
 present.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacities in the lower lungs concerning for atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.  Pulmonary nodules better assessed on prior CT.  Probable tiny
 pleural effusions.
