                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fevers, evolving PNA of RML on portable CXR.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   AICD is unchanged with leads
 extending to the region the right atrium right ventricle. The subtle opacity
 seen on earlier exam in the right mid to lower lung is less conspicuous and
 overall lung volumes are improved. Therefore, findings most likely
 attributable to atelectasis. On the current exam, there is no convincing
 evidence for pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing
 signs of edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged. Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved lung volumes with decrease conspicuity of right lower lung opacity,
 therefore, findings more compatible with atelectasis.
