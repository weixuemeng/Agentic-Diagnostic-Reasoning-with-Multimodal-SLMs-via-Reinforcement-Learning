 developing dyspnea and hypoxia x 1 day  // ?pna. Worsened hypoxia and new

 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is again diffuse
 prominence of the interstitial markings.  Enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is not again seen with pacer device in place.  The diffuse
 interstitial changes could be a manifestation of chronic lung disease, perhaps
 exacerbated by amiodarone toxicity, pulmonary vascular congestion, or
 combination of these factors.
