 median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 More confluent opacity at the right lung base, similar to prior, could
 represent overlying vasculature, although underlying consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
