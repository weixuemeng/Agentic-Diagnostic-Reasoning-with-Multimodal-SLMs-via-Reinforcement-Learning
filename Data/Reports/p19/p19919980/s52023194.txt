                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with infiltrates, effusion, edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is in adequate position.  The distal end of the NG tube is hard to
 assess on this chest x-ray.  Moderate interstitial edema is unchanged.  The
 lung volumes are low and there is increased opacity at the left lung base,
 which could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  Pleural effusions
 are small if any.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiac contour
 enlargement is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema is stable.
 2.  Left lower lobe opacification is new since yesterday, which could reflect
 atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.
