                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent MI, desaturation.  Please evaluate CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient has been extubated.  Volume overload is minimal and unchanged since
 ___ considering a different technique.  There is increased
 density in the right lower lung, which could be compatible with aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Left lower lung consolidation has, however, improved.  Pleural
 effusions are probably small and unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged minimal pulmonary edema.
 2.  Increase in right lower lung opacity is worrisome for aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 3.  Left lower lung consolation has slightly improved.  
 
 The vascular intern was paged.
