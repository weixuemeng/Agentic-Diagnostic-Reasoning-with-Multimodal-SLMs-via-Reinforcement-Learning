                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with EVAR required reintubation.  Rule out volume
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 New ET tube ends 4.8 cm above the carina.  There is new mild pulmonary edema. 
 The left hilum looks more convexed but recent CT did not show any pulmonary
 artery dilation, this could be explained by the rotation of the patient. 
 Pleural effusion is small if any.  Cardiac contour is mildly enlarged.  Mild
 new left lower lung opacities could be due to atelectasis or dependent edema. 
 Close followup of this area is suggested,
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema is new.
 2.  Mild left lower lung opacities could be due to atelectasis or dependent
 edema.  Aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 settings.
