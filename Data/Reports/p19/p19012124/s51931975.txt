  No priors for comparison.  Left pectoral device is present with leads

  pneumothorax difficult.  Mild cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/___ CRT-D implant  // ptx, leads      ptx, leads
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs are not available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural
 abnormality.  Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads and
 right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are continuous from the left
 pectoral generator in follow their expected courses.
 
 Both hila are enlarged, right greater than left, presumably due to dilated
 pulmonary arteries there, but conventional radiographs would be helpful to
 exclude a right hilar mass, because the right hilus is contiguous with an
 enlarged left atrium.
