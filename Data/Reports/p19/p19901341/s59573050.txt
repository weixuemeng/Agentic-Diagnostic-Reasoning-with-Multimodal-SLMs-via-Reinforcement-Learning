 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  The lungs appear
 clear.  Vague sclerosis projects along the anterior aspect of the left third,
 fourth and sixth ribs, possibly due to interval nondisplaced fractures
 although not necessarily acute.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Possible nondisplaced rib
 fractures on the left although not necessarily acute.
