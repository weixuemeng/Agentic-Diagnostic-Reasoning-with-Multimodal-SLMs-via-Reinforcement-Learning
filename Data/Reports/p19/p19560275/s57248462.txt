                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:

 INDICATION:  History: ___M with DOE, fall, orbital ecchymosis, on warfarin  //
 Eval for acute trauma, evidence of CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is cardiomegaly. 
 Prominence of the main pulmonary artery raises concern for pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Fluid is seen along the right major fissure, likely loculated. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Right perihilar opacity may be
 due to vascular congestion and/or atelectasis, although focal consolidation is
 difficult to exclude.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with likely loculated component along the right
 major fissure.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomegaly.
