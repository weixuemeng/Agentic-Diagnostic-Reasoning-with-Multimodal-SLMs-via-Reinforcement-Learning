                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with renal cancer presents with right leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are bilateral nodular opacities
 in the lungs compatible with patient's known metastatic disease.  New from
 prior chest x-ray but seen on interval CT scan is a left-sided pleural
 effusion with associated atelectasis.  Increased pleural based opacity on the
 left laterally adjacent to the lung base is likely progression of metastatic
 disease as well.  Trace right effusion is also seen.  There is no definite
 superimposed acute consolidation although one would be difficult to exclude
 and definite acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left-sided pleural effusion, as seen on prior chest CT, with additional
 increased left basilar opacity potentially due to progression of metastatic
 disease although superimposed acute process would be difficult to exclude.
