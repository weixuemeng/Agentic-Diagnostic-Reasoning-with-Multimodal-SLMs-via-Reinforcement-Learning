                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic carcinoma, to assess for metastases to ribs.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increased
 prominence of indistinct pulmonary vessels suggesting some increase in
 pulmonary venous pressure.  There also is continued blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle with increased opacification at the left base consistent
 with pleural effusion.  Bibasilar compressive atelectasis is seen.
