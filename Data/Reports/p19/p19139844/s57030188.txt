                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of chest were compared with prior
 studies from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A large, near homogeneous opacity of 4 x 4.6 cm in the left lower lung in the
 pericardiac region which on lateral view overlies the cardiac silhouette and
 hence confined to the lingula is new since ___.  In view of
 history this may represent lymphomatous deposits, however, other differential
 diagnosis include lung infection.  There is a probable mild left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pleural effusion on the right side.  Right lung is
 clear.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged in appearance as compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left lower lung opacity, which is anatomically located in
 the lingula, is new since ___.  In view of history the likely
 possibilities include a lymphoma deposit, however, lung infection cannot be
 ruled out. Contrast-enhanced CECT of thorax is recommended for further
 evaluation.
