                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  V-fib arrest on cooling /warming, question tube placement edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip overlying gastric fundus.  
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, unchanged, with upper zone redistribution and
 diffusely increased interstitial markings.  More confluent opacities are seen
 in the left lower lobe and right cardiophrenic region, worse compared with
 ___, consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  Possibility
 of small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 There is a linear density seen along the right chest wall, similar to the
 prior study.  Is there reason to suspect a rib fracture in this location?  
 Alternatively, this could represent something outside of the patient.
