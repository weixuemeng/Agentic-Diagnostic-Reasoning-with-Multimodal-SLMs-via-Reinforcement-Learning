                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate focal opacity in the
 both lower lobes compatible with atelectasis or early pneumonia.  There is
 biapical scarring.  There may be a tiny right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A tortuous aorta is noted. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are noted. Multiple old bilateral rib fractures are
 noted, and a mild to moderate compression deformity of an upper lumbar
 vertebral body is age-indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe opacities represent atelectasis or early
 pneumonia.
