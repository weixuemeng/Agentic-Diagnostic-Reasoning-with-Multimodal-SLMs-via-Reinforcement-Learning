                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a mildly enlarged heart,
 unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Paramediastinal radiation
 fibrosis is unchanged, allowing for differences in inspiration.  There may be
 slightly decreased volume in the right lower lobe, with mild rightward shift
 of the mediastinum.  There is a new focal opacity in the left upper lung, as
 well as increased opacity in the right lung.   Bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left, right increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New focal opacity in the left upper lung, as well as more diffusely in the
 right lung.  These are evaluated in greater detail on CTA chest from the same
 day.
 2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
