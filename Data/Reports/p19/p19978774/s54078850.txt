                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  An SVC stent is re-
 demonstrated in unchanged position compared to the previous CT.  The heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  Paramediastinal radiation fibrosis is again noted. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged, with the known
 anterior mediastinal mass better appreciated on the previous chest CT. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Small
 right pleural effusion with thickening along the right minor fissure is
 unchanged.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases.  No new focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Known metastatic involvement of the
 manubrium is also better assessed on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous chest CT.  Continued small
 right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.  Paramediastinal radiation
 fibrosis re- demonstrated.
