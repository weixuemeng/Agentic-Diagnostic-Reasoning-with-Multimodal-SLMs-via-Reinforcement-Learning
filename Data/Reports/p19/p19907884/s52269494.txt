                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes and bronchovascular crowding.  There is prominence of the
 hila suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Left
 infrahilar and left basilar opacity may relate to vascular crowding, although
 infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 There are right paramediastinal surgical clips.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
