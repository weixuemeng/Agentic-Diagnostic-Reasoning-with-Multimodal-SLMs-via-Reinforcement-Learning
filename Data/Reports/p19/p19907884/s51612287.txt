                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hyperglycemia and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.
 There is been interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter, with
 the tip likely within the proximal right atrium.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No definite focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation identified.
 2. A right internal jugular catheter terminates within the proximal right
 atrium. This catheter can be pulled back approximately 2.5-3 cm to place the
 tip in the distal SVC, if desired.
