                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable radiograph of chest.
 
 Compared with prior studies from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 With the patient's neck in flexed position, the endotracheal tube ending
 approximately 7cm above the carina is highly placed.  Consider advancing the
 endotracheal tube by additional 4 cm for better seating.  New left internal
 jugular line ends at the left vertebral margins and is likely within the left
 brachiocephalic trunk.  Considering advancing by additional 2.5 cm to 3 cm. 
 Left PICC line ends at lower SVC.  Both lung volumes are low and remarkable
 for minimal bibasal atelectasis.  No oacities concerning for pneumonia.  A
 thin, curved, radioopaque structure is seen extending from right medial basal
 lung till right hypochrondriac region. Its clinical significance was discussed
 with Dr.___ by phone on ___ at 4.50PM, but my discussion led to
 conclude this as of uncertain nature. I recommend a lateral radiograph for
 further evaluation to see if this is a artifact or real. Orogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach and is adequately placed. 
 An abdominal drain tube is seen in the left upper abdomen.  
 
 Above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at
 4:50 p.m.
