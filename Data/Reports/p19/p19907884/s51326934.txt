                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  Continued low lung volumes but no definite
 evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or vascular congestion.
 
 As on the prior study, there is some poor definition of the right heart border
 that could well represent crowding of vessels.
