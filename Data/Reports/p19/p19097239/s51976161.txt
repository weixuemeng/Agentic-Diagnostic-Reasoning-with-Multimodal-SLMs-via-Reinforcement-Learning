                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, right IJ placed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  In the interval since the prior study, there has
 been significant interval increase in perihilar opacities worrisome for
 moderate pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion is seen although a trace
 right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.
