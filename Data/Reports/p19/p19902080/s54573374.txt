 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a nasogastric tube that extends well into the stomach where it crosses the
 lower margin of the image.  The position of the endotracheal tube is
 unchanged.  The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, suggesting clearing
 of a mucous plug with subsequent improved aeration in the left lower lobe.
