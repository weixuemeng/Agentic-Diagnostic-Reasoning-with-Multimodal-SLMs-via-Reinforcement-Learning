                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke s/p TPA, intubated  // eval for
 interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  There is silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting
 of the costophrenic angle, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and small pleural effusion.
 
 Mild obliquity of the patient to the left is probably responsible for the
 apparent displacement of mediastinal contents to this side.
