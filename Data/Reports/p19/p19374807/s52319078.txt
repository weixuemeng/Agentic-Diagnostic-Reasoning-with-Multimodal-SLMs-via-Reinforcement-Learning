                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, elevated BNP and right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:    The heart is moderately enlarged.  The interstitium is prominent
 including Kerley B lines suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Streaky left mid
 lung opacities may alternatively be due to atelectasis, however.  The left
 posterior lower lobe appears opacified, which could be seen with coinciding
 pneumonia or potentially atelectasis.  An element of volume loss in the left
 lower lobe including depression of the major fissure and slight elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  A small pleural effusion is probable on the left and
 difficult to completely exclude on the right.  Fissures are thickened.  The
 bones are probably demineralized.  There is incompletely characterized loss in
 height among several mid-to-lower thoracolumbar vertebral bodies including a
 moderate mid-to-lower thoracic compression fracture, age indeterminate,
 although there is no reason to think that this is likely to be recent in
 onset.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Focal opacification in the left lower lobe with volume loss.  This
 appearance could be seen with clinically suspected pneumonia, versus
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Findings also suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Thoracolumbar compression deformities.
