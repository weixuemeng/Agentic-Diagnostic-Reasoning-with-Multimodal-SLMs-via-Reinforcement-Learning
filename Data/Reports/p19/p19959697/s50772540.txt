                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of severe peripheral arterial
 disease who was admitted to the vascular surgery service for non-healing left
 malleolar wound s/p BKA with hypoxia and fluid overload vs. multifocal
 pneumonia gradually worsening on previous CXRs.  // Improving pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC terminates at mid SVC.  Lung volume remains low.  Extensive
 airspace opacities in bilateral lungs are less compared to 1 day ago. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is possible small right pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive airspace opacity is less than 1 day ago, likely reflecting improved
 pulmonary edema in setting of multifocal pneumonia.
