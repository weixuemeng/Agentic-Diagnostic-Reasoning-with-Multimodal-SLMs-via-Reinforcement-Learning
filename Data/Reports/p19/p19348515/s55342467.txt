                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large right-sided pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  There is minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view, not well substantiated on the lateral
 view with a very trace left pleural effusions not excluded.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen in the left lung.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed
 due to the large right-sided opacity.  Old-appearing rib fracture is seen
 approximately at the level of the right posterior sixth rib.  The posterior
 ribs inferior to this are not well assessed due to large right-sided opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.
