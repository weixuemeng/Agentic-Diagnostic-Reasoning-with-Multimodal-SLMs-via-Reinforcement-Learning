 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right pleural effusion status post
 thoracentesis.  Questionable right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.  There
 is a very tiny right apical pneumothorax, which is unchanged.  There are again
 seen bilateral pleural effusions with areas of consolidation in the right
 base.  This likely represents partially loculated fluid.  Heart size is upper
 limits of normal but stable.  Overall, there has been no significant change.
