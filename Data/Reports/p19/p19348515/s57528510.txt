 FINDINGS:  A right pigtail catheter is unchanged.  The remnant effusion is
 stable.  Again noted is mild pulmonary edema, although improved since the

 represent asymmetric edema, however this seems less likely given the
 improvement in edema in the right lung.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.

 2.  Opacity in the right midlung concerning for infection given the
 improvement in pulmonary edema.
