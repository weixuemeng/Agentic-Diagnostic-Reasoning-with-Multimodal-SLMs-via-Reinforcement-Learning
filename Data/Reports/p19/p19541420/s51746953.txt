                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and left lung rhonchi. 
 Recent pulmonary embolism, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  As before, there is considerable right-sided convex scoliosis
 in the lower thoracic spine, with corresponding mild shift of the mediastinal
 structures towards the left.  All these findings are unchanged.  No cardiac
 enlargement is present now, thoracic aorta remains unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain
 normal.  A most recent chest CT of ___ is reviewed and showed
 multiple bilateral basal peripheral pulmonary emboli.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged chest findings in comparison with previous study of
 ___.  Thus, no cardiac enlargement or acute pulmonary infiltrates.  Thus, it
 can be concluded that the episode of pulmonary emboli did not result in major
 infarctions or pleural effusions.
