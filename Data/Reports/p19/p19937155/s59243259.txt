 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:17.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pre-existing very
 diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, likely reflecting interstitial lung
 edema, are unchanged as compared to the previous image.  This is supported by
 the presence of pleural effusion, evident on the lateral image.  No additional
 focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  However, in the right lung,
 subtle calcified granulomas are present.  The patient also shows several
 calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.
