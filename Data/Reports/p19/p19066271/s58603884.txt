                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with esophageal ca, with fever and productive
 cough  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle most likely due to a small pleural
 effusion/pleural thickening.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.  The partially imaged right
 humeral prosthesis.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to pleural thickening
 versus trace pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation.
