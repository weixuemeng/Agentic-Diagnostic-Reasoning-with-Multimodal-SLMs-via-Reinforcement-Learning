                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There is mild enlargement of the hila.  A left lower lobe
 consolidation is concerning for pneumonia.  There is a peculiar constellation
 of linear structures in the right lung extending from the right hilus, where
 it is thicker, to the periphery.  These structures are of unclear etiology.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Peculiar constellation of linear structures in the right lung, of unclear
 etiology.  Unless there are pertinent findings in the clinical history to
 explain this, a CT chest may be required for further evaluation.  The timing
 of the this CT, however, should be dictated by progression of the left lower
 lobe pneumonia.
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
