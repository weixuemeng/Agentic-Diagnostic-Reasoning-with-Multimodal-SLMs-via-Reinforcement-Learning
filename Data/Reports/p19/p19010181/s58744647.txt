                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left lower lobe
 pneumonia, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is substantial interval improvement with almost complete resolution of
 right upper lobe and right lower lobe opacities as well as left basal
 opacities.  The findings are consistent with resolution of multifocal
 pneumonia and potentially minimal scarring present in the right upper lobe. 
 Re-assessment in four weeks might be considered for documentation of complete
 resolution.  There is no pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
