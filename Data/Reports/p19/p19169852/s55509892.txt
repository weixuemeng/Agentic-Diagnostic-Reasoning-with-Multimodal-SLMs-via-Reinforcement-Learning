                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with end-stage CHF, increased ___ edema, dyspnea, evaluate for
 acute change, attention to pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest cardiac device is an unchanged orientation, and associated leads
 demonstrate a stable configuration in comparison to prior radiograph from
 ___.  There is stable severe cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion
 and likely moderate pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac opacity may represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, however infection cannot be
 excluded by radiograph.  There is probably a trace left pleural effusion. 
 There is no prior right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable severe cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascular ingestion and likely
 moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. Likely small left pleural effusion.
 3. Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis,
 however infection cannot be excluded by radiograph in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
