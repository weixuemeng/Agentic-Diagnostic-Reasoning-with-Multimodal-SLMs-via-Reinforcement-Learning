                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Ten days of worsening shortness of breath and cough
 as well as blood in sputum.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No abnormality is seen on the chest radiograph.  Given patient complaints,
 assessment with chest CT might be considered to exclude the possibility of
 endobronchial abnormality which is radiographically occult.
