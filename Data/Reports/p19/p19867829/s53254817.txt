                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been a substantial decrease
 in size of the left pleural effusion which is almost completely resolved. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A hazy opacity overlying the right upper lobe is
 unchanged and most likely represents an infection, although asymmetric edema
 could be considered.  There is no right pleural effusion.  A right PICC ends
 in the low SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Right upper lobe opacity is most likely pneumonia, although asymmetric
 edema can be considered.
