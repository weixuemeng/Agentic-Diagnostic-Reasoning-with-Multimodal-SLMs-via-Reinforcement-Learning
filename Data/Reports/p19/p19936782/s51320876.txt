 WET READ: ___ ___ 4:39 PM
  1.  Air-fluid level in the right hemithorax raising concern for
  hydropneumothorax.  Additional imaging with CT is suggested.
  
  2.  Increased density at the right lung apex medially, potentially within the
  lung apex versus tortuosity of vessels and possible thyroid enlargement.  This
  can be further assessed at time of CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with recent fall and failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  As on prior, there is increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs potentially chronic heart failure. 
 Increased soft tissue density seen at the right lung apex medially.  This area
 was not well evaluated on the most recent prior.  There has been interval
 development of an apparent right air-fluid level on the frontal.  There is
 also a moderate left pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 unchanged.  Diffuse osteopenia is noted.  No displaced fractures seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Air-fluid level in the right hemithorax raising concern for
 hydropneumothorax.  Additional imaging with CT is suggested.
 
 2.  Increased density at the right lung apex medially, potentially within the
 lung apex versus tortuosity of vessels and possible thyroid enlargement.  This
 can be further assessed at time of CT.
