                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Multiple radiographs of the chest and upper abdomen
 
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement and advancement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:51
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple radiographs of the chest and upper abdomen were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  Again identified is a dense left
 retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm compatible with left
 lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.  ET tube terminates approximately
 7 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicles an could be advanced by
 approximately 3 cm.  The weighted feeding tube terminates in the distal
 stomach.  Another enteric tube terminates in the proximal stomach.  The right
 renal cases are opacified by contrast, likely related to a prior intravenous
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles and could be advanced by
 approximately 3 cm.
 2. Weighted feeding tube terminates in the distal stomach.  Another enteric
 tube parallel to this weighted feeding tube terminates in the mid stomach.
 3. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
