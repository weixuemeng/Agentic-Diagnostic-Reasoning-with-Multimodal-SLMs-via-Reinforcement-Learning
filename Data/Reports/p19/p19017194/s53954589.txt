                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine frontal radiographs of the chest and pelvis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 CHEST:  The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.  No
 acute displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 PELVIS:  Comminuted right acetabular fracture, with superolatearl positioning
 of the right femoral head  consistent with dislocation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comminuted right acetabular fracture and right hip dislocation.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
