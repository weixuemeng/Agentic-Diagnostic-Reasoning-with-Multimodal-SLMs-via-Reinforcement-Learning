                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with known right-sided rib fractures and small
 contusion, assess for evolution.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Right upper lobe peripheral
 opacities are unchanged, consistent with contusions.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Multiple right rib fractures are better seen in prior CT.
