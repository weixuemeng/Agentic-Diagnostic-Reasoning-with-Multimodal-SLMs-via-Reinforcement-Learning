                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema and inspiratory crackles.  Evaluation for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate slightly lower lung volumes than
 on the prior study.  Increased interstitial marking are potentially due to
 lower volumes and possible vascular congestion.  No focal opacity is seen. 
 There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle, with possible trace
 pleural effusion.  The heart size is moderately enlarged, but stable, with a
 tortuous aorta.  No pneumothorax is seen and there is no evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
