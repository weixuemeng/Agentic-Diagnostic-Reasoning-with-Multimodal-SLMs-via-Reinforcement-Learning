 pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube again extends into the stomach.
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower

 the left lower zone. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Dilatation of the colon in the region of the splenic flexure is again seen.
