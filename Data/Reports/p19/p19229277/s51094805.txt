                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known apical pneumo. Dyspnea  // r/o
 expanding pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The very small left apical pneumothorax has increased compared with the prior
 study of ___, now moderate in size. Allowing for rotation there
 is no apparent midline shift. There are stable atelectatic changes at the left
 apex and both lung bases. A moderate left pleural effusion is increased with
 associated compressive atelectasis. The density of the left mid lung likely
 represents loculated pleural effusion, however consolidation cannot be ruled
 out. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate left apical pneumothorax has increased.
 2. Moderate left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis has
 increased.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
