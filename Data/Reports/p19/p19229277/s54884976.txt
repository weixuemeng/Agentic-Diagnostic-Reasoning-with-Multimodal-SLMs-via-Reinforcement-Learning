                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with toxic ingestion  // Pneumonitis vs.
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance. There are
 increased interstitial opacities bilaterally, however, there is an overall
 poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes which limits interpretation, as
 this may simply be due to crowding of normal vascular structures. It is
 recommended to repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory effort for better
 visualization of lung parenchyma.
 
 There is loss of definition of the right lateral costophrenic angle which is
 likely due to small right pleural effusion.  There are no pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Limited study due to poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes with
 apparent new interstitial process, likely edema.  Recommend repeat radiograph
 with improved inspiration.
 2. Small right pleural effusion.
