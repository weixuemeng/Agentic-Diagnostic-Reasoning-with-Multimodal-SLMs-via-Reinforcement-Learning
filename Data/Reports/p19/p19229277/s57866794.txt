 Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Linear opacity at the left base is
 unchanged and may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or possibly scarring. 
 Small left layering effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity which may
 reflect lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also

 suggesting a fluid replete state but no overt pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
