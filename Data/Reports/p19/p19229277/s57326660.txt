                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bleach ingestion, vomiting
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced. The heart size is top normal. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mild interstitial prominence
 with peribronchial cuffing could suggest slight vascular congestion or airway
 inflammation. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but
 are nonspecific, and aspiration is not excluded. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial prominence with peribronchial cuffing could suggest mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion or airway inflammation.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities are nonspecific, possibly atelectasis but aspiration is not
 excluded.
