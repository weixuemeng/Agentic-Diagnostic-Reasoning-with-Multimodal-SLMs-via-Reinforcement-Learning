                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain s/p bleach ingestion  // r/o
 acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in lung
 volumes. There has been marked interval improved aeration in the left lower
 lobe with residual retrocardiac opacity remaining as well as mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm. Bandlike, linear atelectasis is also present in the
 lingula. Small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. The right
 lung and pleural surfaces are clear. Distended loops of bowel with air-fluid
 levels in the imaged upper abdomen are incompletely imaged on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving left lower lobe atelectasis and decreasing small left pleural
 effusion.
 
 INCOMPLETELY EVALUATED DISTENDED LOOPS OF BOWEL IN THE IMAGED UPPER ABDOMEN.
 CONSIDER DEDICATED ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH SERIES FOR MORE COMPLETE EVALUATION IF
 WARRANTED CLINICALLY.
