                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothorax  // change in pneumothorax?
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small volume of pleural fluid in the left lower chest and atelectasis in the
 left lower lung have both improved. Very small apical pneumothorax is slightly
 smaller. The absence of fluid levels suggests that the major the components of
 air and fluid are not in free communication, due to loculations.
 
 Lung volumes have improved generally but there is still platelike atelectasis
 in the right lower lobe as well. Heart size is normal.
