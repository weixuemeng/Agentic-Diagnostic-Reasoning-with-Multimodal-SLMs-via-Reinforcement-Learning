                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, LAD- reassess CHF  // f/u CHF     
 f/u CHF
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Engorgement of AL-defined
 pulmonary vessels is consistent with pulmonary edema, though some of the
 interstitial prominence could be a manifestation of chronic lung disease. 
 There is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and
 compressive basilar atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 Scattered upper lung calcified granulomas are again seen.
