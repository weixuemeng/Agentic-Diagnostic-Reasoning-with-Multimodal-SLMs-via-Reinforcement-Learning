                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NSTEMI, AFib with RVR and hypertension, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE, AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  There is moderate-to-moderately
 severe cardiomegaly.  Sternotomy wires and a prosthetic aortic valve are
 noted.  The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, but
 significantly improved compared with the most recent prior radiograph from
 ___.  No focal infiltrate/consolidation and no effusion is
 identified. Probable calcified granuloma right upper zone. Previously seen
 effusions and basilar collapse and/or consolidation has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly, with prosthetic valve.  
 2.  Probable COPD.
 3.  Mild CHF, considerably improved compared with ___.  
 4.  No focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.
