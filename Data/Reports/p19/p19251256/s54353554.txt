 HISTORY: Fevers and joint pain for four days.  Concern for bacterial
 infection.  Past history of PPD positive.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted with no prior
 studies for comparison.  The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No nodules identified.  The heart is top normal in size
 but no edema is evident.  No bony abnormality is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Top normal heart size.  No plain film evidence of pneumonia.
