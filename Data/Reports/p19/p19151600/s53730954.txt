                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with bliateral pneumothoraces, pneumoperitoneum now
 status post left chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 18:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with tip terminating
 near the apex.  Previously noted large left pneumothorax has substantially
 reduced in size, with probable small residual pneumothorax noted.  Moderate
 size right pneumothorax is unchanged.  There is persistent atelectasis of both
 lung bases, not substantially changed in the interval.  Extensive
 pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is re- demonstrated as well as
 free intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal air within the upper abdomen. Enteric
 tube tip is coiled within the stomach.  Oral contrast material is noted within
 the stomach.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary
 edema is evident.  No fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left chest tube with marked reduction in size of the
 left pneumothorax, with probable small residual left apical pneumothorax. 
 Persistent moderate right pneumothorax.  Extensive pneumomediastinum,
 subcutaneous emphysema, and intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal air within the
 upper abdomen appear grossly unchanged.
