                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.  Evaluation for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  The lungs are clear, with no evidence of pneumothorax, pulmonary
 edema or focal airspace opacity.  No large pleural effusion is identified. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, best appreciated on the lateral view.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified on the AP and lateral views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  No displaced rib fractures identified on these views; however, assessment
 is limited secondary to body habitus.  If clinical suspicion remains for
 occult rib fracture, dedicated rib series radiographs or chest CT is
 recommended.
