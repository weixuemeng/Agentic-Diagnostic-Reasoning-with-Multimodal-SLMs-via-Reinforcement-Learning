                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The field of view is tailored to visualization of a nasogastric
 tube and does not completely image the lung parenchyma.  A nasogastric tube
 passes into the stomach where it makes a single coil.  To the extent
 visualized, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 The partly visualized left costophrenic sulcus shows slight blunting so there
 may be a small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach, where it makes a
 single coil.  Possible small left-sided pleural effusion but not well
 assessed.
