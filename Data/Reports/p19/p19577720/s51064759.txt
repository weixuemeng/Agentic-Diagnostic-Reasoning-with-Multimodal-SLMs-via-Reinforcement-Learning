 1.  Stable enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median
 sternotomy.  There continue to be massively enlarged pulmonary arteries
 consistent with known underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There are
 likely small bilateral effusions.  However, the pulmonary vascular congestion
 has improved.  There is still patchy opacity at the left base which may
 represent atelectasis given some interval improvement.  No pneumothorax.
