                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, with associated massive enlargement
 of the pulmonary arteries, the latter consistent with known history of
 pulmonary hypertension.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema
 are similar to the recent radiograph, and small bilateral pleural effusions
 are also not substantially changed.  Right retrocardiac opacity may reflect a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion, but underlying infectious
 consolidation is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
