                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a retrocardiac opacity
 obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting a consolidation in the left lower
 lobe.  Air bronchograms are noted within the opacity.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with consolidative pneumonia in the left
 lower lobe.  Followup radiographs are recommended to show resolution after
 treatment in approximately eight weeks.
