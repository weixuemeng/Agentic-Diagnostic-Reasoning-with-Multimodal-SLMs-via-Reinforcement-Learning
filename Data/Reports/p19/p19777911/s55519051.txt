                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left-sided PICC line kinked in the SVC,
 here to reevaluate PICC placement after power flushing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed earlier the same day at 09:51
 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left-sided PICC line is seen doubling
 back on itself within the left brachiocephalic vein at the origin of the SVC. 
 The tip is not visualized as it is likely superimposed upon itself.  An
 oblique view could confirm this or another revision could be attempted. 
 Replacement by a fluoroscopic guidance should be considered.
 
 Inspiratory lung volumes are low.  The lungs are clear without pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent in
 the setting of low lung volumes but unchanged from the preceding radiograph. 
 A calcified mass in the left paratracheal region represents a known thyroid
 abnormality seen on chest CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC line with tip doubling back on itself in the left
 brachiocephalic vein should be repositioned.
