                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML on chemo presenting with fevers,
 inspiratory crackles and LL edema on exam  // PNA vs. cardiogenic edema.    
 PNA vs. cardiogenic edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right central venous line tip is most likely in the right atrium and should be
 pulled back 1.5 cm.  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouette are unchanged. 
 There is interval development of widespread parenchymal opacities, concerning
 for a combination of pulmonary edema and potentially underlying infectious
 process.  Giving the known history of AML in chemotherapy, assessment with
 chest CT is required to exclude the possibility of radiographically occult
 pneumonia in a patient with neutropenic fever.
 
 No change in the substantial calcification in the inferior pole of the left
 thyroid gland is noted.
