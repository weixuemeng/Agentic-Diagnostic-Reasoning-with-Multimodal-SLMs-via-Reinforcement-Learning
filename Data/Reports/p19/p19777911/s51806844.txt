 PICC terminates in the distal SVC.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  The previously seen right basal airspace opacity has now resolved.
 There is persistence of the left basal airspace opacity, this may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or infection.  No pneumothorax seen.  No definite
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement in the right basal consolidation when compared to the prior study,
 persistent left basal consolidation.
