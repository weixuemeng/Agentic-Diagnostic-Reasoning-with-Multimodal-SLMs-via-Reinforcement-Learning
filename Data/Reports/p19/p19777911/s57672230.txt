                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of AML, presents with febrile
 neutropenia, now with new cough and fevers, any evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: Portable chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The left PICC tip is now oriented superiorly
 likely within the azygous and should be pulled back 2 cm to be repositioned
 within the SVC.  Minimal retrocardiac opacification with possible air
 bronchograms is noted which may represent atelectasis; however, infectious
 process such as aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  Low lung volumes are noted bilaterally. Mild cardiomegaly
 is stable. Calcification in the vicinity of the left thyroid lobe is unchanged
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left PICC tip is now oriented superiorly likely within the azygous and
 should be pulled back 2 cm to be repositioned within the SVC.  
 2. Minimal retrocardiac opacification with possible air bronchograms is noted
 which may represent atelectasis; however, infectious process such as
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 Dr. ___ was notified of the results at 11:45am on ___ via
