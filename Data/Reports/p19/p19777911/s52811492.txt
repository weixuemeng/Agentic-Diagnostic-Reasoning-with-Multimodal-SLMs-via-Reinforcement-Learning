                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Pain with deep inspiration and tenderness over the
 PICC line.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are unremarkable.  There is questionable new opacity at the
 left lung that potentially may represent left lower lobe developing infectious
 process, attention to this area on the subsequent study is recommended.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Upper lungs are clear.  Mediastinal
 contour is stable.
