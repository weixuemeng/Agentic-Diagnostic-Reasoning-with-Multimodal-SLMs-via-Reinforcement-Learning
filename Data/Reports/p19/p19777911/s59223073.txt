                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:51 P.M., ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  AML.  Ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans.  New crackles in the
 lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 On ___, there is an unequivocal evidence of volume-related pulmonary
 edema, namely progression of cardiomegaly and caliber of mediastinal and
 pulmonary vessels.  Findings improved but did not resolve entirely by ___, and on ___, there was a generalized worsening and the suggestion of
 early consolidation in the right lower lobe.  The right lower lobe has
 subsequently cleared, there is no longer a pulmonary edema, and the pulmonary
 vasculature and caliber of mediastinal vessels are comparable to the baseline
 appearance on ___.  Nevertheless, there is substantial cardiomegaly
 with particular left atrial enlargement, presumably making the patient prone
 to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. 
 Pleural effusion, minimal if any.  No pneumothorax.
