                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with frequent PVCs, concern for
 irritating PICC tip, PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  A left-sided PICC line is seen to terminate overlying the
 right-sided mediastinal structures at the level 1 cm below the carina.  This
 appears to be a safe distance above the entrance into the right atrium.  The
 lungs are clear without evidence of pulmonary congestion.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement is present and mild elongation of the thoracic aorta is noted.
 
 On the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, the
 same left-sided PICC line reached well into the area of the right atrium and
 withdrawal by at least 3 cm was recommended.  Apparently, this has been
 performed successfully as the line terminates now in safe position in the mid
 portion of the SVC and at least mechanically cannot get in contact with
 cardiac structures.
