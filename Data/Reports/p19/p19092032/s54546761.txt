                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M quad w/ dyspnea, hypoxia, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are noted
 obscuring the hemidiaphragms bilaterally. There appears to be a small right
 pleural effusion. Assessment for a left pleural effusion is limited as the
 left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  No large left
 pleural effusion is demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis but aspiration or infection
 cannot be excluded. Probable small right pleural effusion.  Exclusion of the
 left costophrenic angle.
