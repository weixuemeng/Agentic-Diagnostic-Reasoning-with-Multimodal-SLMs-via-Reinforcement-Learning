                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  A subtle left base retrocardiac opacity most
 likely represents atelectasis and confluence of vessels; however, an early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy posterior left lower lobe opacity, most likely
 represents atelectasis and overlap of vascular structures, although infection
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
