                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Erosion of chemoport site.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 4.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild prominence to the interstitium, which would most commonly be due
 to mild fluid overload.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable. Surgical clips again project over the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Intact appearance of port tubing without discontinuity.  Mild nonspecific
 interstitial abnormality but suggestive of vascular congestion.
