                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, not significantly changed from
 the prior study. Left basilar/retrocardiac opacitites have increased since the
 prior which could be due to atelctasis or infection.  There is blunting of the
 costophrenic angle on the left, which likely represents a small pleural
 effusion.  The right costophenic angle is excluded, but a small right effusion
 is suspected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and superimposed left basilar/retrocardiac
 opacitites have increased since the prior which could be due to atelctasis or
 infection.
