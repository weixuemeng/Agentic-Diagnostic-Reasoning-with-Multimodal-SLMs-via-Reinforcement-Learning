                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___-year-old man with fever, emesis, history of congestive
 heart failure, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single-view chest x-ray in upright position shows interval
 improvement of pulmonary edema, but new right lung base opacity due to
 atelectasis, probably in the right middle lobe.  Left lung base opacity has
 improved, probably for reduced atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  Stable aortosclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of pulmonary edema with better ventilation
 of the left lung base, but new right lung base opacity compatible with right
 middle lobe atelectasis.
