                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 Several radiographs of the chest obtained consecutively were brought to our
 review demonstrating the process of insertion of the NG tube.
 
 The last radiograph demonstrates the NG tube tip being in the stomach.  Heart
 size and mediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasal opacities are overall
 unchanged.  No development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
