 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath, edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged the aorta is unfolded.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated with vascular indistinctness and perihilar haziness.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could suggest a trace left
 pleural effusion.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with possible trace left pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
