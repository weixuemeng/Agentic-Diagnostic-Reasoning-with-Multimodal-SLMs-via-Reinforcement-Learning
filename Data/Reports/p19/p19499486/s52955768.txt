                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall and rib pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of emphysema.  An ill
 defined right infrahilar opacity abutting the right cardiac sillhouette
 without obscuring it is not seen in the lateral view. No other focal opacities
 are identified.  Biapical pleuro-parenchymal scarring is present. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. No rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right infrahilar opacity is not clearly seen in the lateral view and may
 represent a focus of consolidation such as atelectasis/pneumonia versus
 summation of structures. Correlate clinically.
 2.  No evidence of rib fractures.  Of note, this study has suboptimal
 sensitivity for the detection of rib fractures and dedicated rib series or
 chest CT are more sensitive.
