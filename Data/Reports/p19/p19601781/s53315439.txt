                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever.  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  VP shunt tubing traverses
 the left hemi thorax.  Lung volumes are low though allowing for this, there is
 no definite evidence for pneumonia, edema, effusion or pneumothorax.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular markings in the lower lungs and perihilar region does limit
 the evaluation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  VP shunt tubing crosses the left hemi thorax.
