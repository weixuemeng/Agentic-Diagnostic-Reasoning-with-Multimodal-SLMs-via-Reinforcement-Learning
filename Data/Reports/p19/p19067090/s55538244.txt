                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and bronchial breath sounds, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinct
 pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Basilar
 opacification persist, especially on the left, is most consistent with
 atelectasis and effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
