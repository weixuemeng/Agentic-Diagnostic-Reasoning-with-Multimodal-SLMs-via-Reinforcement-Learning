                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, cough.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. 
 Bibasilar opacity is likely atelectasis larger on the left.  Pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.
