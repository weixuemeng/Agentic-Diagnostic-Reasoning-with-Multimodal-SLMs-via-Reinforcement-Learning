 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, questionable right lower lobe crackles, evaluation for

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The pre-existing diaphragmatic eventration on the right has mildly

 lung base.  On the lateral radiograph, this translates into an area of
 increased radiodensity on the lateral radiograph, corresponding to the region
 of the middle lobe.  If consistent with the clinical history, these findings
 would strongly suggest the presence of pneumonia.  At the time of observation
 and dictation, at 5:04 p.m., on ___, the referring physician, ___.
