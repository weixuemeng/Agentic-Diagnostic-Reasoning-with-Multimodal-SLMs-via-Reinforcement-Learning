                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pneumonia, chills.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate a vague
 opacity at the right lung base which could represent superimposed
 bronchovascular structures though the possibility of pneumonia is not
 excluded.  Correlate with physical exam.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat irregular opacity at the right lung base could represent
 overlapping bronchovascular structures though correlation with exam to exclude
 pneumonia. Consider repeat exam with oblique projections.
