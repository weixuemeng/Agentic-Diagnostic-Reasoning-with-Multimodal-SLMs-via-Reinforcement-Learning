                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube closely approaches the
 carinal within about 1 cm.  An orogastric tube passes into the stomach on and
 terminates there.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 The lung volumes are decreased with patchy left basilar opacity which is
 probably due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  Low-lying endotracheal tube, although at
 the time of this dictation, it had already been retracted on a subsequent
 film.  Left basilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis.  Attention in
 follow-up is suggested.
