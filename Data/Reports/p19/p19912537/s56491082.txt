                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are
 noted within the right lung base, more pronounced when compared to the
 previous exam. Nodular opacity measuring 6 mm is re- demonstrated within the
 right mid lung field. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No overt
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening patchy opacity in the right lung base, potentially worsening
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
