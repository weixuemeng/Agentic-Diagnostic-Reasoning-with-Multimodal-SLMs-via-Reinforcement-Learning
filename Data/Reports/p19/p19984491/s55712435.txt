                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall with small SDH, on Coumadin for AVR unclear
 if bioprosthetic or mechanical  // characterize aortic valve replacement
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Sternotomy wires are noted.  Linear opacities in the bilateral lower lobes
 likely represent bibasilar atelectasis versus scarring.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aortic arch and descending
 thoracic aorta.  No radiopaque cardiac valve is seen.  S-shaped curvature of
 the thoracolumbar spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No radio opaque cardiac valve is seen.
