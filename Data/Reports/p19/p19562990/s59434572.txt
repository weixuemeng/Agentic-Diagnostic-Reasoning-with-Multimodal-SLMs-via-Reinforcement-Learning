 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. On the lateral view, there is equivocal opacity
 projecting over the posterior lung base, not well substantiated on the frontal
 view. Findings could be due to atelectasis although an underlying
 consolidation is not entirely excluded.
