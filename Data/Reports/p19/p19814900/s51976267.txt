                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 lesser inspiratory effort.  As a consequence, the lung volumes are lower and
 there is crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at the lung bases. 
 However, there is no evidence of pneumonia or other acute lung disease. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
