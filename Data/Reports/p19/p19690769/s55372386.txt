                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC and SOB  // please assess for pulmonary
 edema, worsening pna, or pleural effusion.      please assess for pulmonary
 edema, worsening pna, or pleural
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at 11:16
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left PICC line is unchanged in position. The lytic left fourth rib lesion
 is stable and the lytic lesions in the left humeral head are not well
 visualized on the current study.  The interstitial edema has improved.
 However, more focal patchy opacities are now overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. Seen in the left lower lung, right lower lung and in
 the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure.  Although these findings
 could represent residual edema, multifocal pneumonia should also be
 considered.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.
