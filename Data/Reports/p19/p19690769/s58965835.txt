                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Likely metastatic CA, post-op day 2 status post corpectomy,
 persistent O2 requirement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution and vascular plethora, suggesting mild fluid overload.  There
 is increased patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region, similar, but more
 pronounced, than on the earlier film.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly
 elevated.  No gross effusion identified.  Apparent right convex scoliosis
 centered in the upper thoracic spine.  Ovoid lucency in the left femoral head
 medially is concerning for a lytic lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular plethora, increased compared with ___.
 
 2.  Patchy left base opacity also increased, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation or an area of aspiration.
 
 3.  Lytic lesion left proximal humerus.  This is more completely depicted on
 left shoulder radiographs dated ___.
