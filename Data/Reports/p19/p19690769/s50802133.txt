 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o Renal cell cancer and recent L1-l4
 laminectomy coming in with pancytopenia and recent treatment of HCAP with IV
 abx.  // Assess pic line placement     Assess pic line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 18:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC. There continues to be
 bilateral interstitial prominence and patchy opacity at the left base. When
 compared to prior studies dating back to ___, the interstitial
 abnormality appears somewhat more prominent which likely reflects a component
 of superimposed interstitial edema. The expansile lytic lesion of the left
 lateral fourth anterior rib is again seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours remain stable with the heart being enlarged. No pneumothorax is
 appreciated. Spinal hardware is incompletely visualized overlying the lower
 thoracic spine.
