                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic RCC with spine and lung mets, now with confusion, cough,
 lower back pain and weakness, question pneumonia, pulmonary edema, heart size.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is new opacity in the mid zone and new
 areas of opacity at the right and left bases medially.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.  Extensive severe background COPD and
 hyperinflation are again noted.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 vascular plethora, without definite CHF.  Rounded density along the left chest
 wall is again seen, compatible with a known left fourth rib osseous
 metastasis.  Triangular density in the perihilar left mid zone is new, likely
 enlarged, but not clearly changed.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Small sclerotic density in the right proximal humeral metaphysis is
 nonspecific in appearance and could represent a bone island -- this appearance
 would be atypical for renal carcinoma metastases, which are typically lytic. 
 There is only partial imaging of the upper edge of the posterior spine
 fixation hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and background advanced COPD.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities at both bases medially are new and the possibility of an
 infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.  
 
 3.  Focal density in the posterior portion of the anterior mediastinum
 anterior to the hila is noted, no correlate is convincingly identified on the
 lateral view, possibly a projection of the known rib metastases.  
 
 4.  No new compression fracture is detected.
 
 5.  Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF. 
 No gross effusion.
 
 6.  Only partial imaging of known spinal fixation hardware.
 
 7.  Known pulmonary and osseous metastasis and more effectively demonstrated
 on a chest CT from ___.
