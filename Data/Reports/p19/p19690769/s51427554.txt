                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new onset numbness and weakness of legs
 concerning for spinal stenosis.  Preop CXR  // Intrathoracic process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 within normal limits. Prominence of the hila bilaterally reflects borderline
 enlarged pulmonary arteries.  Lungs are hyperinflated with severe
 emphysematous changes again noted.  Scarring within the lung apices is more
 pronounced on the right.  No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted. Previously seen
 pulmonary nodules on CT are not as well visualized on the current exam. 5 cm
 rounded opacity projecting over the left mid lung field is compatible with
 known osseous metastasis of the left fourth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known pulmonary and osseous metastases are better assessed on the prior CT. No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Severe emphysema.
