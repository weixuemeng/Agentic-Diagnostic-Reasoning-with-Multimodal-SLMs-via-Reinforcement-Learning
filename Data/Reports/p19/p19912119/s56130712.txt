                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post ascending aortic aneurysm
 replacement, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy and aortic vascular
 repair as before.  Appearance of superior mediastinal structures has not
 changed during the latest interval, and no pneumothorax has developed.  Heart
 size remains unchanged and no pulmonary vascular congestive pattern is
 identified.  Comparing the frontal views with the previous examination
 demonstrates that a right-sided pleural effusion has developed which mildly
 blunts the lateral pleural sinus.  Also slight increase of left-sided lateral
 pleural sinus blunting is noted.  When comparing the findings on the lateral
 views, the previously present pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate with
 atelectatic component in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe has
 disappeared.  There remains evidence of small pleural effusions extending into
 both posterior pleural sinuses.  No pneumothorax can be identified on the
 frontal view in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The amount of bilateral pleural effusion matches that found on
 most recent chest CT of ___.
