 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of pleuritic chest pain, recent chest trauma,
 rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer device is again
 seen, with one lead extending to the expected position of the right atrium. 
 The second lead which extends more inferior is not well evaluated due to
 underpenetration.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac
 enlargement persists, although appears minimally less prominent as compared to
 the prior study.  No definite pleural effusion is seen.  There is minimal
 central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 vascular congestion.
