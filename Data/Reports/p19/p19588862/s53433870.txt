                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presenting with bleeding at PICC site.  Evaluate positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show a right PICC terminating in
 the upper SVC.  In comparison to the prior exam on ___, it may be
 slightly pulled back, although exact amount of change is difficult to tell
 based on differences in angulation and patient positioning.
 
 Basilar atelectasis is unchanged from the prior exam.  Small focal opacity at
 the right lung base was not present on prior or on CT torso from ___ and
 most likely represents overlapping structures; developing consolidation not
 excluded in the appropriate setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  PICC in the upper SVC, possibly pulled back slightly from the prior exam,
 although evaluating for change is difficult giving different angulation of
 radiograph in patient positioning.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis. Small focal opacity at the right lung base
 most likely represents overlapping structures; developing consolidation not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
