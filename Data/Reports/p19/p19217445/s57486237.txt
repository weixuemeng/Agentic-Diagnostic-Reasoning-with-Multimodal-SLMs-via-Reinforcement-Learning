                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and weakness, assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 Examination is limited due to poor penetration and low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The heart is
 enlarged with otherwise normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study without acute intrathoracic process.
