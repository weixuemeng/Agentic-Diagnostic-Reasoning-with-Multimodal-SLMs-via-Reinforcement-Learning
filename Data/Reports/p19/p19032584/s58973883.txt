                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, CHF.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in positioning, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 The NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm.  Right subclavian central line tip
 is unchanged, near the SVC/RA junction.  
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, probable background hyperinflation/COPD, and a
 relatively dense opacification in the right lung.  Hazy density in the left
 lung could reflect layering effusion.  There is increased retrocardiac density
 consistent, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged. 
 There is some more patchy opacity at the left upper zone and ? at the right
 upper zone raising the question of background parenchymal scarring.
 
 Incidental note is made of a focal sclerotic density in the left glenoid, ?
 bone island.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant change compared with one day earlier.
