                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia, recent volume overload.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared to the prior study, the overall appearance is not significantly
 changed.  Again seen is an NG tube extending beneath the diaphragm off the
 film and a right subclavian PICC line with tip near distal SVC/RA junction. 
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Enlarged right hilum. 
 There is patchy opacity in both lungs, question infectious infiltrate. 
 However, the differential diagnosis includes atypical distribution of CHF. 
 Hazy opacity at both lung bases is consistent with bilateral effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant change compared with one day earlier.  Opacity
 at the left base appears slightly more pronounced than on a film from
 ___, but this appearance is likely accentuated by differences in
 positioning.
