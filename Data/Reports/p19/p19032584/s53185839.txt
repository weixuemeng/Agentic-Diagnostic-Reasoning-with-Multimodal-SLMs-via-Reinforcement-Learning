                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with wheezing  // r/o pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR performed on ___, the patient has been extubated.
 The right sided PICC line is unchanged in position and terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 The moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear to have worsened, but this may
 be exaggerated by post-extubation lung volume loss. Mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema has improved. No pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.
 Other than a possible old left 9th rib fracture, there are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear worse, but this may be exaggerated by
 post-extubation volume loss.
 2.  Improving mild interstitial edema.
