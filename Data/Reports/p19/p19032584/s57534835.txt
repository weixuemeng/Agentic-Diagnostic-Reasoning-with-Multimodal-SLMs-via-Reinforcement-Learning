                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man newly intubated. Evaluate ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent film performed
 approximately 1 hr prior to this exam.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that ends
 approximately 5 cm above the carinal. A right-sided PICC line ends in the
 lower SVC in unchanged position.
 
 There has been no significant interval change in appearance of the lungs
 compared with the previous exam, with a diffuse alveolar process that appears
 to have the same distribution observed in prior CT from ___. The more
 pronouced right basal opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and a
 large layering pleural effusion. A small left-sided pleural effusion with
 probable associated atelectasis is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube ends beyond the thoracic inlet in appropriate position
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.
 
 2. Persistent diffuse alveolar process better assessed in recent CT from
 ___ is not resolving and suggestive of multifocal pneumonia with
 underlying interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, right
 worse than left, are unchanged.
