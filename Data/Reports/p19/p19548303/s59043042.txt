                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is relative hyperlucency of the upper and mid
 zones on both sides, suggesting severe emphysema.  There is slight upper zone
 redistribution.  There are patchy opacities at both lung bases.  This may
 reflect crowding of vessels at the lung bases due to emphysematous changes. 
 However, it is more pronounced, particularly on the left, compared with
 ___ and ___.  Thus, the possibility of superimposed infectious
 infiltrate cannot be excluded.  Asymmetric distribution of CHF is considered
 less likely.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is grossly unchanged. 
 Vertical linear lucency in the left paratracheal region adjacent to the aortic
 knob is similar to ___ and therefore unlikely to represent
 pneumomediastinum.  Otherwise, no evidence of pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe emphysema with vascular crowding/scarring at bases.
 
 2.  Opacity at left greater than right base is more pronounced compared to
 prior films and raises question of a superimposed pneumonic infiltrate,
 particularly at the left base.  Please see comment.
