  1. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate interstitial
  pulmonary edema with moderate to severe cardiomegaly and likely small
  bilateral pleural effusions.
  2. Retrocardiac opacification may represent lobar pneumonia or pulmonary mass.
  Given the extensive parenchymal changes nonemergent chest CT is recommended
  for clarification.
  3. Severe hyperexpansion consistent with COPD.
  4. Acute to subacute anterior left eighth rib fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, likely choledocholithiasis evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe hyperexpansion is consistent with underlying COPD.  There is moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion and associated mild to moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  A mildly displaced
 anterior left eighth rib fracture is acute or subacute.  Dextroscoliosis of
 the lower thoracic spine is severe.  There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly
 and tortuosity of the descending aorta.  There is focal eventration and
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Demineralization is moderate to severe. 
 Allowing for scoliosis, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema with moderate to severe cardiomegaly and likely small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Severe hyperexpansion consistent with COPD.
 3. Acute to subacute anterior left eighth rib fracture in its lateral aspect
 without significant displacement.
 
 4. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, projecting over the lower thoracic
 ribs on the lateral view, better defined on the subsequent CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The fact that a Chest CT is no longer recommended was paged to
 ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on ___ at 10:03 AM, 8
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
