                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT from ___ and radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including fullness
 of the upper mediastinal contour to the left of midline, reflecting a combined
 shadow of the aorta and main pulmonary artery, which is probably borderline
 enlarged.  This area did not show involvement for malignancy on the prior
 PET-CT but the trachea does appear splayed somewhat more towards the right
 with a more horizontal configuration to the left main stem bronchus. 
 Possibly, this could indicate developing mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  An
 irregular mass at the left lung apex appears unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique.  Streaky opacities at the left lung base indicates
 minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 There are three new mild compression deformities since remote prior
 radiographs from ___, although somewhat difficult to compare to
 more recent studies such as radiographs from ___, although the
 indication is that at least the lower two, which probably relate to the T10
 and T11 vertebral bodies, are new since ___ and similar but more
 likely increased since the more recent PET-CT dated ___.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Mild change in the configuration of the mediastinum, which raises concern
 for developing lymphadenopathy.
 
 3.  Several mild compression fractures of the thoracic spine, the lower two of
 which (probably involving T10 and T11), likely acute or subacute.
