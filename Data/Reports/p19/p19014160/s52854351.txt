                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diverticulitis, alc hep, hep A and B spiking
 fevers  // e/o PNA or other acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Positioning on the lateral view is limited by slight rotation.
 
 Allowing for this, minimal patchy opacity at the left base likely represents
 atelectasis.  An early infiltrate is considered much less likely.
 
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without focal infiltrate,
 consolidation, or effusion.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  No CHF is detected.  Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.
 
 A small (7 mm) ovoid density projecting over the right scapula near the
 coracoid process could represent a small loose body or focus of
 hydroxyapatite.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing infectious infiltrate identified.  Minimal patchy opacity at the
 left base is non-specific and could represent minimal atelectasis.
 
 Otherwise, no evidence of acute pulmonary process.
