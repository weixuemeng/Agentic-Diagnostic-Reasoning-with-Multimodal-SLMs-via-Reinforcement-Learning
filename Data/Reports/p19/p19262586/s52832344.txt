                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, post chest tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, a right-sided chest tube has been placed.  The lung
 appears to have expanded essentially completely.  The previously seen right
 apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized.  Minimal atelectasis at the right
 base remains present, improved.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Degenerative changes of both
 shoulders noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with reexpansion of
 the lung.  No pneumothorax identified on the current film.
