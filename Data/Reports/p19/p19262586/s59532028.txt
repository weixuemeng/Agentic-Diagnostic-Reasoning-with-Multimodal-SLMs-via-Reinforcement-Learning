                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung mass with anemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of large
 posterior right upper lobe opacity.  Findings are concerning for pneumonia. 
 In the prior chest CT from ___, a 14 mm spiculated nodule is seen in
 the posterior right upper lob; conceivable but much less likely, there may
 have been quite significant growth of the nodule in the interval.  Also,
 correlate with any history of intervening procedure.  Right paratracheal
 opacity with leftward indentation of the trachea is consistent with patient's
 known enlarged right lobe of the thyroid.  No large pleural effusion is seen
 in the small amount of pleural fluid along the right lung apex is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and
 slightly tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large posterior right upper lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.  On
 prior chest CT from ___, a 14 mm spiculated nodule is in the posterior
 right upper lob; conceivable but much less likely quite significant growth of
 the nodule in the interval.  Also, correlate with any history of intervening
 procedure.  The large posterior right upper lobe opacity was not seen on chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 Right paratracheal opacity with leftward deviation of the trachea again seen,
 consistent with patient's known enlarged right lobe of thyroid.
