                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, rales.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change.
 The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size with
 tortuosity of the aorta, but no evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no acute
 focal pneumonia.
