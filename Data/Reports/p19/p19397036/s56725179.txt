                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, sudden oxygen desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild increase in
 diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, likely to reflect mild overhydration. 
 These changes are most evident in the left perihilar regions and at the right
 lung base.  There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions and no
 pneumothorax.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices except for the fact
 that one of the nasogastric devices has been removed.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
