                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating between ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right hemidiaphragm contour is markedly elevated to the level of
 the right hilum.  The degree of right hemidiaphragm elevation has increased
 since ___ and was at a normal level on ___ chest
 radiograph.  There is adjacent atelectasis at the right lung base.  Heart size
 is normal.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 Surgical clips are present in the left paraspinal region.  Feeding tube
 terminates below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening right diaphragmatic elevation, possibly due to known
 history of large volume ascites.  A coexisting subpulmonic effusion cannot be
 excluded radiographically but there is no evidence of effusion on concurrent
 ultrasound exam.
