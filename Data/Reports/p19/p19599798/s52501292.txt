                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta shows
 mild unfolding and calcification along the arch.  The lung volumes are low. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacity, unchanged, probably atelectasis,
 without clear evidence for pneumonia.
