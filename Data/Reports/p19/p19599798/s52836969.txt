                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left sided crackles  // ??infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 22:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Again seen is mild cardiomegaly, with a calcified ascending aorta
 
 There is patchy relatively confluent opacity at the right lung base extending
 to the costophrenic sulcus.  , new compared with ___.  No
 associated air bronchograms are identified, however.
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or effusion.  No CHF.
 
 Thin vertical linear lucency along the mid left chest wall is noted, new
 compared with the prior study.  This may represent artifact due to out
 overlying soft tissues.  An atypical pneumothorax along the left mid chest
 wall is considered less likely.  No other evidence of pneumothorax.  Probable
 old healed left sided rib fractures noted, unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New confluent opacity at the right lung base, suspicious for a focal pneumonic
 infiltrate.  A small associated effusion would be difficult to exclude.  If
 clinically indicated, a lateral view could help for further characterization.
 
 Minimal,  if any, left base atelectasis.  No left base consolidation or
 effusion.
 
 Thin linear lucency abutting the inner surface of the left mid chest wall.  Is
 there clinical concern for a pneumothorax in this location?  .  This
 appearance is more suggestive of artifact due to overlying soft tissue planes.
 No other evidence of pneumothorax.
