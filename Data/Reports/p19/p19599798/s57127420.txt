                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SDH, IVH, now focal motor status
 epilepticus, AMS.  // Rule out infectious cause.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior study the lung volumes are lower.  There is a right pleural
 effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  A consolidation in this
 region cannot be excluded.  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Stable
 calcification of the ascending aorta and aortic arch.  There is calcification
 noted in the left carotid artery and right rotator cuff.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the right lower lung may represent worsening pleural
 effusion and compression atelectasis.  However in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
