  1.  Limited evaluation of the ribs due to overlying structures.  However, no
  definite acute rib fracture detected.
  
  2.  Re demonstration of diffusely increased interstitial lung markings,
  compatible with progression of known chronic interstitial lung disease. 
  Again, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may also represent atypical
  infection or a component of interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, eye brow lac.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.  Chest CT of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, lung volumes are slightly lower.  Diffusely
 increased interstitial lung markings are again seen, compatible with known
 history of chronic interstitial lung disease.  Evaluation of the ribs is
 limited by overlying structures, however there does not appear to be any
 evidence of acute rib fracture.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 since the prior study.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative
 changes of the glenohumeral and AC joints are similar.  Similar appearance of
 the rightward deviated trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Limited evaluation of the ribs due to overlying structures.  However, no
 definite acute rib fracture detected.
 
 2.  Re demonstration of diffusely increased interstitial lung markings,
 compatible with progression of known chronic interstitial lung disease. 
 Again, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may also represent atypical
 infection or a component of interstitial edema.
