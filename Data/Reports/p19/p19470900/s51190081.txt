                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis with posterior fossa hemorrhage status post posterior
 decompression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  An
 endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with the tip terminating 4 cm
 cranial to the carina.  A right subclavian approach central venous catheter is
 in place with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged with moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  A persistent focus of asymmetric density in the right
 upper lung is slightly worse compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Unchanged moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 2.  Slight increase in asymmetric right upper lung opacities are likely
 asymmetric edema; however, concurrent infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
