                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and leukocytosis, rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Bilateral subtle areas of opacities that might be atelectatic, but
 might also reflect early pneumonia and, thus, could be consistent with the
 clinical presentation.  The lateral radiograph is technically limited and does
 not allow to narrow the differential diagnosis.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 evidence of pleural effusions.
