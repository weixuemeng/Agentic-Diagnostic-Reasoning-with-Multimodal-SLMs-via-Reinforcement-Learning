  Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation.  Hazy bibasilar opacities and a right
  upper lobe opacity are nonspecific, and may be atelectasis related to low lung
  volumes.  A pneumonia is difficult to completely exclude.  If possible,
  recommend a PA/lateral view in full inspiration for further characterization.
