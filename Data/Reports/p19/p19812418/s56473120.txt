 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with mediastinal bleeding post-op  // eval for
 effusion, widened mediastinum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed 6 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube has been withdrawn now in appropriate position.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with
 increasing atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.  Widening mediastinum has improved.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis have also increased.  No other interval change from prior study.
