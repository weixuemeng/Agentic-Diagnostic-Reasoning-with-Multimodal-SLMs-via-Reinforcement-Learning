                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AVR/MVR/TVr  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is again seen a left-sided central line with the distal lead tip in the
 proximal right atrium.  There are low lung volumes which limits evaluation of
 the lung bases.  Allowing for this, there remains a left retrocardiac opacity
 and atelectasis at both lung bases.  There is likely an element of fluid
 overload, stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
