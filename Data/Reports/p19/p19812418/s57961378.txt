 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath  // pulmonary edema vs
 infiltrate      pulmonary edema vs infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 have been removed.  There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette but
 improvement in the pulmonary vascular status with only minimal elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe with small
 pleural effusion.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour persists.
