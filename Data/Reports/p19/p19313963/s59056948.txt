                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS and IMPRESSION: A severe scoliosis limits the evaluation of the heart
 size, although, it appears unchanged.  There is peribronchovascular
 opacification within the right low lung, perhaps reflecting aspiration or a
 resolving pneumonia. This is unlikely to account for symptoms.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Unusual
 posterior spinal fusion hardware is unchanged in appearance.  The mediastinum
 is unremarkable.  Clips are seen within the right upper quadrant.  No free air
 is seen.
