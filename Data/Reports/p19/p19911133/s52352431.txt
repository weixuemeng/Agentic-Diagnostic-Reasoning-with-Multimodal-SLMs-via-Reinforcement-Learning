                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new right IJ line placement, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to a prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacemaker remains in place.  Persistent retrocardiac
 opacification with an associated effusion likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Smaller right effusion is likely present.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable given patient's rotation to the left on the current
 examination.  Calcification in the aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Interval placement of right internal jugular
 central line with its tip in the distal SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
