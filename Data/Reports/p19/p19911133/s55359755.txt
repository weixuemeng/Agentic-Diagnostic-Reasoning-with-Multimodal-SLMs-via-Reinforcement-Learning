                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:02 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with heart failure, hypoxia, fever, question
 pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:02 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line unchanged in position.  A left-sided
 pacemaker unchanged.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation and a layering
 effusion.  The airspace consolidation most likely represents partial lower
 lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Streaky opacities at the right base likely reflect patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration should also be considered.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.
