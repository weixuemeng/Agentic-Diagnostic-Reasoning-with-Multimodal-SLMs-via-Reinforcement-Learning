                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle is unchanged.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged,
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted.  Diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aorta are seen.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  Small left pleural effusion is relatively similar
 compared to the prior study, as is a tiny right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 left greater than right.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis though
 infection is difficult to exclude.
