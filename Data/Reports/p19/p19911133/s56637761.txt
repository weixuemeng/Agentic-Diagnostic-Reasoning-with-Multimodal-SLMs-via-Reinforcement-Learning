                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions. Right pleural effusion with probable subpulmonic component.  Left
 lung base consolidation is noted.  Right lung base opacities are also seen. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to assess due to the
 adjacent opacities, which is likely enlarged.  Aortic arch calcifications are
 noted.  Pacemaker leads are in place, projecting over right atrium and
 ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Left
 lung base consolidation, likely atelectasis, however, superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
