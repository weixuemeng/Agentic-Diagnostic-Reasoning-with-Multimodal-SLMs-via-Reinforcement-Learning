                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, fever, cough and new oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted in the left chest with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta is noted.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs appear mildly
 hyperinflated.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen.  Left basilar
 opacification is noted, with a small left pleural effusion .  No pneumothorax
 is seen, and there is no right-sided pleural effusion.  Loss of height of
 several thoracic vertebral bodies is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis or infection, with
 adjacent small left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Multiple compression fractures in the thoracic spine, of indeterminate
 chronicity.
