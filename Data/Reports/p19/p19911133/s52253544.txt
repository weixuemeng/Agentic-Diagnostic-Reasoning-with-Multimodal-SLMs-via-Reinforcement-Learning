                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with diastolic CHF with chest pain,
 found to have possible retrocardiac opacity, evaluate for pulmonary edema and
 atelectasis versus pneumonia in retrocardiac area.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP chest examination of
 ___.  Position of permanent pacer connected to two intracavitary
 electrodes is unchanged.  Significant cardiac enlargement as seen before.  The
 pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has improved slightly with less marked
 perivascular haze.  Bilateral pleural effusions persist, more marked on the
 left than the right.  There is no evidence of acute pulmonary parenchymal
 pneumonic infiltrates, however, size of the left-sided pleural effusion does
 not permit exclusion of such process in the lower lobe area.  Review of
 multiple previous chest examinations beginning with ___
 indicates that the patient has chronic left-sided heart failure with episode
 of most marked pulmonary congestion occurring on ___. 
 Previously suggested retrocardiac density (___) may reflect
 atelectasis.  If this represents pulmonary infection must be decided on
 clinical grounds.
