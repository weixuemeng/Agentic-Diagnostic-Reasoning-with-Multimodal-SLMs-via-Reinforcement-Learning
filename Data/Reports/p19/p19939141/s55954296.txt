                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the upper to mid SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  A right-sided catheter courses vertically over the chest and
 into the abdomen most likely representing a VP shunt.  Subtle patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity appears less prominent as compared the prior study may
 represent atelectasis rather than pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  Tracheostomy tube is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pulmonary edema.  Left base retrocardiac opacity is less prominent as
 compared to the prior study and may represent atelectasis rather than
 pneumonia.
