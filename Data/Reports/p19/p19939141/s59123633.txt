                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever,  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC terminates in the low SVC tracheostomy tube is in adequate
 position.  VP shunt traverses the right hemithorax.  Bibasilar opacities may
 reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Findings are more pronounced on the
 left than the right.  Mid upper lungs appear well aerated.  No convincing
 evidence for effusion or pneumothorax on this supine radiograph. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia, left greater
 than right.
