                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at ___:___ from___.  Chest
 radiograph ___ from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is evidence of right lung volume loss with tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm and opacification in the right apex compatible prior right upper
 lobectomy.  Ill-defined focal opacification within the right upper lung field
 appears progressed compared to the prior radiograph from ___ but
 is unchanged compared to the radiograph performed earlier the same day.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Degenerative changes are seen within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 IStatus post right upper lobectomy with ill-defined opacification within the
 right upper lung field which could reflect post treatment changes, though
 infection or neoplasm is not excluded.  Comparison with prior cross sectional
 imaging is recommended, and if none are available, a dedicated chest CT is
 suggested.
