                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer, malignant pericardial and pleural
 effusions and constrictive pericarditis, assess pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 19:14 p.m.
 
 A right-sided indwelling catheter with tip over upper RA is unchanged.
 
 Compared to the prior study, I doubt significant interval change.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and small left effusion, with left base
 atelectasis, are unchanged.  Again seen is an opacity over the right mid/lower
 zone, which is unchanged, and which presumably relates to the patient's
 right-sided breast implant.  Right paratracheal density and
 right-greater-than-left apical pleural scarring is unchanged and likely
 represents post-radiation changes.    
 
 Fracture of the sternum, with depression superiorly, is similar to prior. 
 Possible fracture of the right twelfth rib is also unchanged.  Multiple
 sclerotic bony foci and pulmonary nodules seen on a CT from ___ are less
 apparent radiographically.
 
 Previously seen air-distended hepatic flexure is nondistended on today's exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change identified compared with ___.  Fracture
 of the sternum, with slight depression superiorly, is again noted.
