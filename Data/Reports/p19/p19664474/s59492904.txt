                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Breast cancer on chemotherapy with exertional angina
 and effusions on chest x-ray outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided central venous catheter is seen, Port-A-Cath,
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  Relative
 opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower hemithorax may relate to a
 breast implant, correlate for history of such.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  On the lateral view, there is a sclerosis along
 the inferior aspect of the sternum likely due to metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacity projecting over the right
 mid-to-lower hemithorax may relate to breast implant.  Correlate for history
 of such.  No definite focal consolidation seen.  Sclerosis and fragmentation
 along the sternum likely due to metastasis.
