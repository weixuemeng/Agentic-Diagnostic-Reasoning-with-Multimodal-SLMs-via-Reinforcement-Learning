                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough x 2 week  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  The heart is not enlarged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared with ___.  Mild
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No focal infiltrate or effusion
 is detected.
 
 The left anterior seventh rib has an unusual configuration, in that the
 superior border/ cortex is indistinct, new compared with ___.  Other
 visualized ribs are within normal limits.  Mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process.  In particular, no pneumonic infiltrate
 identified.
 2. Unusual appearance to the anterior left seventh rib, with indistinctness of
 the superior border of the rib.  While this may represent an unusual artifact,
 it raises the possibility of a lytic area in the rib.  Correlation with
 physical exam to assess for any focal tenderness or mass in this location is
 requested.
