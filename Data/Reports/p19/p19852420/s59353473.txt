                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded.  There is no focal opacity or pulmonary
 edema.  There is a small right pleural effusion. There is no left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise normal.  The bones are diffusely demineralized with
 multiple compression deformities in the thoracic spine, which are likely
 chronic, though no prior exams are available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperexpanded lungs and small right pleural effusion. No evidence of
 pneumonia.
