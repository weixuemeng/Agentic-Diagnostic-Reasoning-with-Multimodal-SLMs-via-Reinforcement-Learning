                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with worsening tachycardia, rising lactate  //
 presence of developing PNA      presence of developing PNA
 Worsening tachycardia and rising lactate. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Possible developing opacity in the right midlung zone. This may represents a
 pneumonia. Recommend short interval followup with a repeat chest radiograph in
 12 hours.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded. There is a possible developing opacity in the
 right mid lung zone. There is no pulmonary edema. Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is likely due to the small pleural effusion, which was
 better assessed on the lateral chest radiograph from one day earlier. There is
 no definite left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The slight apparent enlargement of the
 heart is likely due to the AP technique.
