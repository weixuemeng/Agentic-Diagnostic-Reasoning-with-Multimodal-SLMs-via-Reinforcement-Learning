                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o female with a past medical history of moderate to severe
 AS, dCHF (EF ___%), HTN, DMII, and CKD IV (Cr 1.6-1.9) who presented to an OSH
 with acute CHF exacerbation was transferred to ___ for TAVR evaluation with
 worsening SOB  // eval for worsening pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread parenchymal opacities appear to be unchanged as compared to most
 recent prior study obtained at 22:16 the day before.  No new consolidations
 demonstrated. The abnormalities are most likely representing infectious
 process or interstitial lung disease and unlikely to represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  As previously suggested correlation with chest CT would be
 beneficial
