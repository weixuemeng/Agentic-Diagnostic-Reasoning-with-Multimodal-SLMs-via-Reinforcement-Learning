                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with respiratory distress. Evaluate for CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, heterogeneous opacities in the right upper and
 lower lungs have worsened, resulting in more confluent consolidation.
 Additionally, new retrocardiac opacity may represent worsening atelectasis or
 infection.  Superimposed pulmonary edema is likely. Heart size and mediastinal
 contour is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening in consolidation of the right lung, as well as new
 consolidation at left lung base. Findings are concerning for multifocal
 infection.  Superimposed pulmonary edema is also likely.
