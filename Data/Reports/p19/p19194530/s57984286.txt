 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of CHF and aortic stenosis presents
 with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is similar. There
 is mild pulmonary edema with pulmonary vascular indistinctness and perihilar
 haziness, more progressed in the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions,
 greater on the left are noted, not substantially changed in the interval.
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Moderate to severe multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine with bridging anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, with small bilateral
 pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
