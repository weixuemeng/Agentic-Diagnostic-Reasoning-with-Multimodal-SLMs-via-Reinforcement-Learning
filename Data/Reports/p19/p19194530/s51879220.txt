 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13 11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is improved aeration at the left base, although persistent patchy
 opacity with associated layering effusion likely reflects residual atelectasis
 or resolving pneumonia.  There is also improved aeration within the right lung
 possibly related to improved inspiration and resolving airspace disease.  The
 right hilum appears somewhat prominent but when correlated with the recent
 chest CT of ___, this likely reflects a combination of small hilar
 lymph nodes and prominent vascular structures.  The heart remains enlarged. 
 No pneumothorax.
