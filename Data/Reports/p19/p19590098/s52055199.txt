 would be advised.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A
 tortuous calcified aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip within the stomach and the side port near the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Advancement should be considered to minimize the risk of
 aspiration.  Results of this examination were conveyed to ___, the patient's
