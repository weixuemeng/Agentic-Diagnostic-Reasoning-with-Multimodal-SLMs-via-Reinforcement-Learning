 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are persistent bibasilar
 opacities, right greater than left, which may reflect ongoing persistent
 pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small though persist.  Vascular
 congestion is new and mild, though there is no overt interstitial edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Dense calcifications of the thoracic aorta are
 unchanged from prior.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may reflect
 persistent pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 3.  New mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no interstial edema.
