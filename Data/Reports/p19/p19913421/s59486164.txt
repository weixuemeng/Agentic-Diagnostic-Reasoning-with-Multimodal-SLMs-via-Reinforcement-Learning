                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Mild peribronchial opacification at the left lung base posteriorly suggests
 bronchiectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no consolidation or any
 focal abnormality to suggest infarction, though the diagnosis of acute
 pulmonary embolus is not generally made with conventional chest radiographs. 
 Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature unremarkable.  No pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
