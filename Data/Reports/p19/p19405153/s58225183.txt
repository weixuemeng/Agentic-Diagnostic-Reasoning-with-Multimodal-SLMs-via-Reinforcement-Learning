                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient status post redo sternotomy, mitral valve repair, evaluate
 for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and associated
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is an apparently new retrosternal lucency, which
 is difficult to assess due to suboptimal positioning on the lateral view.  No
 focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Postoperative
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Retrosternal lucency, possibly related to postoperative gas collection
 versus pre-existing bullae. Repeat lateral CXR with improved positioning may
 be helpful for initial further evaluation.
