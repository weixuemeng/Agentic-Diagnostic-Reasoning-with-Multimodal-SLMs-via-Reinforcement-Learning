                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are median sternotomy wires with mitral valve
 replacement in place.  Heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are stable with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted. 
 There has been interval resolution of the right-sided pleural effusion and
 improvement in the small left pleural effusion. Patchy atelectasis in the left
 lung base persists.  There is no pneumothorax.  Previously seen retrosternal
 lucency has resolved and was likely post-operative gas.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of previously noted right pleural effusion, and
 decreased size of trace left pleural effusion. Mild left basilar atelectasis.
