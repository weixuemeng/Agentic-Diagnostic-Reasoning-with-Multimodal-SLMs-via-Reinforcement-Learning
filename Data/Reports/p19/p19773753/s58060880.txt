 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pressure, obesity, anxiety.  Please
 evaluate for evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  The right lung is clear while the
 left lung demonstrates a retrocardiac opacity that is confirmed in the lateral

 evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
