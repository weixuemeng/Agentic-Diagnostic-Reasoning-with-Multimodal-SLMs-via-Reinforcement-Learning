                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with generalized weakness  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may
 be due to atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection however is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
