                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status with new osseous requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from outside institution.  No prior studies
 available here at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  The patient's chin overlies the right
 lung apex, making its evaluation suboptimal.  There are low lung volumes,
 which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Evidence of mild interstitial
 edema is seen.  On the lateral view, there is patchy opacity projecting over
 posterior lung base, possibly on the right, consolidation at that location due
 to infection or aspiration not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  Prominence of the hila may relate to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes and evidence of interstitial edema.  Focal patchy opacity
 projecting over posterior lung base, possibly on the right, may represent
 underlying consolidation possibly due to infection or aspiration, atelectasis,
 or artifact.
