                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent PICC insertion and NSVT  // c/f picc
 tip placement      c/f picc tip placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a right subclavian PICC line.  The tip is not optimally seen, though appears
 to be in the mid to lower SVC.
 The area of increased opacification in the left mid zone has increased in
 size.  In the appropriate clinical setting, developing pneumonia would have to
 be seriously considered.
