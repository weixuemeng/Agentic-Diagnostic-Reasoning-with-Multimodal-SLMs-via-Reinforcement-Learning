                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left rib pain status post fall.  Evaluate for left rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest and left rib radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  No displaced left rib fracture is seen, but the ribs are not
 adequately penetrated on chest radiography.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  If clinically warranted,
 dedicated left rib radiographs could be pursued for better assessment of the
 left ribs.
