                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a rounded opacity in the left lower lobe, with possible
 cavitation.  Minimal ill-defined nodular opacities are also noted in the right
 upper and mid lung fields, suggestive of additional sites of infection.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia, with predominant abnormality in the left
 lower lobe, where there is a rounded opacity with a suggestion of cavitation.
 A CT of chest should be consider for further assessment.
