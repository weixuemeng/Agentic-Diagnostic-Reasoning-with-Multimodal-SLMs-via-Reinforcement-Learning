                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Ataxia and sudden headache.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. The chest is hyperinflated. Slight blunting along the left
 costophrenic angle suggests a trace effusion or perhaps minor scarring. There
 is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right. The lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
