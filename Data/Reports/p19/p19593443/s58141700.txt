                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypertension  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles
 may be due to trace pleural effusions and/or mild atelectasis. No pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  There is
 prominence of the hila without vascular congestion and underlying
 lymphadenopathy could be present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles may be due to trace pleural effusions
 and/or mild atelectasis.
 
 Prominence of the hila without vascular congestion could be due to prominent
 pulmonary vessels however underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  This
 could be further evaluated for on nonurgent chest CT.
