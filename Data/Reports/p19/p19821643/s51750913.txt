                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with wheezing  // infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is mild
 hyperinflation, consistent with emphysema. Heterogeneous opacities in the lung
 apices are consistent with apical scarring. Similar smaller opacities are seen
 in the right upper and bilateral lower lobes. No lobar consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent apical scarring and emphysema.  No focal consolidation. In light of
 the abdominal findings, a chest CT is recommended for staging purposes.
