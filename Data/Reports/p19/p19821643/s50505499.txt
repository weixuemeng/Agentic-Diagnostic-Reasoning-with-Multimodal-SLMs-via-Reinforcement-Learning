                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of cancer presenting with
 bilateral lower extremity edema and abdominal pain, found avenue pancreatic
 mass.  Evaluate for mass/mets, cardiomegaly, pulm edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right subclavian approach Port-A-Cath tip is new and its tip projects over
 the expected region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein just at its
 confluence with the SVC.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and hyperlucent,
 consistent with emphysema.  No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal
 consolidation.  The heart is mildly enlarged, increased from the prior exam. 
 There is pulmonary vascular congestion but no over pulmonary edema.  Prominent
 reticular scarring at the bilateral apices is probably similar to the prior
 exam and better characterized on the prior chest CT.  No obvious pulmonary
 mass.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right Port-A-Cath tip ends in the left brachiocephalic vein just prior to
 the SVC confluence.
 
 2.  No obvious pulmonary mass.  Given the patient's history, dedicated Chest
 CT would be recommended evaluate for metastatic lesions.
 
 3.  Persistent prominently biapical calcified micronodular pattern, better
 characterized on the prior chest CT from ___.
 
 4.  Emphysema.
 
 5.  Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt edema.
