                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man intubated.  Evaluate for aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparison is available.  The patient's true identity
 is not known at the time of interpretation.
 
 FINDINGS:  A semi-upright frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 The carina is not well seen, but the endotracheal tube is directed towards the
 right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube follows the expected course,
 although the tip is below the inferior level of the image.  Low lung volumes
 result in bronchovascular crowding.  Right linear atelectasis is seen.  Mild
 opacity in the right upper lobe may represent atelectasis or early infection. 
 Heart size is within normal limits. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. The carina is not well visualized, but the endotracheal tube is directed
 towards the main stem bronchus and could be be retracted to avoid right
 bronchial intubation.
 2. Mild right upper lung opacity may represent atelectasis or early infection.
 Follow up is recommended.
 
 Finding #1 is discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:45 a.m. ___ upon
 discovery.
