                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of right buttock abscess
 per radiology technologist, reasons for chest x-ray are fever and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Dual-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the
 expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  There is mild left base
 atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely relates to
 overlying soft tissue, although lateral view would be helpful for
 confirmation.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left base atelectasis.  Relative mild blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may be related to overlying soft tissue, though lateral
 would be helpful to assess for possible small pleural effusion.
