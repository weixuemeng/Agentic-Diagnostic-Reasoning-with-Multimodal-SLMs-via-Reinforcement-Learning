                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with stable left pneumothorax, in need of interval
 change assessment.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no longer an apical component to the previously described
 left pneumothorax.  A small-to-moderate left pleural effusion persists on the
 left with few areas of streaky associated atelectasis.  An air-fluid level
 best seen on the lateral view indicated some degree of hydropneumothorax. 
 There is no evidence of diaphragmatic flattening or mediastinal shift.  Right
 mid rib fractures are nondisplaced, not well appreciated on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of apical portion of left pneumothorax with lower left
 hydropneumothorax; no evidence of tension.
