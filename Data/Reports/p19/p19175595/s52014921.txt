                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left flank and rib pain after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is minimal streaky opacity within the
 left lower lobe, likely reflective of atelectasis.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the lateral view posteriorly suggests a small left
 pleural effusion.  No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 definitively seen.  There are mildly displaced fractures of the left lateral
 ___ and likely 9th ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly displaced fractures of the left ___ and likely ___ lateral ribs.  Mild
 left lower lobe atelectasis and probable trace left pleural effusion.
