                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax in the setting of rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to earlier study of this date, there are lower lung
 volumes with little change in the degree of small-to-moderate left
 pneumothorax.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with
 atelectasis.  Right lung is clear and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion.
