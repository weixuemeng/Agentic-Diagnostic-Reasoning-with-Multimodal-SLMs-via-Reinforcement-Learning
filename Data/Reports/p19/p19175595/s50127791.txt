                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 degree of left pneumothorax.  Persistent atelectatic changes are seen at the
 left base.  On the lateral view, there is an air-fluid level posteriorly,
 consistent with some degree of hydropneumothorax, possibly loculated.
 
 Dilatation of gas-filled loops of bowel is consistent with adynamic ileus.
