                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new biventricular ICD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Biventricular ICD noted over the left chest with leads properly
 projecting over the right ventricle, right atrium, and left ventricle. 
 Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are unchanged.  The heart is top normal in
 size.  Opacification of the right lung seen previously, likely representing
 layering of pleural effusion is no longer seen in this upright radiograph. 
 There is a small right-sided effusion seen better on the lateral radiograph. 
 There is a new area of opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle, possibly
 representing an area of fluid or segmental atelectasis in the lower lobe.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pleural effusion.
 2.  Focal opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle likely represents an area
 of fluid or atelectasis in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe. 
 Suggest followup chest x-ray to better evaluate this region.
