                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of smoking.  New cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left axillary pacemaker is present with the wires in standard
 position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Sternal wires are intact. 
 Slight rightward deviation of the trachea is stable due to known thyroid
 nodule.  New bibasilar hazy opacification, greater on the left than on the
 right, most likely represents new mild pulmonary edema, although an underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 new.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable mild pulmonary edema, although underlying pneumonia, specifically
 at the left base, cannot be excluded.
 2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
