                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia and shortness of breath  // eval for
 CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided pacer device is
 stable in position.  New since the prior study is moderate to severe pulmonary
 edema.  There is also a new right mid to lower lung opacity suggesting large
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not
 excluded.  Right perihilar mass with associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy
 was better assessed on prior CT/PET CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  Right perihilar mass and mediastinal adenopathy
 better assessed on prior CT.  Left perihilar opacity could relate to pulmonary
 edema versus underlying disease spread or infection.
