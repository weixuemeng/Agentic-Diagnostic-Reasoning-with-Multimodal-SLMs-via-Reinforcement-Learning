 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 06:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stably enlarged with particular
 prominence of the right hilum which could be all vascular although
 lymphadenopathy should also be considered.  The pulmonary edema has resolved,
 although there is mild cephalization of the vasculature consistent with
 pulmonary venous hypertension.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity could reflect
 atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  No pneumothorax.
