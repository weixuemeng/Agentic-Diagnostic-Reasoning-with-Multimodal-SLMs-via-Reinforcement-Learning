                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Tooth extraction from right lower lobe, check for foreign body and
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously described radiopaque foreign body is no longer
 visualized; however, there has been an increased amount of opacity in the
 right lower lobe consistent with volume loss/infiltrate.  There is minimal
 pulmonary vascular re-distribution.  Clips in the left upper quadrant are
 again seen.  There is a small left pleural effusion.
