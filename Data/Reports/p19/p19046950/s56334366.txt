 Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and mediastinal venous engorgement have worsened
 consistent with biventricular cardiac decompensation, to the point of
 borderline pulmonary edema.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  A new right suprahilar opacity is probably worsening
 segmental atelectasis.
 
 With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet, 6.5 cm
 above the carina should be advanced 2 cm for more secure positioning. 
 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right PIC line ends
 close to just beyond the superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
