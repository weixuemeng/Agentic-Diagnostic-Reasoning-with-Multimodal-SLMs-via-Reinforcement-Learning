 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:25 PM
  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates flattening of the diaphragms
  consistent with emphysematous changes.  No focal consolidation convincing for
  pneumonia is present.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
  evidence of pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities bilaterally at the bases may
  reflect scarring or alternatively atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or large
  pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo male with complicated history including RNY bypass presents
 with partial SBO  // Desaturation with ambulation, COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are within normal limits however there is mild flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms within increased AP diameter of the thorax which may reflect
 COPD.  No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.  The heart is
 not enlarged.  Scarring versus atelectasis of the bilateral lung bases.  Focal
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm unchanged compared to the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.  Findings suggestive of COPD.
