                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of cardiac silhouette
 which is likely within normal limits.  The aorta is mildly unfolded. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
