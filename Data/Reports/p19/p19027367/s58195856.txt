                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fall with chest wall pain.  Please evaluate for rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral exams of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  There is stable
 mild tortuosity of the aorta.  There is unchanged lung hyperinflation with
 blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally consistent with a small
 pleural effusions, left greater than right.  This is overall improved compared
 to the prior exam.  There is an increased area of opacification in the
 retrocardiac region which could be secondary to atelectasis; however, an acute
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  New fractures are seen along the
 lateral right fourth, fifth, sixth ribs, overall minimally displaced.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Acute fractures are seen along the lateral right fourth, fifth, sixth
 ribs, minimally displaced.
 2.  Increase in opacification in the retrocardiac region could be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 4.  Diffusely osteopenic bones.
