                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of tachypnea, hypoxia,
 question pneumothorax, initial chest x-ray earlier today.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:47.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 questionable finding of pneumothorax on the prior study is no longer
 appreciated and was likely due to artifact/possible skin fold.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen on the current study.  Bilateral mid to lower lung
 opacities are again seen without significant interval change.  There are
 possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumothorax on the current study;
 finding on the prior study was likely artifactual.  Persistent bilateral
 pulmonary opacities and possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
