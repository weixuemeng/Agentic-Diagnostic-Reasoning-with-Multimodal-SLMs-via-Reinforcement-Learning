                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar to multiple prior examinations, there is a superimposed
 accentuation of the prominent interstitial markings, presumably due to
 underlying interstitial lung disease.  There is relative sparing of both lung
 apices, right more prominent than the left; however, this may be partially due
 to underlying emphysematous blebs.  The patient's chin overlies portions of
 the apices.  There is calcified atheromatous plaque at the arch.  A large
 calcified lymph node is noted in the aorticopulmonary window.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, but stable.  There is a right pleural effusion, which
 results presumably in the blunting of the right costophrenic angle and fluid
 tracking within the right minor fissure.  No left effusion is noted.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities predominantly in the right lower lung and in the
 left mid and lower lung zones.  The pattern mimics that seen on prior
 radiographs with slightly more confluent opacity on the current study.  This
 may be due to asymmetric distribution of edema due to underlying emphysema or
 possibly multifocal pneumonia.  Correlate clinically.  Consider diuresis and
 short interval followup radiographs to help discriminate the two.
