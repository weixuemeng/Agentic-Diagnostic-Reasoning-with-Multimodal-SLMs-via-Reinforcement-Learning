                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recurrent aspiration pneumonia. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 There are persistent airspace opacities more confluent within the lung bases
 and the left upper lobe.  These are stable.  This again most likely represents
 multifocal pneumonia potentially due to aspiration.  The heart size is
 enlarged but stable.  There are no pneumothoraces.  Degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine are seen.
