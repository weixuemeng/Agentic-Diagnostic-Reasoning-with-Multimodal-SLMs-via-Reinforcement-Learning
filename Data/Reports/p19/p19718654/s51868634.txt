                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Delirium.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently yesterday
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  As with most recent radiograph, the patient is significantly
 rotated, limiting evaluation.  Increase in bibasilar opacities, although
 probably partially explained by low lung volumes and atelectasis, are
 suspicious for superimposed infection.  As previously noted, the aorta is
 tortuous and the pulmonary artery is enlarged, suggesting pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  There is no apical pneumothorax and no pleural effusions are
 seen on this single frontal radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities, although partly
 explained by atelectasis, are suspicious for infection.
