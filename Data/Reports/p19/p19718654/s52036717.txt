                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Difficulty breathing.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There has been interval resolution of right lower lobe collapse.  Still
 probably there is right middle lobe collapse.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax or large effusion.  Widened mediastinum is still.  Cardiomegaly
 cannot be assessed.  Left lower lobe opacities have improved, likely
 atelectasis.  The upper lungs are clear.
