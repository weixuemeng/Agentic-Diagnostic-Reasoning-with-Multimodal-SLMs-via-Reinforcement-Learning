                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes most pronounced in the
 lung apices.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with
 the heart size appearing mildly enlarged.  Enlargement of pulmonary arteries
 is re- demonstrated, compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities have progressed compared to the previous radiograph.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Posterior thoracic fusion hardware is
 re- demonstrated along with multiple surgical ___ along the midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect worsening atelectasis or
 infection, with aspiration not excluded.  Emphysema.  Enlargement of pulmonary
 arteries compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
