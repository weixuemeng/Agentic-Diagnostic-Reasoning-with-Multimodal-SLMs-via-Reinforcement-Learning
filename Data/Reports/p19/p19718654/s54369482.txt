                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:32 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new central venous line.  Evaluate placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 In the interim, patient has had spinal stabilization.  New intended left
 internal jugular line passes behind the left clavicle and surgical device, out
 of view. Tip probably does not enter the transverse portion of the left
 brachiocephalic vein.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement ending at the thoracic inlet.
 
 Lung volumes are very low, but left lung appears clear aside from mild basilar
 atelectasis.  On the right, atelectasis is much more severe and there is
 probably lower lobe collapse, perhaps middle lobe collapse as well, and if
 they are accompanied by small right pleural effusion that would be
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is indeterminate but not
 substantially enlarged.
