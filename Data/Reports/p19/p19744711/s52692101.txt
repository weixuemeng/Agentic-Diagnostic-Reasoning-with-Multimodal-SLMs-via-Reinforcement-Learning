                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is likely related to low lung volumes.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar streaky opacities, likely atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Infection is not completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
