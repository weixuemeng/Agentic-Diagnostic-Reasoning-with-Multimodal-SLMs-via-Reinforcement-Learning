                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old male with shortness of breath on exertion and a
 history of CABG.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The right lung is clear. Linear
 opacity across the left lower lung field likely represents scarring vs
 atelectasis.  There is moderate cardiomegaly and equivocal bulky hila, but the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from prior. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires are noted in the midline
 and there are no other fractures.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
