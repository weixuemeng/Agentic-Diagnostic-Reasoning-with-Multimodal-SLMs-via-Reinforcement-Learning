                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of NG tube placement.  Please evaluate NG tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube is seen extending below the diaphragm positioned
 appropriately within the stomach.  The stomach demonstrates significant
 distention, consistent with patient's known small bowel obstruction. 
 Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base and more confluent left basilar
 opacification is likely secondary to atelectasis, and overall similar to the
 prior exam.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable compared to exams dated
 back to at least ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip located within
 the body of the stomach. Distention of the stomach and visualized small bowel
 loops is consistent with patient's known small bowel obstruction as seen on
 the CT of the abdomen performed on ___ at 7:30 p.m.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, while due in part to elevated diaphragm, could also
 be due to aspiration.
