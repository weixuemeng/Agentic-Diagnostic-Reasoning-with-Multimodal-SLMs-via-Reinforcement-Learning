 contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs
 are well expanded. Diffuse haziness projecting over the entire left lung is
 noted, which may be due in part to overlying support devices.  Gaseous
 distension of the stomach is noted. The visualized osseous structures are
 within normal limits.
