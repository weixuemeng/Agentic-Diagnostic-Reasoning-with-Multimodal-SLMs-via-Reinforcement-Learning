                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 There is a mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature which may be
 due to pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible minimal interstitial edema
 which may be accentuated by low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable since the prior study.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are noted at the shoulder
 joints but not optimally evaluated.
