                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:23
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question SBO, assess for NG tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 23:47.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:23 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 seen but likely within the stomach.  A right internal jugular dual-lumen
 catheter is unchanged in position with its tip at the distal SVC.  Lung
 volumes remain low with streaky linear opacities at both bases likely
 reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema although
 there is crowding of the vasculature and possible pulmonary venous
 hypertension.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is stable and may
 reflect pleural thickening or a small effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged although the heart is somewhat
 globular in appearance which may represent cardiomegaly although a pericardial
 effusion should also be considered.  A right shoulder arthroplasty is seen
 unchanged in appearance.
