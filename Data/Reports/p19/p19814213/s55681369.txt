                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mild to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinal contour is due to low lung volumes, an aortic knob
 remains distinct.  Is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result
 of low lung volumes without with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacities are noted in the lung bases which likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar patchy
 opacities, likely atelectasis.
