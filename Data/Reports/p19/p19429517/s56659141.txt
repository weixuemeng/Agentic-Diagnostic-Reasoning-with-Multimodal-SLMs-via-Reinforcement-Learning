                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of CHF p/w cough, dyspnea, and weight gain  // assess
 for edema, effusion, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. More
 focal consolidation identified at the right lung base. Moderate to severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen. There is no prior exam to
 evaluate for interval change. No acute osseous abnormalities, hypertrophic
 changes noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. More focal region of
 opacity at the right lung base could represent superimposed infection.
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette likely due to cardiomegaly noting that pericardial
 effusion would also be possible.
