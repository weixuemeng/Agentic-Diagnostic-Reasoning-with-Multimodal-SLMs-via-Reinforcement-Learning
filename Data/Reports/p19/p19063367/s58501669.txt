                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with need for central line HD  // r/o TB, preop
 eval
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes and underpenetration due to overlying soft
 tissues.  Allowing for this, there is moderate to moderately severe
 cardiomegaly, straightening of left heart border trauma and effacement of the
 AP window.  Mild prominence the right hilum is noted, but is likely
 accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution.  There may be mild vascular plethora, but
 this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes and underpenetration. 
 No gross s right-sided effusion.  The left costophrenic sulcus is clear. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis
 
 No calcified lymph nodes, apical scarring, hilar retraction and/or obvious
 calcified granuloma identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited evaluation due to low inspiratory volumes, underpenetration and
 absence of lateral view.
 
 Moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly.
 
 Mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 No definite infiltrate.  No gross effusion.
 
 If there is clinical concern for detailed evaluation of the mediastinum and
 hila, then cross-sectional imaging would help for further assessment.
