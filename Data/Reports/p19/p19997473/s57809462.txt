 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16:27

 The Impella support device now has its tip projecting over the more proximal
 aspect of the right ventricle being retracted approximately 6 cm since the
 previous study.  The femoral Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in position. 
 Interval appearance of streaky opacities at the right base likely reflectsing
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
