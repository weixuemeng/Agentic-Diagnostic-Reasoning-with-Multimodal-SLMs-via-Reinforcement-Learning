                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post fall with left lateral rib pain
 and T- and L-spine tenderness to palpation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest with dedicated views of the
 rib ribs were obtained for a total of 7 images. Lung volumes are slightly low,
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for
 lung volumes.  No free air is seen under the diaphragm. 
 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen. There is mild loss of thoracic vertebral
 body height in the mid thoracic spine of unknown chronicity. Acromioclavicular
 joint arthropathy is seen with calcification adjacent to the humeral head,
 which may represent calcific tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation.
 2.  No displaced rib fracture.
 3.  Loss of vertebral height in the mid thoracic spine may be degenerative,
 but exact chronicity is unknown.  Correlate with site of patient's pain.
