                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac stents appear unchanged.  The heart is at the upper limits
 of normal size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  Background coarsening of lung
 markings at the each lung apex suggests minor unchanged subpleural scarring. 
 Patchy opacity in the right costophrenic angle suggests minor unchanged
 scarring.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute disease.
