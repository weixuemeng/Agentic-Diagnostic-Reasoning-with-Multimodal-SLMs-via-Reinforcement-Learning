                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is faint retrocardiac
 opacity which could potentially be due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Tortuous descending
 thoracic aorta is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis given lower lung
 volumes, noting that infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Otherwise,
 unremarkable chest x-ray.
