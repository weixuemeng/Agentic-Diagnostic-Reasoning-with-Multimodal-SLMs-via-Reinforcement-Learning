                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with right lateral and posterior chest wall
 tenderness.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen.
 
 Incidentally noted are several tiny calcified granulomas, stable from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture identified.  However, the chest
 radiograph is not sensitive for the detection of small non-displaced rib
 fractures.  If there is further clinical concern, a dedicated rib series with
 a skin marker indicating the location of tenderness is recommended.
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
