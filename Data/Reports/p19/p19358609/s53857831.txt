                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest was provided.  There is again
 noted to be post-surgical change of the left lung apex with volume loss and
 leftward retraction of the mediastinal structures.  There is also evidence of
 prior left upper rib cage resection with chest wall deformity evident.  The
 right lung is hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency, likely reflecting
 underlying emphysema.  Coarsened interstitial markings with micronodular
 opacity in the right lower lung likely reflect scarring and appears stable
 from prior exam.  The left CP angle is excluded thus limiting evaluation.  No
 definite new consolidation in the left lung to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  The heart size appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes in the left upper chest, with no definite
 signs of pneumonia.
