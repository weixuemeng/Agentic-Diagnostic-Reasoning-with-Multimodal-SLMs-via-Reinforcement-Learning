                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA with increasing O2 requirement and right
 chest pain  // eval for effusion, PTX      eval for effusion, PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increased
 opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This
 is consistent with developing pneumonia, possibly associated with some volume
 loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Increased opacification at
 the right base could reflect either atelectatic changes or a multifocal
 infiltrate.
