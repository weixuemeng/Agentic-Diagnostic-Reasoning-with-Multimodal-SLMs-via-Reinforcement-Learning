                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT, pulm edema, PNA  // interval change.
 line and tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's neck is flexed to the right.  The ET tube tip appears to be 0.6
 cm above the carina.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Side port of the NG
 tube is likely below the GE junction, with the tip out of view.  There is
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Moderate right and small to moderate left effusions
 appear similar to prior, allowing for differences in patient positioning. 
 Retrocardiac opacity and silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm are similar to
 prior.  Left upper lung distortion is similar to prior. There is no
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Aortic
 calcification projecting over the heart is similar to prior.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Evaluation of ET tube location is suboptimal due to patient positioning,
 but appears low.
 2. Right PICC and NG tube are similar to prior.
 3. Moderate right and small to moderate left effusions appear similar to
 prior, allowing for differences in patient positioning.
 4. Other findings are similar to ___.
