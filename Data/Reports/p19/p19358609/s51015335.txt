                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, COPD, aspiration question new consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___ and chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a consolidation in the
 left lower lobe which is slightly increased compared to the recent CT.
 Parenchymal opacification in the right lower lobe likely reflects aspiration. 
 Diffusely abnormal background parenchymal changes are again seen.  The
 bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size.  There is an unchanged
 rounded structure in the right costophrenic sinus which was masked by the
 pleural effusion on the prior CT exam.  There is stable deformity of the left
 thoracic cage.  No pneumothorax.
