                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AFib with right ventricular regurgitation.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or other infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs demonstrate stable extensive
 post-surgical changes of the left hemithorax with associated loss of volume.
 Stable scarring noted in the right lung apex.  On a background of chronic lung
 disease and chronic bibasilar opacifications there is new prominence of the
 interstitium as well as Kerley B lines consistent with pulmonary edeam.  Heart
 size is top normal and stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable background chronic lung changes.  Stable top normal heart
 size with evidence of volume overload consistent with provided diagnosis of
 right ventricular regurgitation.
