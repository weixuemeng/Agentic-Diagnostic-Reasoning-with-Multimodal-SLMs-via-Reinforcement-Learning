                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lung and bladder cancer, now here with signs
 of pneumonia and oxygen desaturations.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The heart size is at upper limits of normal, but stable
 compared to prior study as are the mediastinal contours.  The lungs continue
 to demonstrate bibasilar opacities, becoming slightly more confluent on the
 left - a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is also present in the setting of severe emphysema.  Biapical
 scarring is unchanged.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
