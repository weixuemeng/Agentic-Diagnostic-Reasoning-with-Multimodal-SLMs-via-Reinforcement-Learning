                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and hypoxia and intravenous antibiotics.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Superimposed on chronic volume loss, parenchymal scarring, and pleural
 thickening in the left hemithorax, there is a persistent superimposed
 opacification in the left lung, which has worsened somewhat between over two
 days including increased volume loss. Findings in the right lung appear more
 chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening volume loss and opacification of the left lung suggesting pneumonia
 superimposed on chronic findings.
