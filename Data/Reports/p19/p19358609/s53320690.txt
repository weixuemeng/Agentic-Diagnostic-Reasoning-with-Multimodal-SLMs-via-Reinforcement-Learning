                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of lung cancer status post left
 upper lobectomy and recent multifocal pneumonia.  Evaluate for resolution of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.  CT chest
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The multifocal bilateral opacities have essentially completely resolved since
 ___.  Left pleural effusion has also completely resolved.  Residual
 background emphysematous changes most prominent in the right upper lung with
 scarring and pleural thickening as well as background post-left upper
 lobectomy changes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are unchanged
 compared to ___.   Blunting of the left costophrenic angle reflects
 thickening/scarring.  A calcified perihilar node is unchanged.  The heart is
 normal in size.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous,
 unchanged.  Dextroconvex scoliosis of thoracic spine is overall similar with
 similar distortion of thoracic cage.  Prominent degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine are also overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
