                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:48 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left-sided chest pain after diaphragm repair
 for stab wound, question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 8:32 a.m.
 
 Lower lung volumes may account for greater opacification in the right lower
 lung compared to 8:30 a.m.  Left lower lobe remains airless, presumably
 consolidated, but raising concern for airway occlusion by retained secretions.
 There is at least a moderate left pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax.
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is comparable to the
 preoperative appearance.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the upper right atrium, and would need to be
 withdrawn 2 cm to be located with confidence in the low SVC.
