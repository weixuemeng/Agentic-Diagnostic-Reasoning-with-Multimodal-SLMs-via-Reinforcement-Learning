                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Sensory changes.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small hiatal hernia is demonstrated on the
 lateral view.  Minimal tortuosity of the aorta cannot be excluded.
