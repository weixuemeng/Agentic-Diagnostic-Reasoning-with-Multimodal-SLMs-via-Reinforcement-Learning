 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post esophagogastrectomy procedure. 
 Nasogastric tube remains in place within the neoesophagus, and post-operative
 alterations of the right mediastinal contour appear similar.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion appears slightly more prominent, but positional differences
 between the studies limit comparison.  Right basilar atelectasis is unchanged,
 but linear left basilar atelectasis has slightly worsened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative alterations of right mediastinal contour
 following esophagogastrectomy procedure.  Questionable increase in right
 pleural effusion.
