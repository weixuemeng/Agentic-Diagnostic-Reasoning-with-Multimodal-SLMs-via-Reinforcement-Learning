                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with esophageal carcinoma and malignant right
 pleural effusion admitted for dyspnea.  Still short of breath after diuresis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Upper and mid esophageal stent is unchanged in position.  Left infusion port
 ends in the SVC.  Right pleural thickening and small right pleural effusion
 have worsened.  Widely disseminated micronodulation and septal thickening,
 seen best on CTA from ___, could be due to simple congestive heart
 failure, but the presence of pulmonary nodules suggests this is instead
 disseminated malignancy.
