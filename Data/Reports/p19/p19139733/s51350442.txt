                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophagogastrectomy, to assess for pneumothorax and tube positions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal
 tube in place with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The
 esophageal tube lies above the diaphragm.  Right chest tube is in place
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  Left central catheter again extends to
 lower portion of the SVC.
 
 There are lower lung volumes which may account for the apparent prominence of
 the transverse diameter of the heart and fullness of the pulmonary vessels,
 though some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure should be considered. 
 Blunting of the left and possibly right costophrenic angles could reflect some
 pleural fluid with underlying compressive atelectasis.
