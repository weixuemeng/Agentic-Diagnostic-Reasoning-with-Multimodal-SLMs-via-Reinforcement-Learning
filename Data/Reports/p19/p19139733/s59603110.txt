                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post esophagogastrectomy, please assess NG
 tube position, edema, effusion, or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Findings:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube is no longer visualized.  Port-A-Cath tip and right IJ line terminate in
 the lower SVC and are unchanged.  Right apical chest tube is unchanged.  The
 NG tube is located above the diaphragm; it loops around in mid mediastinum;
 the tip points superiorly and projects over the anterior second rib; position
 is unchanged. Widening of the mediastinum appears more marked but this
 difference may be projectional given patient rotation; this likely represents
 post-surgical changes.  Cardiac silhouette is stable.  Low volume lungs are
 clear except for increased atelectasis in the right base.  No significant
 pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  NGT in unchanged position; interval removal of ETT; other lines unchanged.
 2.  Increased atelectasis in the right lower base. 
 3.  Apparent increase in mediastinal widening may be projectional and can be
 reassessed at next chest radiograph.
