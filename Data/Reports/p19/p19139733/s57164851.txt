                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ AT 9:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 19:42.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 9:56 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There is persistent right pleural
 effusion with some associated patchy opacity which could reflect compressive
 atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Left lung remains
 clear.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
