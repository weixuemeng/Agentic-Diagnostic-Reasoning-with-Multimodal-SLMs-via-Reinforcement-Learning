                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent esophageal stent placement.  New atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, a new esophageal stent is in place.  There is
 diffuse interstitial prominence, most likely consistent with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Additionally, there is opacification at the right base, more
 predominant than elsewhere in the lung parenchyma, which is concerning for
 aspiration or pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The cardiac size is normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Opacification of the right base is concerning for aspiration. 
 Alternatively, in the appropriate clinical setting, could be pneumonia.
