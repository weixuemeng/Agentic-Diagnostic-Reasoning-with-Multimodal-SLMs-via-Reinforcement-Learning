                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post MIE, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  The
 position of right apical chest tube, Port-A-Cath, and NG tube is unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There is increased opacification of
 the left base suggesting increased pleural effusion and surrounding
 atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right base likely represents
 increased pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, superimposed
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
