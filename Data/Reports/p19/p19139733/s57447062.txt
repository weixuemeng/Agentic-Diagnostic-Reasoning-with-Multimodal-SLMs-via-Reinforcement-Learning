                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation for fluid accumulation, infection
 or other pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild improvement
 with increase in transparency of the left lung base and the right lung base,
 potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
 
 The right pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent.  However,
 opacities are still clearly visible at both lung bases and in the right upper
 lobe.  The position of the esophageal stent and the left Port-A-Cath are
 constant.
