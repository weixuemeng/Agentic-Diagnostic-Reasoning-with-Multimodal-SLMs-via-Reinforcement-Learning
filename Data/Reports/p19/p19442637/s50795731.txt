                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness, fatigue, lethargy, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral view of the chest is suboptimal due to overlying
 external artifact.  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral view of the chest is suboptimal due to overlying external
 artifact.  Otherwise, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
