                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple comorbidities (including ESRD on
 HD, uncharacterized renal cyst/masses, DM2), here for anemia/hymolysis,
 developed cough.  // Please evaluate for evidence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left-sided dialysis catheter extending to the region of the
 cavoatrial junction. Allowing for differences in positioning, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is background
 hyperinflation. On the current exam, the upper zone vessels appear slightly
 prominent bilaterally. There is new atelectasis at the left lung base and
 minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. No frank consolidation or gross
 effusion is identified. Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle is likely
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild prominence of the upper zone vessels, without overt CHF. Minimal
 atelectasis at the left base. No definite focal infiltrate and no frank
 consolidation identified.
