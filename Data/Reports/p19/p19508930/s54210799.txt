                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post resection via VATS of intrathoracic parathyroid
 adenoma and chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier.
 
 There is a questionable left apical pneumothorax; followup is recommended. 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is normal.  Left lower lobe
 opacities have minimally improved consistent with improving atelectasis, but
 aspiration could be also present.  In the right upper lobe, the ill-defined
 opacities could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration.  The stomach is very
 distended.
