                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left VATS, for interval check.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax or consolidation. 
 Relative opacification seen posteriorly on the lateral view could represent
 post-surgical change, since there is no evidence of consolidation on the
 frontal view.
