 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple seizure d/o who Increase in seizure 
 // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left vagal nerve stimulator is in unchanged position.  Low lung volumes
 accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours and result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, there is likely
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax, fracture or dislocation.  Limited
 assessment of the abdomen is unremarkable.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is
 likely due to adjacent gastric distension.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  If clinical suspicion persists, repeat radiograph
 with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete assessment.
