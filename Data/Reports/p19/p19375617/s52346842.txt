                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p lumbar lami on ___ with concern for TMC 
 // comparison XR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New bibasilar densities are noted. A linear density at the left base is likely
 related to low lung volumes and atelectasis, however the density at the right
 base is less well-defined and more concerning for pneumonia in the proper
 clinical setting. There is persistent moderate distention of the colon at the
 splenic flexure, which is essentially unchanged dating back to ___ and may be
 chronic.  More severely and acutely dilated loops are better evaluated on the
 recent abdominal radiographs of ___.There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right base opacity may be due to atelectasis, however in the proper
 clinical setting pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Colonic distention is better evaluated on a recent abdominal radiographs.
