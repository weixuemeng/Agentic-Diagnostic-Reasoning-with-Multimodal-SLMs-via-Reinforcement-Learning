                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, assess for interstitial lung disease, mass, or
 any subtle evidence of endobronchial lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs demonstrate
 stable hyperinflation without paucity of the upper lung zones to suggest COPD.
 Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable hyperinflation of lungs.  No focal opacifications.   
 Please note chest radiographs are not sensitive for subtle interstitial lung
 disease or endobronchial lesions.  If continued clinical concern, recommend
 evaluation with HRCT.
