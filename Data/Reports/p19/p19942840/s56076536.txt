                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is minimal prominence at the AP
 window which may be artifactual; however, underlying lymph node not excluded. 
 This could be further assessed on a non-urgent chest CT.  No displaced
 fracture seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Slight prominence
 of the AP window may be artifactual; however, underlying lymph nodes not
 excluded.  Findings could be further assessed on a non-urgent chest CT.
