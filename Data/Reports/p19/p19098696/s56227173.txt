                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure activity, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Fusion hardware is noted in the lower cervical spine.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour appears somewhat prominent, though
 borders appear sharp.  No large effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Retrocardiac
 space is poorly assessed.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with cardiomegaly and mediastinal prominence, which
 in part could reflect technique.  Recommend repeat with dedicated PA and
 laterals with improved/optimized inspiratory effort.
