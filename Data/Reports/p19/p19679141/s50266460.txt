 attempted hiatal hernia repair/Nissen fundoplication today.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear aside from minimal dependent atelectasis.

 within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Note is made of a
 large hiatal hernia, as before.
 
 There is air under both hemidiaphragms, consistent with pneumoperitoneum, not
 unexpected in a post-operative patient.  Additionally, a small quantity of air
 seen within the mediastinum, also not unexpected post-operatively.

 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum are not necessarily unexpected
 findings in a patient status post recent hiatal hernia repair.
