 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  AFib with RVR, dyspnea, troponin leak from outside hospital. 
 Assess for pulmonary edema or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates well expanded lungs.  Lateral
 to the left heart border is a heterogeneous patch which is more likely to
 represent residual of pneumonia rather than asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No
 evidence of active infection.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette noted.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild enlargement of cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 2.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion
 3.  Heterogeneous opacity lateral to the left heart border is more likely to
 represent residual of prior pneumonia than active infection.
