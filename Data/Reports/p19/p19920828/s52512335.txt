 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular line terminates in the cavoatrial junction, adjusted.
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  There is interval
 development of interstitial pulmonary edema.  A right basal opacity most
 likely represents vascular congestion but atelectasis or aspiration is a
 possibility.  Close followup on the subsequent study is recommended.  No
 pneumothorax.
