                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion s/p pigtail  // ___ year
 old woman with pleural effusion s/p pigtail
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The and lateral chest x-ray from ___ at 09:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the degree of opacification in left mid and lower
 zones has progressed, with new obscuration left hemidiaphragm. The appearance
 is suggestive of a left pleural effusion, probably loculated, with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for obscuration of the left heart
 border, prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable and the
 mediastinum remains midline. Possible minimal prominence of the right
 pulmonary artery is unchanged. There is mild upper zone redistribution,
 without other evidence of CHF.
 
 The right lung is grossly clear, except were minimal atelectasis or scarring
 at the right lung base. No gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacification of the left mid and lower zones, likely a combination
 of pleural fluid can collapse and/or consolidation.
