                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion status post pigtail placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ with targeted review of a chest CT also
 from ___.
 
 Compared to prior study, a pigtail catheter has been placed at the base of the
 left lung.  There has been marked interval improvement in degree of
 opacification of the left lung, presumably reflecting marked decrease in the
 size of the left-sided pneumothorax.  Some residual patchy opacity at the left
 lung base is noted, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  There is
 minimal patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region, similar, possibly
 minimally worse compared with one day earlier.  No right-sided effusion.  No
 CHF is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of left lung base pigtail catheter, with marked
 improvement/resolution of left pleural effusion.  
 
 2.  Bibasilar patchy opacities.
 
 3.  No CHF.
 
 4.  No pneumothorax detected.
