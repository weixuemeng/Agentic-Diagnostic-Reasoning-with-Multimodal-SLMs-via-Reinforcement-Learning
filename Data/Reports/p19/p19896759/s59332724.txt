 INDICATION:  HIV, treated for pneumonia, ongoing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:48 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Normal lung volumes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 parenchymal opacities in the left mid lung as well as in the right upper lobe
 are constant.  At the bases of the right lung, in its medial aspect, areas of
 atelectasis has newly appeared.  The distribution and appearance of the
 changes suggests multifocal pneumonia.  Currently, there is no evidence of
 coexisting pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta, otherwise unremarkable hilar and mediastinal contours.
