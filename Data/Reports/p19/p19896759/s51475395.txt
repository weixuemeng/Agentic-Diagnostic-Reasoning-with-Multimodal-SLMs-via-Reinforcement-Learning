                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with HIV and recent pneumonia, worsening
 dyspnea and chest heaviness, night sweats.  Is there worsening pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and
 remains within normal limits.  No change in the appearance of mediastinum and
 thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The, on previous
 examination identified, scattered multiple parenchymal patchy infiltrates
 mostly located to right upper and lower lung fields as well as mid portion of
 left lung have regressed moderately.  Some faint patchy infiltrates remain,
 however.  As before, there is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 as the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Metallic ring shaped
 pressed ornaments are seen as before and unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent evidence of scattered pneumonic infiltrates in patient
 with history of HIV.  Comparison demonstrates that the infiltrates have
 regressed during the latest five days examination interval.
