 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is moderately-severe cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and
 unfolded.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis. There is an equivocal opacity at the right base
 laterally, improved compared with ___, but not significantly changed
 compared with ___. There is slight blunting of the left and ? right
 costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion. 
 
 Again seen is a hiatal hernia. There is severe bilateral glenohumeral
 osteoarthritis with evidence of chronic rotator cuff tears involving both
 shoulders.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 14:43 p.m., I doubt significant interval change.   No
 definite pneumonic infiltrate.
