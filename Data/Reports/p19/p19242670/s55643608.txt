                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal CA with mets to lungs.  Now question post-obstructive
 pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 6:20 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the overall appearance shows some improvement in
 the degree of opacification in the right lung, with renewed visualization of
 the upper portion of the mid zone.  This could reflect interval decrease in
 the size of the right effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Prominent
 vascular interstitial markings in the visualized portion of lung are again
 seen.  Underlying right lung collapse and/or consolidation is likely present. 
 The mediastinum remains grossly midline.  In the left lung, there is patchy
 opacity at the left lung base, similar to the prior film.  The interstitial
 markings are prominent, but less pronounced than on the right side.  No upper
 zone redistribution suggestive of CHF on the left side.  No left-sided
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the degree of opacification of the right
 lung, though considerable opacification remains present.  Please see report of
 chest CT obtained on ___.
