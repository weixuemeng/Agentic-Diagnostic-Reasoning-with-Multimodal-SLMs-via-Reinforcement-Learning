                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ years old man with post-obstructive pneumonia status post
 bronchial stent.
 
 INDICATION:  Progression, pleural effusion and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subclavian catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged
 since prior examination.  There is increased opacification of the right lung,
 mainly for increased pleural effusion.  The right atelectasis seems overall
 unchanged, the left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion are unchanged.
 Heart size is presumably enlarged partially obscured by right lower lobe
 pathology.  Pulmonary edema is improved, especially on the right lung.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased pleural effusion on the right lung with reduced
 pulmonary edema.
