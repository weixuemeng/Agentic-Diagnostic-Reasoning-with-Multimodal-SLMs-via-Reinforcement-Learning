                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:53 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, now with increased shortness of
 breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___, aeration of the left lower lobe around the large mass has
 deteriorated, presumably atelectasis given the rapid change, but conceivably
 pneumonia.  The right hemithorax combination of lower lobe atelectasis and
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has both improved slightly since
 earlier in the day.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart is large but largely
 obscured by adjacent pathology in the right hemithorax.  Interstitial
 pulmonary edema has worsened since earlier this morning.  Left subclavian
 infusion pump ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
