                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung CA, right mainstem occlusion, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray from 19:42 p.m.
 
 Again seen is an indwelling left subclavian catheter with tip not well
 visualized, but likely in the region of the SVC/RA junction. 
 
 Today's film was obtained with more pronounced lordotic positioning and with
 less high-contrast technique.  Allowing for this, the appearance of the right
 lung is similar in terms of dense opacification of the right mid and lower
 zones.  The increased interstitial markings in the right upper lobe are again
 seen, but are less pronounced.  This could reflect either technical factors or
 some interval improvement in CHF findings. The possibility of lymphagetic
 spread accounting for this appearance cannot be excluded. 
 
 The mediastinum is obscured by the right lung opacity, but remains midline. 
 Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region is again noted.  Elsewhere, the left
 upper zone is grossly clear, without CHF or focal infiltrate.  Left pleural
 sulcus shows no effusion.  Small nodular opacity immediately above the left
 lateral costophrenic sulcus is noted, not fully characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible slight improvement in the degree of increased interstitial
 markings in the right upper zone.  Dense opacification of the right mid and
 lower zones persists.
 
 2.  Patchy opacity at the medial left base is similar to prior.  
 
 3.  ?small focal nodular density in the left costophrenic angle laterally.
 
 3.  No CHF.
