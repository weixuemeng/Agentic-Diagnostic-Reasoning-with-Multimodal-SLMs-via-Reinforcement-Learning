                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Known right bronchial stents are not well visualized on this
 portable radiograph.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has apparently
 slightly decreased in size, and there remains diffuse opacification of the
 right middle and right lower lobes, which could reflect atelectasis due to
 central airway obstruction or from the adjacent pleural effusion.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities in the right lung could reflect lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis in the setting of known thoracic malignancy, but asymmetrical
 pulmonary edema is an additional consideration.  Slight worsening of
 atelectasis at the left lung base, with adjacent small left pleural effusion.
 This obscures a known lung mass in this region, more fully characterized on CT
 of ___.
