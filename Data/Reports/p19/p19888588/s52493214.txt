                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup right lower lobe opacity, patient with history of
 TB exposure, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, patient describes ongoing
 fatigue.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Right middle lobe opacity
 described in prior study has almost completely resolved.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities.  Bi-apical pleuroparenchymal scarring, right greater than
 left, likely due to old TB infection, is stable.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
