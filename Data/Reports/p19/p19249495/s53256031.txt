                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with incr dyspnea, lung mass on CT  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Numeral bilateral pulmonary nodules/masses are again seen. The largest is
 located within the right lower lobe with some areas of central lucency better
 seen on the lateral view and prior chest CT. Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted. There is a moderate hiatal hernia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases. Given significant burden of disease,
 evaluation for subtle new opacity is limited although none is definitively
 seen.
