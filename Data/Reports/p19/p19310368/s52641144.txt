                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from carina.  An enteric
 tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, through the stomach, and off
 the inferior borders of the film.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is demonstrated.  Left perihilar opacity is associated with left
 upper lobe volume loss, and is concerning for underlying malignancy.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, asymmetrically pronounced on the left.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Lungs appear
 hyperinflated with probable emphysematous changes in the right apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Left perihilar opacity concerning for underlying malignancy.  Further
 assessment with chest CT is recommended, if not done previously.  There
 appears to be associated left upper lobe volume loss.
 3. Mild asymmetric pulmonary vascular congestion, more pronounced on the left.
