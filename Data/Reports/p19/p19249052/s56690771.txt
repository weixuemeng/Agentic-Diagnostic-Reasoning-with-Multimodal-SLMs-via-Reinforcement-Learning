                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with aortic dissection.  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:41 a.m.
 
 New ET tube is too low, ending 9.3 mm above the carina, suggest pulling it
 back at 3 cm. Left subclavian line is in adequate position in lower SVC. 
 There is also an NG tube in the stomach.  The lung volumes are higher with
 improvement of right lower lung atelectasis which could be due to new
 intubation.  Bilateral overlaying pleural effusion with left lower lobe
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New ET tube is too low, suggest pulling it back 3 cm.
 2.  Improvement of lung volumes is due to recent intubation.
 3.  Stable bilateral layering pleural effusion with left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
