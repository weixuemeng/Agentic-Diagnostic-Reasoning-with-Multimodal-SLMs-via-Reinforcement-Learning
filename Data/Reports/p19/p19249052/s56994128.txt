                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year old female with recent chest tube placement; she is
 post-operative day ___ from an ascending aortic repair.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and torso CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy and sternotomy wires are in place.  A pleural
 pigtail catheter projects over the right costophrenic angle.  A left PICC tip
 terminates at the upper-to-mid SVC.  A thin tubular structure terminating in
 the right axilla may represent an additional peripherally placed IV line. 
 Trace apical pneumothorax may be present, but there is no large pneumothorax,
 mediastinal shift, or diaphragmatic flattening.  Crescentic lucency along the
 lateral aspect of the right chest represents air within a skinfold.  The heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.  Retrocardiac opacity persists, and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a moderate pleural
 effusion there.  Minimal right basal atelectasis is present, but no large
 pleural effusion exists on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Trace apical pneumothorax without appreciable right pleural effusion.
 2.  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with continued retrocardiac
 consolidation - considerations include atelectasis or pneumonia.
