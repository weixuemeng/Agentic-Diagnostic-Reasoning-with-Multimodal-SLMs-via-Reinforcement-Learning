 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  There is a right apical chest tube.  There is
 a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and
 appearance of the mediastinum are unchanged.  Probably large left and
 small-to-moderate right effusions have increased associated with increasing
 adjacent atelectasis.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.  Sternal wires are aligned.
