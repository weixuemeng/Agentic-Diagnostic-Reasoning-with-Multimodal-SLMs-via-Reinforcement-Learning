                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post ascending aorta repair for type A
 dissection here for assessment of pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 2:35.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates intact median
 sternotomy wires and interval removal of an enteric tube and right chest tube
 and, with minimal subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall.  There is
 somewhat similar mild perihilar vascular congestion and stable moderate left
 pleural effusion and increased small right pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis.  Coarse calcifications along the aortic arch is unchanged.  The
 upper lungs remain relatively well aerated.  Previously seen tiny right apical
 pneumothorax is no longer appreciable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right chest tube without discernible
 pneumothorax.
