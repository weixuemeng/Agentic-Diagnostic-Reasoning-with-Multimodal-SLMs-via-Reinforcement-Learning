                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after intubation for
 possible aspiration.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  The Dobbhoff tube
 passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the stomach.  The left
 subclavian line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The NG tube passes below
 the diaphragm terminating in the stomach as well.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are unchanged.  Substantial prominence of the pulmonary artery is
 demonstrated, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Extensive
 parenchymal opacities are demonstrated.  Bilateral pleural effusion is
 re-demonstrated as well.  The patient has a known aortic focal bleeding, as
 demonstrated on ___ study that was treated surgically.
