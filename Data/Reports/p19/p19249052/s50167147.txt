                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is the small right apical pneumothorax.  This is similar in size
 compared to films from the prior evening.  Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
 redistribution, and bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.  There are
 bilateral lower lobe areas of volume loss/infiltrate marrow that are slightly
 more prominent on the current film.  The feeding tube tip is off the film. 
 The right subclavian line with tip at the cavoatrial junction is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. CHF with increased effusions compared to prior.  Cannot rule out underlying
 infectious infiltrate.
 
 2. Unchanged pneumothorax
