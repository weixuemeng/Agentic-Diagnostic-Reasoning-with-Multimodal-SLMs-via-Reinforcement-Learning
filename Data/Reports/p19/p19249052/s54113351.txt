                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ascending aorta replacement post pull of chest tube,
 rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since previous exam right-sided chest tube has been removed.  Minimal right
 apical pneumothorax is unchanged, measuring 3 mm.  Left lower lobe
 consolidation reflecting probably a combination of atelectasis and moderate
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  The right axillary PICC line has been removed.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided chest tube has been pulled and minimal residual right apical
 pneumothorax is unchanged.
 2.  The remaining of the exam is stable with left lower lobe opacification
 which could be a mixture of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
