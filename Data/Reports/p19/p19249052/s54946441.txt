                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion with known subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and repair of ascending
 aorta.  There is similar marked enlargement of both the left atrial appendage
 and main pulmonary artery, accounting for enlarged lobular left upper cardiac
 borders.  The lower part of the chest is partly excluded, making it difficult
 to exclude very small effusions but there is some degree of retrocardiac
 opacification suggested on the frontal view only.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible retrocardiac opacification, although without correlate
 on the lateral view, perhaps an artifact.  If there is persistent concern for
 an evolving pulmonary process, repeat radiographs showing the entirety of the
 lung bases could be considered in short-term follow-up.
