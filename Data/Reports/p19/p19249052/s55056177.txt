                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post ascending aortic repair. 
 Study requested for evaluation of effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided PICC line tip terminates at the mid SVC.  The tip of an
 additional catheter is seen terminating in the axilla on the right. 
 Tracheostomy tube projects over the thoracic midline.  As compared to prior
 chest radiograph from ___, there is a dense consolidation in the
 right lower lobe extending superiorly towards the minor fissure. There has
 been interval increase of the right sided pleural effusion.  There is a right
 sided perihilar opacity which may occupy the superior segment of the right
 lower lobe.  A persistent left-sided pleural effusion precludes the ability to
 see through the heart, cannot exclude retrocardial atelectasis. There is mild
 superimposed pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Increased large area of dense consolidation occupying the right lower lobe
 with indeterminate quantity of effusion.  
 
 2. Persistent left pleural effusion.
