                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube and midline drain with
 bilateral chest tubes remaining in place, with no visible pneumothorax on this
 supine radiograph.  Nasogastric tube continues to terminate below the
 diaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance in the
 post-operative setting.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 perihilar edema.  Worsening more confluent opacity in the right lung base
 could reflect dependent edema and atelectasis, but other process such as
 aspiration or developing pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
