                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural pigtail catheter placement status post ascending
 aortic replacement, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___. 
 
 Technique:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  A right pleural pigtail catheter again projects over the right
 costophrenic angle.  A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating in the upper to mid SVC.  A right PICC is again noted with the tip
 terminating at the level of the right axilla.  There is no definitive evidence
 of pneumothorax.  There is slightly increased opacification of the left lung
 base likely reflecting a combination of moderate left pleural effusion and
 underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  Right basilar atelectasis is
 slightly improved from the most recent prior study.  Enlargement of the
 cardiac mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Calcification of the aortic knob
 and descending thoracic aorta is re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definitive pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Right PICC terminating at the level of the right axilla, as before.  
 
 3.  Slightly increased moderate left pleural effusion and underlying
 atelectasis or consolidation.  
 
 4.  Improved right basilar atelectasis.
