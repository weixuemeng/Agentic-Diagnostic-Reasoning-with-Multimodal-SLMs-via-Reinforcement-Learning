                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with enteral feeding tube placement,
 check position of enteric tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-erect
 position.  A series of eight images have been obtained with subsequent lower
 more abdominal orientation so to finally identify the tip of line.  Comparison
 is made with the next preceding two portable image series the preceding day. 
 Status post sternotomy, cardiac enlargement and evidence of bypass surgery as
 before.  Pulmonary congestive pattern unchanged.  No evidence of new
 infiltrates or pneumothorax.  Subclavian central venous line as before.  The
 Dobbhoff line is seen to pass through the entire esophagus and reaches the
 abdominal area.  There exists a right-sided chest tube apparently placed from
 below, reaching the right lateral and posterior pleural sinus.  The
 right-sided pleural sinus is rather free from any significant fluid
 accumulation.  On a subsequent image, the Dobbhoff line is seen in the
 apparently distended stomach, in caudal direction, but not seen entirely.  On
 the last pair of images, the Dobbhoff line assumes a large semicircular curve
 in an apparently distended stomach, points with its tip towards the region of
 the pylorus.  It has not advanced further into the duodenum.
 
 The referring physician, ___, could not be paged.  It is recommended
 to identify goal of enteric tube placement to monitor imaged taking more
 effectively.
