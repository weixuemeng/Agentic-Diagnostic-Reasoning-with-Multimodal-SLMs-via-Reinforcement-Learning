 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and shortness of breath  // eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral

 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle patchy lingular opacity most likely due to atelectasis, less likely
