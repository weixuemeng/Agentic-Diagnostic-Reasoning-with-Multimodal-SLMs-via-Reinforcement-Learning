 identified within the right lower lobe, correlating with a similar region of
 density seen on the lateral projection, which may represent a small
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary
 edema identified.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.
