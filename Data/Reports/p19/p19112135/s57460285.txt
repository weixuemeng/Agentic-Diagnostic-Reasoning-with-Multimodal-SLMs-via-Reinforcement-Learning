                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malaise, weakness and hyponatremia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The heart remains mildly to moderately enlarged.  Aorta is
 tortuous and calcified, similar to the prior study.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  No pulmonary edema is
 present.  Patchy opacities in both lung bases may reflect atelectasis. 
 Calcified granuloma in the right upper lung field is unchanged.  Anterior
 osteophytes are seen within the thoracic spine spine.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities possibly reflecting
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.
