                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place, as before.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild cardiomegaly. 
 Flattening of hemidiaphragms suggest hyperinflation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. A small calcification projecting over the right
 upper lobe suggests a parenchymal granuloma, not significantly changed. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. Moderate anterior osteophytes are noted
 along several lower thoracic levels, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
