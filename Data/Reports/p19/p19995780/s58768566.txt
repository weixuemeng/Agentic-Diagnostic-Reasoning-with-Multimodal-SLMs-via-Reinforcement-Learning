                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT scan of ___ and prior chest
 radiograph dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Cardiomediastinal widening is stable in the postoperative
 period.  Moderate partially loculated left pleural effusion is again
 demonstrated, and has slightly decreased in size overall. However, an
 intrafissural component has increased.  On the right, a small-to-moderate 
 pleural effusion has slightly increased in size and may be slightly loculated
 laterally.  Increased opacity in the retrosternal space is consistent with
 known postoperative fluid collection as seen on recent CT of ___.
 Bibasilar atelectasis adjacent to the pleural effusion is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral partly loculated pleural effusions and retrosternal
 fluid collection.
