                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, chest tube  // ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray dated ___ at 15:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present approximately 6.2 cm above the Carina. An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off the film. A left subclavian
 central line is present, tip over mid SVC. 2 left-sided chest tubes are
 present, 1 with a pigtail configuration.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Again seen are is upper
 zone redistribution, interstitial edema, and mild vascular blurring,
 consistent with mild CHF and similar to the prior film. There is patchy
 opacity at both lung bases. There is also retrocardiac density, consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and or consolidation. Triangular opacity at the
 right lung base is more pronounced and could represent subsegmental
 atelectasis minimally displaced left posterior sixth rib fracture again noted.
 
 No gross pneumothorax, though a subtle pneumothorax might not be apparent on
 this film. Prominent subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall an
 overlying pectoralis muscle. A smaller amount of subcutaneous emphysema is
 seen along the right chest inferiorly and in the right pectoralis muscle.
 
 Multiple bilateral rib fractures, left clavicular fracture, an left scapular
 fracture are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumothorax detected, though small pneumothorax might be obscured
 by overlying tubing and subcutaneous emphysema. More pronounced triangular
 opacity at the right base --___ subsegmental atelectasis. Otherwise,
 doubt significant interval change.
