                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  The ___ sentence in the impression should read, "The increase in
 ___ of the cardiac silhouette between ___ and ___ suggests
 that the increase in generalized opacification of both lungs is due largely to
 pulmonary edema."

 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:06 AM
  Increased bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations; although
  these most likely represent atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusions,
  other causes of consolidation such as infection or hemorrhage cannot be
  excluded. Hardware appears similarly positioned. Extensive left sided
  subcutaneous emphysema persists. Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 23:58 on
  ___ at time of initial review in response to wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ARDS w/new desat  // desat
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:53.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cyst ___ of the cardiac silhouette increased substantially between ___ and ___, suggesting that much of the increase in opacification
 in both lungs is due to worsening pulmonary edema accompanied by increasing
 moderate bilateral pleural effusion. The new findings obscure what was
 probably right lower lobe pneumonia. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest
 wall has improved since earlier studies.  There is no clear evidence of
 pneumothorax, with the left upper pigtail pleural drainage catheter in place.
 ET tube tip in standard position.  Esophageal tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.
