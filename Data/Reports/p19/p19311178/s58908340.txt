                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, status post chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 5:50 a.m.
 
 Again seen is an ET tube approximately 5.4 cm above the carina, an NG tube
 which extends beneath the diaphragm off the film, and a left subclavian
 central line tip over mid SVC.  Two left-sided chest tubes are present, one
 with a pigtail configuration.  
 
 There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, this is either slightly larger or
 unchanged.  There is patchy opacity at the right lung base with triangular
 opacity similar to the prior film.  There is subcutaneous emphysema on both
 sides of the chest.   No definite pneumothorax is detected at this time.  The
 patient has  multiple known fractures including fractures in the right upper
 chest. Old, healed right clavicle fracture again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Two left-sided chest tubes.  No definite pneumothorax detected.Please note
 that a subtle pneumothorax might not be evident on this film.
 
 2.  Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 equivocally slightly increased compared with earlier the same day.  
 
 3.  Patchy opacity at right base, much of which is slightly improved compared
 with earlier the same day, though the triangular opacity which could represent
 some segmental atelectasis is unchanged.
