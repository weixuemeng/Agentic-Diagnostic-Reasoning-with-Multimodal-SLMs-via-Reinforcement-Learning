                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to previous study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of tracheostomy tube, terminating within the
 trachea at approximately the level of the thoracic inlet.  No evidence of
 pneumomediastinum or definite pneumothorax.  Allowing for marked patient
 rotation on the current study, there has not been an appreciable change in the
 appearance of the chest compared to the recent study of earlier the same date.
