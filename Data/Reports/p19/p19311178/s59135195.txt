                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for
 removal of a nasogastric tube.  Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in
 place, with no visible pneumothorax.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is
 suggestive of lobar collapse, likely on the basis of mucus plugging. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by moderate edema.  Worsening
 airspace opacity in right lower lung could reflect asymmetrical edema
 co-existing with previously described atelectasis, continued followup is
 suggested to exclude a site of infection if warranted clinically.  Increasing
 moderate right pleural effusion and unchanged small-to-moderate left effusion.
 Multifocal post-traumatic abnormalities have been more fully detailed on CT
 exams.
