                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple traumatic injuries after motor
 vehicle crash including C4 spinous process fracture, C5/L2/L3/L4 transverse
 process fractures.  // eval for subcutaneous emphysema at Chest tube site
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:06, ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Not only is the left pneumothorax large, but the version of the hemidiaphragm
 raises the possibility hemodynamic tension, best evaluated clinically. The
 persistence of pneumothorax despite replacement of the pleural drain suggests
 that the new drain may be fissural. Right pneumothorax is small, probably
 persistent at the base of the hemi thorax, despite the apical pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter. Previous pulmonary edema has largely cleared. Residual
 opacification in the right lower lobe could be some atelectasis. Heart size is
 normal, decreased substantially since ___. Small pneumomediastinum is
 clinically insignificant.
 
 Left to subclavian catheter ends in the upper SVC. ET tube in standard
 placement.  Findings were discussed by telephone with the clinical service at
 the 10:15 on ___.
