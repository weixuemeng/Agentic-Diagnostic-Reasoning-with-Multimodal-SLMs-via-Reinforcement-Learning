 endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable. 
 Mild pulmonary edema has minimally decreased from the prior exam.  Bibasilar
 opacities are again seen, minimally improved from the prior study and may
 represent atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded.  A vertical area
 of lucency paralleling the left lower thoracic vertebra is unchanged and
 represents a small to moderate anterior, medial left pneumothorax not
 significantly changed in size from the prior study.

 2. Bibasilar opacities, minimally improved from the prior study may represent
 atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded.
