                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M MVC unrestrained driver ejected from car w/SAH, IPH, SDH,
 nasal bone fracture, C4, C5 fractures, comminuted skull base fracture, b/l
 ptx, b/l rib fractures, b/l pulmonary contusions, pelvic fractures, lumbar
 fractures, L scapula fx w/acute lung injury, hypoxic and hypercarbic
 respiratory failure  // eval for interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 Followup
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, increased severe leftward mediastinal shift
 and now complete left lung opacification is due to worsening left lung
 collapse.  Right lower lung opacification, probably pneumonia, is stable. No
 large right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There is likely a
 small left pleural effusion.  Multiple rib fractures, bilateral clavicle
 fractures and a left scapular fracture are again identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe leftward mediastinal shift and the sudden left lung opacification is
 due to worsening left lung collapse.
