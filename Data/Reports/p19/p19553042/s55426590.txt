                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough for one week.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Slight prominence of the right hilum
 is also stable.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  Given this, patchy
 bibasilar opacities are seen, which while could relate to underlying edema,
 raises a concern for multifocal infection.  There is also mid lung
 atelectasis.  There is prominence of interstitial markings bilaterally.  This
 may be due to underlying edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Stable prominence
 of the right hilum.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to multifocal infection
 superimposed on mild interstitial edema depending on the clinical scenario.
