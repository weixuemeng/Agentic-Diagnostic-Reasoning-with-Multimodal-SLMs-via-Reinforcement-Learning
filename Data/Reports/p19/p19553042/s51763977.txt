                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia follow up.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged
 from prior exam.  There is persistent mild pulmonary edema and in this setting
 is difficult to discretely identify pneumonia.  Bibasilar patchy opacities are
 relatively unchanged compared to prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged pulmonary edema with no change in appearance of bibasilar patchy
 opacities.  Infection is not excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.
