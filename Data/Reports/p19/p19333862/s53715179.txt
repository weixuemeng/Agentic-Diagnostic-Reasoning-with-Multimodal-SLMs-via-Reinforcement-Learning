                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fatigue and cough  // evaluate for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate to large left pleural effusion, increased in size since
 the prior study.  There is likely associated atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 posterior right costophrenic angle suggests a small right pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary lesions, including dominant left upper lobe mass were better
 assessed on CT.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable in
 size.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion, with
 associated atelectasis.  At least the left pleural effusion appears increased
 in size as compared to the prior study.  Previously seen pulmonary lesions
 better assessed on CT.
