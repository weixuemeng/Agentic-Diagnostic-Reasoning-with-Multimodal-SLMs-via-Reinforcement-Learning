                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening effusion  // f/u pleural effusion
 post CT placement, please obtain at 5am on ___ for IP review
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, left pigtail pleural catheter
 has been replaced or repositioned, with apparent slight decrease in size of
 small left pleural effusion.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion appears
 slightly larger although positional differences may contribute to this
 apparent change.  Bibasilar atelectasis has also apparently slightly worsened
 in the interval.
