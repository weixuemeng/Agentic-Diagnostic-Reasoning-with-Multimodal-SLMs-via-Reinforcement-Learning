                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with metastatic melanoma now with anasarca, known pulmonary
 metastasis // r/o infection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   As compared with recent CT chest
 from ___, bilateral pleural effusions persist, left greater than
 right.  There is increasing collapse of the left lower lobe.  A left perihilar
 opacity corresponds with a left upper lobe metastatic lesions seen on recent
 CT.  Additional scattered nodular foci within the lungs are consistent with
 metastatic disease better assessed on prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 edema.  Heart size appears grossly unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is stable. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening left lower lobe collapse with bilateral pleural effusions again
 noted left greater than right.  Difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia
 in the left lower lung.  Scattered metastatic lesions better assessed on prior
 CT.
