                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral view is slightly suboptimal due the patient's overlying arm. 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a
 small/trace right pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to
 mildly enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  Right paratracheal opacity is stable likely representing prominent
 vascular structure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small/trace right pleural effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Persistent
 mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
