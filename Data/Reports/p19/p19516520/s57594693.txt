                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent dx pneumonia, now worsening.  //
 pneumonia/effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The appearance of the chest is similar to 2 days prior with opacities in the
 left mid to lower lung including the lingula and the right mid to lower lung,
 worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.  Subtle opacity previously seen in the
 right upper to mid lung is less well seen on the prior study and may have
 decreased in extent.  Trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Mild
 biapical pleural thickening is re- demonstrated.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible slight improvement in focal right upper to mid lung opacity seen on
 the prior study.  Otherwise, no significant interval change in findings
 worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.
 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
