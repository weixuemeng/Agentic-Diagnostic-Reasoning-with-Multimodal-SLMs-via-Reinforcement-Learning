 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Consolidative opacity within the left lung base, mostly within the
 left lower lobe, is compatible with pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.

 Left basilar pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended
 to ensure resolution of this finding.
