                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after AVR and CABG.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Postoperative cardiomediastinal widening was most severe on ___,
 accompanied by moderate left pleural effusion.  Subsequently, there has been
 some slow decrease in the extent of mediastinal widening, and initially in the
 volume of left pleural effusion, but moderate volume of left pleural fluid has
 increased since ___.  Smaller right pleural effusion has remained stable.
 Concurrence of dominant left pleural effusion and persistent widening of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette raise possibility of post-pericardiotomy
 syndrome, but variety of other combinations can produce same findings,
 including slowly resolving mediastinal hematoma and atypical left-sided
 predominant pleural effusion due to volume overload or subdiaphragmatic
 pathology such as pancreatitis.  The right lung is perfectly clear and there
 is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is present.  Left upper lung is
 essentially clear.  Lower lobe atelectatic.
