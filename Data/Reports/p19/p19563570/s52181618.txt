 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded.

 definite consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  On the lateral view, a relatively dense well
 circumscribed 1 cm nodule is again seen, unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Well-circumscribed nodule either within the anterior left lung or anterior
 mediastinum.  The nodule is stable since ___ but should be assessed with CT,
