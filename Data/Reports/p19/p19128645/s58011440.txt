                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present, which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears moderately enlarged, not substantially changed from
 the prior study.  The aorta is mildly unfolded with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted diffusely.  Hilar contours are similar with no evidence
 for pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 is detected.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Pneumonia or aspiration at the lung bases cannot be completely excluded.
