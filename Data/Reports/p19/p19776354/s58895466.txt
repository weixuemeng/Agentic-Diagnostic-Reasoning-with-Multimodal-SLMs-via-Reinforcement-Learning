 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  Plate-like opacities at the lung
 bases are most consistent with minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax, however.
