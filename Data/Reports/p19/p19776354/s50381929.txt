                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  There is persistent blunting of the
 costophrenic angle suggesting trace pleural effusions.  Minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with persistent blunting of the costophrenic angles may be
 due to trace pleural effusions.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
