                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube removal, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Multiple skin folds should not be confused
 with pneumothoraces.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Left transvenous
 pacemaker leads are in standard positions.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are probably unchanged.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has slightly worsened. 
 Left lower lobe opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis.
 
 Spinal hardware is partially imaged.
