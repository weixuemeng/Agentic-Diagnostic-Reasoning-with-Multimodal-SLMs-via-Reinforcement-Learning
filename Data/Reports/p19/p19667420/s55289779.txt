                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the current radiograph, the endotracheal tube cannot be seen. 
 Apparently, the patient has been extubated.  As a consequence, the lung
 volumes have decreased.  There is moderate fluid overload and the presence of
 small pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  Moderate atelectasis and moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia.
