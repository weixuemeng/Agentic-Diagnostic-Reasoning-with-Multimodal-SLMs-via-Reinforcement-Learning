                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD with increased SOB, cough and anorexia.
 // r/o pulmonary edema versus Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, right-sided pleural
 effusion has minimally improved.  Left-sided pleural effusion, with fissural
 fluid, appears loculated and is unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, suggestive of emphysema.  There is
 mild central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Left pectoral cardiac pacing device with dual leads following their expected
 courses to the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable left pleural effusion appears loculated with fissural fluid. 
 Minimally improved right pleural effusion.
 2. No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
 3. Hyperinflated lungs with flattening of bilateral hemidiaphragms, suggestive
 of emphysema.
 4.  No radiographic findings suggestive of pulmonary embolism, though this
 exam alone cannot confirm or exclude pulmonary embolism.
