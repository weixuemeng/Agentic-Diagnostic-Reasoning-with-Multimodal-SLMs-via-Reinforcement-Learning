                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Endotracheal tube is in unchanged position, terminating in the mid thoracic
 trachea.  A right subclavian catheter extends to the mid SVC.  Left pectoral
 pacer with two trans-subclavian leads is unchanged. There are sternotomy wires
 and thoracolumbar fusion hardware, incompletely assessed.  The upper lungs
 remain well aerated, with slight decrease in pulmonary edema.  The opacities
 at the bases again reflect the presence of effusions.  There is no opacity to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Known left rib fractures are not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable position of support and monitoring devices.  Unchanged
 effusions.  No evidence of pneumonia or new vascular congestion.
