                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evidence of
 a large hiatal hernia is again seen.  No definite new focal consolidation. 
 There is no large pleural effusion, although trace pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude posteriorly.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Multiple old left-sided rib
 fractures are again demonstrated.  Degenerative changes are again seen along
 the spine, although not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of large hiatal hernia again seen.  No definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
