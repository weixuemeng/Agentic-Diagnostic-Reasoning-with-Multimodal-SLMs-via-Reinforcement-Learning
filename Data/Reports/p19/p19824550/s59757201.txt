                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malaise, vomiting and abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with
 diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Chain sutures are seen within the right lung
 base.  There is minimal streaky opacity in the lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic
 spine.  On the lateral view, dilated loops of small bowel are partially
 imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
