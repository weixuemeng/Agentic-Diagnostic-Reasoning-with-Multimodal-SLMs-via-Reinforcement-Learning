                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear.  There are
 possible very small pleural effusions bilaterally.  A large amount of free
 intraperitoneal air is evident and is likely explained by the patient's recent
 surgery one day earlier.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Large amount of free intraperitoneal air, likely due to recent pelvic
 surgery.  Clinical correlation suggested.
