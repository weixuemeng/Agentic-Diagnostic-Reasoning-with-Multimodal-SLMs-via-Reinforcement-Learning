                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:30
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate change in endotracheal tube and central line
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___. 
 Comparison is also made to more recent portable chest studies from ___
 which are in PACS under a separate medical record number.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 14:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of multiple tubes and lines as described: endotracheal
 tube has its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina; right internal jugular
 central line has its tip in the proximal SVC; and nasogastric tube coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach.  The patient is
 markedly rotated to the left.  The heart is likely upper limits of normal in
 size given portable technique.  There is worsening diffuse bilateral airspace
 process, most likely representing moderate pulmonary edema, although diffuse
 pneumonia could also have this appearance.  In addition, there is increasing
 focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region which likely reflects a
 combination of compressive atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion. 
 Superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded and therefore clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Calcification in the
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
