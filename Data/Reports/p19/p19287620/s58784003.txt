                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, altered mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable hilar
 contours.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the aortic arch.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There are bibasilar opacifications, left
 greater than right which may represent atelectasis though superimposed
 infectious process or aspiration is not excluded.   No pneumothorax
 identified.  Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Multilevel degenerative changes are present in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacification which may reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia.   Clinical correlation is advised. Possible trace pleural
 effusions.
