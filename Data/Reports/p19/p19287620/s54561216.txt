                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 6:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia and respiratory distress,
 question pneumonia versus edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 2:24.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 6:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient continues to be rotated, although overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours appear to be stable.  There are patchy bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, which may reflect atelectasis, especially
 in the setting of a small left effusion.  However, aspiration or pneumonia
 should also be considered.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  Degenerative
 changes in the visualized thoracic spine.
