                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new hypotension and tachypnea status post
 trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph dated ___ at approximately
 5 p.m. and CT chest dated ___ at approximately 9:00 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably.  Per
 technologist's report, the patient was unable to cooperate for the exam and
 was stabilized by the ED resident, who approved the image.
 
 FINDINGS:  Very limited view of the chest without obvious pneumothorax or
 edema.  The patient is rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, but an enlarged calcified aorta is again noted.  Right lower lung
 nodule is obscured.  Note is made of a large right calcified thyroid nodule. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very limited study due to patient rotation without evidence for
 large pneumothorax.
