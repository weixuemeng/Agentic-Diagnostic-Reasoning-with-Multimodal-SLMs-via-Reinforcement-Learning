                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with NSTEMI.  Please evaluate for pneumothorax or
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 
 Single frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low. There is mild enlargment of the cardiac silhouette.
 Mild widening of the mediastinal contour is likely due to low lung volumes. 
 Mild patchy opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax, large pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis. No pneumonia or pneumothorax seen.
