                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with substernal chest pain.  Question pneumonia
 or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable mildly
 prominent cardiac silhouette, accentuated by low lung volumes.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The lungs are
 clear with the exception of trace if any bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle may be related to presence of a pericardial fat
 pad.  There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.  Minimal multilevel
 lower thoracic spondylosis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process such as
 pneumonia. Mild left costophrenic blunting likely due to pericardial fat pad. 
 No pneumothorax.
