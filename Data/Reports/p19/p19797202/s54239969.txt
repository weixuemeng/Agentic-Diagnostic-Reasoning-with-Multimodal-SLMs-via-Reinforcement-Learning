                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest, new hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 15:50, CT torso ___
 at 15:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube remains in unchanged position.  The enteric tube tip
 terminates at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged, and
 should be advanced by approximately 13 cm such that the side port is within
 the stomach.  There is interval improvement in aeration of the right upper
 lobe with continued atelectasis noted.  Patchy left upper lobe and bibasilar
 airspace opacities otherwise appear grossly unchanged, concerning for
 aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe.
 2. Persistent patchy left upper lobe and bibasilar airspace opacities
 compatible with aspiration.
 3. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 4. Enteric tube tip terminates at the gastroesophageal junction and should be
 advanced by approximately 13 cm.
