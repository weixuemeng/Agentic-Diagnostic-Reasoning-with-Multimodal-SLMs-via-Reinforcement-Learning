                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent knee surgery, right arm PICC
 line placement, check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated, but no
 local contour abnormalities identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free, and no evidence of
 acute pulmonary infiltrates is present.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical
 area.  Accentuated high contrast copies were provided both for frontal and
 lateral views; one can barely identify a somewhat concordat structure
 resembling a PICC line to be located in the right axillary area.  It cannot be
 followed into the pulmonary area with certainty.  Referring physician, ___
 ___, was paged to clarify PICC line technique that has been used. 
 Telephone contact was established with Dr. ___ at 2:30 p.m.  It was
 noted that the patient was referred from another institution where he had the
 right-sided PICC line for several weeks.  Contrast densities of lines can be
 lost can be lost, but it is also possible that the quality of the PICC line
 placed at an other institution was of lower density.  With this information,
 one can see a suggestion of a line that continues and terminates in the upper
 SVC, some 3 cm above the level of the carina. It can be concluded that if good
 venous blood flow is established in the line, it could continue to be used for
 the remaining treatment.  There is no pneumothorax or any other possible
 placement-related complication.
