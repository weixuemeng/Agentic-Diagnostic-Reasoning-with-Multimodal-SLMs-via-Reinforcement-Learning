                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Asthma, shortness of breath, headache, wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There is subtle opacity at the right lower lobe, which most
 likely relates to atelectasis, however, an early infectious process cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Bilateral spinal rods are
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in opacity at the right lower lobe likely
 represents atelectasis/overlying vascular structures.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, an early consolidation is difficult to exclude.
