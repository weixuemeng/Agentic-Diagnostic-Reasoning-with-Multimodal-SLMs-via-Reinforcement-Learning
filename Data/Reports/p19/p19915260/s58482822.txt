                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain. Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly rotated frontal radiograph.   Frontal and lateral chest radiograph
 demonstrates moderately well inflated clear lungs. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal contour are unremarkable.
 
 The left hilum is mildly enlarged and slightly more prominent when compared to
 ___, but positional differences between the exams limit
 comparison.  Leftward deviation of the trachea is stable. Left upper lobe tiny
 calcified granuloma is stable.
 
 limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Enlarged left hilum has apparently increased in PROM from ___
 but is difficult to compare due to patient rotation.  Recommend a nonurgent
 non rotated radiograph for more accurate direct comparison to previous study.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
