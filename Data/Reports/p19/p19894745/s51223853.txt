                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of breast cancer and cirrhosis.  To evaluate for
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There are multiple relatively discrete mass projected throughout both lobes of
 the lung.  These are concerning for metastatic deposits.  Relatively poor
 inspiratory effort, within these limitations, no definitive effusions are
 identified.  Pneumonic consolidation is not definitively excluded but given
 the widespread metastasis.
 
 Overall little interval change when compared to prior examination.
 CONCLUSION
 
 Little interval change.Widespread metastatic disease
