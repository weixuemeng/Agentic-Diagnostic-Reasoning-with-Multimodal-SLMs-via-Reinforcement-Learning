 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF referred from PCP fo___ ___lb weight gain,
 DOE, volume overloaded on exam  // eval ? cardiomegaly, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hilar engorgement is re- demonstrated with interval increase in interstitial
 markings since the prior study consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  More
 focal right base opacity may relate to fluid overload, but underlying
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Very trace
 right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and cardiac valve replacements.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  More focal right base opacity may relate to fluid
 overload, but infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
