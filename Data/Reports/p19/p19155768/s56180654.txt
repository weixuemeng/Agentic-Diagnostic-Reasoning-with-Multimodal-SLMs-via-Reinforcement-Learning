                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with congestive heart failure, status post EGD,
 presents with low O2 saturation.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates multiple intact
 median sternotomy wires and evidence of prior CABG procedure.  The heart is
 prominent, but likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  There
 are aortic arch calcifications, unchanged.  
 Mild interstitial prominence is long standing and certainly less pronounced on
 current exam. There is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  There is subsegmental atelectasis in the
 retrocardiac region.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema.
