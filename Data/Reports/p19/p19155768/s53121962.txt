                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new fever and CHF  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes remain low.  Improvement of the ventilation in the lower lung
 areas, notably on the right.  The pre-existing signs of pulmonary edema are
 less severe.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus persists and
 could still be caused by a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumonia.
