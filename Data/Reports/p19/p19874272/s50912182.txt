                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Removal of the drain in a patient with effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is a small amount of right pleural effusion still seen, improved since
 the prior study associated with right basal opacity most likely representing
 atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No definitive pneumothorax is
 demonstrated from the current study.  Central venous line tip is not clearly
 seen on both PA and lateral views.
