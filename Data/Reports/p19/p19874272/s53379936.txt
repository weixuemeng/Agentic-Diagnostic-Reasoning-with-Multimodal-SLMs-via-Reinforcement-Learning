                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion.  Pleural drain removed.  New spiking fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate residual right pleural effusion has decreased substantially since
 ___.  There is now the suggestion of focal mass-like consolidation in
 the right mid lung on the frontal view and an unexplained collection of gas
 projecting over the posterior cardiac silhouette on the lateral.  Recommend
 right decubitus views to reevaluate the right lung and see if there is
 pneumonia or even lung abscess present.  Aside from mild atelectasis and small
 left pleural effusion, the left lung and hemithorax are normal.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and generally large and tortuous thoracic aorta are chronic.  No
 pneumothorax.
