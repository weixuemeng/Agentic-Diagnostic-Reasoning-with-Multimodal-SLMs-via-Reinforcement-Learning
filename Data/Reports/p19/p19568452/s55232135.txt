 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Ill-defined opacity within
 the lingula is unchanged compared to the prior exam.  Remainder of the lungs
 are clear.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is seen.
 Small hiatal hernia is demonstrated.  There is eventration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  A VP shunt catheter is noted coursing along the right anterior
 chest wall, but the distal aspect is not clearly visualized.  There is mild
 left basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged rounded opacity within the lingula compatible with
 patient's known malignancy.  No new areas of consolidation identified.
