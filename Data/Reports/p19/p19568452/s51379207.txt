                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic disease to the brain, now dizziness,
 evaluate for an acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A rounded opacity in the left upper lobe is again seen and
 corresponds to known malignancy and is better characterized on previous CT
 with precise measurements not being well delineated.  Heart size is top normal
 and unchanged.  The left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated and left
 basilar atelectasis and scarring are again redemonstrated.  There is no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  A VP shunt is seen coursing through the
 right hemithorax into the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
