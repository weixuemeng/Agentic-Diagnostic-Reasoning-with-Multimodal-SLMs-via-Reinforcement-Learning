 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION:

 pleural fluid, presumably loculated, has not improved significantly.
 
 CT scanning would be essential in delineating the distribution of residual
 pleural fluid and distinguishing it from pleural thickening. Right lung is
 clear. Moderate enlarged of the cardiac silhouette is slightly larger today.
 If there is any clinical concern about purulent pericarditis, echocardiography
 or CT scanning would be indicated.
 
 A shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen.
