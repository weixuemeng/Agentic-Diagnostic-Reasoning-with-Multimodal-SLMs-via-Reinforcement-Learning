                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and weakness with history of metastatic lung cancer.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted.  Known left upper lobe mass
 is not clearly delineated on this study.  There is however a new small to
 moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent opacity suggesting atelectasis. 
 An overlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  A small opacity is noted
 overlying the right middle lobe.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear
 stable.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In this patient with a known left upper lobe mass, there is a new small left
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Overlying infection in this
 region cannot be excluded.  Additionally, a faint opacity is noted over the
 right middle lobe. Further characterization may be obtained with a dedicated
 Chest CT.
