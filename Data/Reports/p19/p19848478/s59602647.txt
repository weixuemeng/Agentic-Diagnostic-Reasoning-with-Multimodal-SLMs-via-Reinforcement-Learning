 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubate  // ett? og?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above level the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses into the left hemi thorax, terminating in the midline
 below the diaphragm.  Please note that on subsequent CT, the enteric tube is
 seen terminating in the proximal stomach.  However, the side port may remain
 high in position.  Low lung volumes persist in there increased bibasilar
 opacities since the prior study which may be due to atelectasis and/or
 aspiration.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
