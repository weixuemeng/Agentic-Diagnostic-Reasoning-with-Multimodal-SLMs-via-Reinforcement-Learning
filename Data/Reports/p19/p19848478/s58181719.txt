 air cannot be definitively excluded.  Gaseous distention of bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lucency in the midline and left subdiaphragmatic region likely represents
 intraluminal air, but extraluminal air cannot be definitively excluded. 
 Consider left lateral decubitus radiographs for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Lucency in the midline and left subdiaphragmatic region
