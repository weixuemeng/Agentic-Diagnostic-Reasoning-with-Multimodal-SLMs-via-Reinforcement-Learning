                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, GERD, dysphagia, question pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax.  Distant history of Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT of the chest,
 abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 clear bilaterally.  Prominent epicardial fat pad accounts for the opacity at
 the left heart border inferiorly.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen, though the left CP angle is partially excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  Patient is known to have mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy due to Hodgkin's lymphoma and overall appearance of the
 mediastinum is stable-to-slightly less thickened along the right paratracheal
 stripe.  Bony structures appear intact.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or other acute process in the chest.  Mediastinal
 prominence is compatible with known lymphadenopathy in the setting of
 lymphoma.
