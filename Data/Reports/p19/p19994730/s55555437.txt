                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are
 patchy new opacities in the left mid-to-lower lung, predominantly in the
 lingula, but streaky in morphology.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There
 are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are
 present along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy new left mid and lower lung opacities, typical in morphology for
 atelectasis, although an infectious etiology is difficult to completely
 exclude based on the imaging.
