 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chronic cough, getting worse  // ?
 pneumonia, mass
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently in ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no radiographic evidence of either pneumonia or heart failure.
 Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting. Heart is
 normal size common is no pleural effusion. Lungs are grossly clear.
 
 Lung nodules noted on in the report of torso CT ___ are not visible
 on the conventional chest radiograph common and would need repeat CT scanning
 to assess growth. That study also the suggested bulge in the posterior wall of
 the trachea at the level of the cricopharyngeus, which could be an indentation
 made by and well-developed upper esophageal sphincter, or could be a tracheal
 mass in the posterior wall.  CT scanning would evaluate both possibilities,
 but the utility of diagnosis should be weighted in light of the patient's age.
