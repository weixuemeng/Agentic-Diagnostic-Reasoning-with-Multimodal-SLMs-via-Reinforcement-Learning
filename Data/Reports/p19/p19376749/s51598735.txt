  pneumonia/aspiration cannot be ruled out.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Patchy opacity in right infrahilar region probably represents a
 combination of patchy atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion. 
 Aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia are additional considerations, and
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.  Within the left
 hemithorax, a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
