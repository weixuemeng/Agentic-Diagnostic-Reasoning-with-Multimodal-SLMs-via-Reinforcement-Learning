                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:49 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man, decreased cardiac output and shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, which may account for greater opacification in the
 right perihilar and lower lung, and it could also be mild asymmetric edema.  I
 would suggest close followup to exclude a developing right lower lobe
 pneumonia, however.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable given the lower
 lung volumes.  Right PIC line ends in the axilla.  Right pleural effusion is
 presumed, but not large.  Left pleural surfaces are normal.
