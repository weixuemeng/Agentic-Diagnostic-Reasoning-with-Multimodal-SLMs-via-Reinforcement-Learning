                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of pulmonary edema, new wheezing and dyspnea.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are enlarged.  Overall, the appearance is stable
 including post-sternotomy wires and post-CABG clips.  The right lower lobe
 opacity appears to be slightly more pronounced than on the prior study and
 might be concerning for worsening pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 There is no increase in pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
