  ET tube satisfactory.  Enteric tube within the stomach.  Right upper extremity
  PICC terminates in the axilla.  Consolidation at the right lung base is
  consistent with pneumonia.  Opacification of the left retrocardiac space could
  also reflect pneumonia.  Mediastinum unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  HIV, chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged normal
 position of the endotracheal tube.  The nasogastric tube is in the stomach. 
 Right PICC line is in correct position.  There is constant appearance of
 bilateral parenchymal opacities, the right opacity is consistent with
 pneumonia, as mentioned in the previous report.  On the left, the retrocardiac
 opacity is more likely to reflect atelectasis.  The appearance of the
 mediastinum is unchanged.
