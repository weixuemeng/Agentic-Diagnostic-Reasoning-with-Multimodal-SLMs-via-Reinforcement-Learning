 INDICATION:  CHF in the setting of sepsis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Lung volumes are low with pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild interstitial
 edema are stable.  However, atelectasis in the right lung base is slightly
 worse.  Pleural effusions are small.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
