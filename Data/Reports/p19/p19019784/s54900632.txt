 IMPRESSION:
 
 Heart is stably enlarged.  The lungs demonstrate ill-defined vasculature,
 suggestive of mild interstitial edema.  There is also patchy opacity at the
 left base, which may reflect patchy atelectasis or be related to the
 interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Subtle lucency underneath the
 right hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum in this recently
 postoperative patient.
