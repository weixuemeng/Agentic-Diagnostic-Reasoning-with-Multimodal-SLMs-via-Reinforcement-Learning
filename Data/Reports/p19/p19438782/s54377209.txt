                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube advanced 5 cm.  Check position.
 
 The upper abdomen is not shown on this film and the position of the
 nasogastric tube cannot be determined.  If it was advanced 5 cm, I would
 suspect it is in a satisfactory position.
