                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and bowel perforation.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with radiograph of the chest from ___, obtained at an outside hospital (___).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 supine portable views of the chest demonstrate interval placement of a right
 internal jugular central venous catheter, which terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, and relatively low lung volumes, and right basilar atelectasis.
 The heart size is top normal and the mediastinum is likely within normal
 limits, allowing for supine portable technique, although hilar prominence
 suggests underlying fluid overload.  Relatively asymmetric opacification in
 the left apex compared to the right, is possibly due to non-cardiogenic edema.
 No large pleural effusion is present and no consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter in appropriate position.  No
 pneumothorax or focal pneumonia.  Left apical haziness could represent a
 component of non-cardiogenic edema, in addition to underlying fluid overload
 and right basilar atelectasis. 
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 9:14 am, after attending review.
