                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for differences in
 degree of rotation, there may be little change.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The right hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen.  This raises
 the possibility of layering effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base.
 
 
 Various monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
