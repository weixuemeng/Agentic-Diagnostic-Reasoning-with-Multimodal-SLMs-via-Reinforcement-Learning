 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged mild,
 probably vascular right paramediastinal opacity at the right lung apex.  No
 acute or new parenchymal opacity.  Minimal bilateral apical thickening.  A 4
 mm soft tissue lung nodule is seen, partly projecting over the eighth rib. 
 This small nodule appears to have been present on the previous examination.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.
