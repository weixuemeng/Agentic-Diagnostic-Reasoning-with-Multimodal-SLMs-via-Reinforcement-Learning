                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CML and neutropenia with worsening cough and diffuse rales. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest when compared to the
 prior study demonstrate new asymmetric opacity at the left base well seen on
 the frontal and in the retrocardiac region, well seen on the lateral,
 corresponding to a left lower lobe pneumonia.  Additionally, there is mild
 increase in interstitial markings concerning for worsening pulmonary edema. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is noted and stable.  Intact median sternotomy
 wires are seen.  A tortuous aorta alters the contour of the mediastinum which
 is otherwise unchanged.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma is clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New asymmetric opacity at the left base consistent with left
 lower lobe pneumonia.  Mild interval worsening of pulmonary edema.
