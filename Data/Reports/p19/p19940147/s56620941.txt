                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CML, to assess for edema and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart on this AP frontal view.  Again there is
 evidence of prior CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires, but no
 evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
