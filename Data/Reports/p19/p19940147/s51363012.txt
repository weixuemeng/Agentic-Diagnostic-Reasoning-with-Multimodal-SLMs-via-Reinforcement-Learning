                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
 
 ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the
 diaphragm.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Increasing opacities in the right
 perihilar region and right lower lobe are worrisome for worsening pneumonia. 
 Component of pulmonary edema is stable.  Left lower lobe pneumonia is stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  There are low lung
 volumes with stable widened mediastinum  due to engorgement of vessels.
