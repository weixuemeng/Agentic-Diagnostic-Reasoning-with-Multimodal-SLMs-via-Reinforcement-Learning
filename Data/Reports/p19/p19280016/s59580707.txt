 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle, seen since at

 given chronicity, may relate to pleural thickening. The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged. Evidence of a hiatal hernia is again seen. Right

 lateral view. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Mediastinal contours are
 stable with calcification of the aorta seen.

 Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Large hiatal hernia. No
