 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with POD6 CABG  // evaluate for effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate left pleural effusion.  , this appears increased compared
 to the prior study however there was likely layering of the pleural effusion
 on the prior study as the patient was semi-erect.  Left lower lobe atelectasis
 versus consolidation.  The right internal jugular catheter is been removed. 
 Median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft sutures are unchanged in
 appearance.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  Suture material is
 seen in the left hemi thorax.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in the left-sided pleural effusion may in fact be due to
 layering of the effusion on the prior study.  Left lower lobe atelectasis
 versus consolidation.
