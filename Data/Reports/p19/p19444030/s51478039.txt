                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CNS lymphoma, new cough and shortness of breath, question pneumonia,
 aspiration. 
 
 CHEST PA and lateral views including lateral on chair.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:07 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior study, inspiratory volumes are lower.  Allowing for
 this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is again enlarged, but probably
 unchanged.  Again seen is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF --  this appears worse, but is likely accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  There is also more focal confluent opacity in the left perihilar
 region.  There are small bilateral effusions, similar, but probably slightly
 larger than the earlier film.  Tubing projects over the chest, but appears to
 lie outside the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 2.  Lower inspiratory volumes, with probable worsening of interstitial
 CHF/interstitial edema.  Small bilateral effusions probably also larger.  
 
 3.  No definite focal infiltrate, but there is more confluent opacity in the
 perihilar area and the possibility of an associated focal pneumonia is
 difficult to completely exclude.
