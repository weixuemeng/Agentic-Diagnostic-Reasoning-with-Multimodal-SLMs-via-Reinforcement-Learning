                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male POD# 5 status post CABG.  Patient now with
 hematocrit drop and possible mediastinal widening on recent chest radiograph. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 postoperative radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is unchanged retrocardiac
 opacification.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on
 the right are unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is evident. 
 Mediastinal contours appear within normal limits given recent cardiac surgery.
 There is no radiographic evidence of developing mediastinal hematoma.  Median
 sternotomy wires appear intact.  There is no interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.  No significant interval change compared to recent prior
 examination.
 2.  No new mediastinal widening to suggest hematoma
