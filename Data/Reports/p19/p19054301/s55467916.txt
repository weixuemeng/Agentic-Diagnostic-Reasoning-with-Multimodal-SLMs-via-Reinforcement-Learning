                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post CABG.  Evaluate for effusion after
 thoracentesis.
 
 An AP portable upright chest radiograph shows significant diminution in what
 was previously a large left pleural effusion.  There is now only some haziness
 in the left costophrenic and cardiophrenic angles and residual overlying
 plate-like subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. Intact sternal wires
 are seen in this patient status post CABG.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Notable decrease in left pleural effusion with residual overlying
 subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.
