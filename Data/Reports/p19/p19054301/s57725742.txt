                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CABG.  Check left effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, stable in
 appearance as compared to the prior study.  There is very slight rightward
 shift of the cardiac silhouette, stable.  There is slight blunting of the
 posterior right costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace right pleural
 effusion.  No focal consolidation is seen in the right lung.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, although not
 well evaluated given the large left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.
