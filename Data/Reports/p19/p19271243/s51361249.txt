                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 underlying emphysematous changes.  There is no convincing focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  A vague opacity in the left lower lobe is likely
 secondary to chronic scarring.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouette is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: No convincing signs of pneumonia.  A vague opacity in the left
 lower lobe is likely secondary to chronic scarring.
