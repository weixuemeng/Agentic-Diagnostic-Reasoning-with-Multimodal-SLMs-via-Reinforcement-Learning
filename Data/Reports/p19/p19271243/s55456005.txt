                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Relative hyperlucency of the upper lobes of the lungs with associated
 attenuated vessels may reflect emphysema in the setting of a history of COPD. 
 Superimposed upon chronic areas of linear opacity in the lower lung is a
 slightly more confluent opacity in the left retrocardiac region, likely
 projecting posteriorly over the lower spine on the lateral view. 
 Additionally, there is a second questionable area of new opacity in the right
 lung base medially.  No pleural effusions are identified, and bones are
 diffusely demineralized, without acute findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for focal left lower lobe (and possibly
 bibasilar) pneumonia.  Considering history of COPD, followup chest x-ray in
 six weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended to document
 complete resolution.  
 
 Findings entered into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
