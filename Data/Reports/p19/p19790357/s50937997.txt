 process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval appearance of bibasilar airspace opacities with
 associated effusion, left greater than right. The imaging appearance would
 favor pulmonary edema rather than aspiration or pneumonia given the time
 interval, but clinical correlation would be recommended.  There is underlying
 biapical parenchymal distortion with extensive bullous changes at the right
 apex consistent with known emphysema.  Interval placement of a right internal
 jugular large bore catheter with its tip in the proximal SVC. Calcification of
 the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac
 size is stable.
