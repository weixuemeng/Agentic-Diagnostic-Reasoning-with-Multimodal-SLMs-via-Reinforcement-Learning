                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute SOB  // eval for heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, with sternotomy wires.  Left-sided 2 lead pacemaker is present,
 with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is indistinct.  There is a right lower lobe opacity, not seen on
 prior examination, concerning for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 context.  A small right pleural effusion may be present. Patchy opacity at the
 left base may represent atelectasis.  Surgical clips are seen in the right
 upper abdomen immediately to the left of midline.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with CHF/ edema.
 
 Right lower lobe opacity, of uncertain etiology or significance.  The
 differential includes atelectasis in the setting of CHF.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical context, it is concerning for pneumonia.  This should be
 followed to assess for evolution/confirm resolution.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest radiographs to assess for
 evolution/resolution of opacity at the right lung base.
