 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is chronic
 deformity of the right humeral head, not fully evaluated, which could be due
 to prior trauma versus severe degenerative change, history of avascular
 necrosis cannot be excluded.
