                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right side rib pain after fall, rule out acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pectoral pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle is unchanged in position. Sternotomy wires, epicardial pacer
 wires and mediastinal clips are constant. The heart is mildly enlarged, which
 accounting for technique, is unchanged.  There is central vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An opacity
 in the right low lung, only appreciated on the frontal view, could reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  There is no rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity of the right lower lung could reflect atelectasis or infection,
 less likely contusion after trauma.
