                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  High chest tube output after sternotomy.  Evaluate lung field, tube
 position. 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:21 p.m.
 
 Compared with prior study, multiple lines and tubes have been removed.  A
 right IJ sheath remains present.  Left-sided chest tube again noted.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  there is upper zone
 re-distribution, but given low lung volumes, no definite CHF.  There is dense
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.   There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base,
 not significantly changed. Minimal blunting of the right and left costophrenic
 angles is also unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of multiple lines and tubes, with left chest
 tube and right IJ sheath remaining present.  Low inspiratory volumes.  No
 definite interval change.
