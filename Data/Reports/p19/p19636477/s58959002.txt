                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 except for slightly more pronounced azygos vein that in combination with
 vascular engorgement might be consistent with mild degree of vascular
 overload.  No definitive evidence of infectious process seen.  The more focal
 appearance of consolidation in the right lower lung most likely related to low
 lung volume and again potentially due to volume overload.
