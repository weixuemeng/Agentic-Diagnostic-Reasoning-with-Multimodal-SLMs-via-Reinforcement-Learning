 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Multifocal predominately linear
 atelectasis is present in both lower lungs.  A more focal patchy opacity in
 the left retrocardiac region may reflect more extensive atelectasis, but
 differential diagnosis includes aspiration and developing infectious
 pneumonia. Small pleural effusions are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis, aspiration or
 early pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
 
 Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
