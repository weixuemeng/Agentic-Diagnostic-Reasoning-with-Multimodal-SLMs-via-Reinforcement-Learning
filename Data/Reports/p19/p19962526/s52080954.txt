                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, fever and right-sided
 rales and rhonchi on examination.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy and previous
 bypass surgery as before.  Mild cardiac enlargement with evidence of coronary
 arterial calcifications, unchanged.  Moderately widened and elongated thoracic
 aorta with significant wall calcifications in arch and descending area, also
 unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  On the frontal view,
 a rather prominent fat pad, occupying the right-sided diaphragmatic angle,
 obscures somewhat the right-sided lung base.  Still when comparing with the
 previous examination, one sees a hazy parenchymal density just lateral to the
 lower lung area, and this finding is confirmed by the lateral view which
 discloses a thickening of the right-sided interlobar fissure and hazy density
 in the middle lobe area which was not present on the previous examination. 
 This finding is compatible with a right middle lobe pneumonia.  No other
 abnormalities are seen.  Followup examination after successful treatment is
 recommended in about two to three weeks.
