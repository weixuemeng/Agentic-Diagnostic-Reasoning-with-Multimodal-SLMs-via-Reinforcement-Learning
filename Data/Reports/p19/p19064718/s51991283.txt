                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs are available from ___, and a CT of the
 torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Streaky opacities at the lung bases suggest minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the
 lungs appear clear.  Pulmonary nodules mentioned in the recent CT report are
 not apparent on radiography.  Bony structures appear similar.  A sclerotic
 upper vertebral body, namely T3, appears likely unchanged, but not well
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Known metastatic disease not well
 assessed on radiography.
