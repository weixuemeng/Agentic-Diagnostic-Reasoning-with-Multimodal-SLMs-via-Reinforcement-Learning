 Left-sided AICD / pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in
 the right ventricle.  Dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 proximal right atrium.  Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette
 is unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings, with probable
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung
 bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis and probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
