                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To evaluate for indwelling port.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change in the
 appearance of the Port-A-Cath, with its tip in the mid portion of the SVC. 
 The remainder of the examination is essentially within normal limits with no
 evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  The mild
 loss of height of L1 is difficult to appreciate on the current study.
