 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Severe necrotizing pancreatitis, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural
 effusions have not substantially decreased nor increased in extent.  They are
 still clearly visible, and better appreciated on the lateral than on the
 frontal image.  No new parenchymal opacities.  The pre-existing areas of
 atelectasis at the lung bases are decreased.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 hilar and mediastinal contours.
