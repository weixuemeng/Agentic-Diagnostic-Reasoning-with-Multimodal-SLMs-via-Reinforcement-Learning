 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatitis with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some increase
 in size of the moderate left pleural effusion with some shift of mediastinal
 contents to the right.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again
 seen.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude
 in the lower lung, especially on the left, if there were appropriate clinical
 symptoms.
