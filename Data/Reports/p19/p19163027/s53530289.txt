                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion has increased in size and is
 associated with adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation at the left base as
 well as elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 slightly shifted towards the right.  On the right, linear atelectasis at the
 right lung base has improved, and a small pleural effusion persists.
 
 An air-fluid level at the region of the left thoracoabdominal junction may be
 within the stomach, but a gas-containing pseudocyst adjacent to the stomach
 could produce a similar appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis and/or consolidation. 
 
 Air-fluid level at the left thoracoabdominal junction may be in the stomach or
 could reflect a pancreatic pseudocyst adjacent to the stomach given history of
 this entity.  Consider CT for further evaluation.
