                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Post pyloric feeding tube is seen, coursing beyond the stomach, off the
 inferior borders of the film.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is slight rightward shift of midline structures which is
 stable.  Moderate left pleural effusion is re- demonstrated, similar in size,
 with adjacent atelectasis.  Linear opacity in the right lung base is new, and
 compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal,
 and there is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are noted within the
 lumbar spine, and levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion.  Right basilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.
