 pneumothorax can be obscured by right chest wall emphysema.  A right chest
 tube is in unchanged position.  Aeration of the left lower lung has improved. 
 Vascular congestion has resolved.  Patient has known calcified pleural plaques
 on the left chest.  There is evidence of loss of volume in the right
 hemithorax status post right lower lobectomy.  Opacity in the lower right
 hemithorax has resolved.  If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
