                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased opacification of the right hemithorax suggesting
 a large pleural effusion with associated lung collapse, noting nearly balanced
 mass effect.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the left. 
 Calcified pleural plaques are again noted along the left mid hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right lung, probably reflecting
 increasing pleural effusion and lung collapse.
