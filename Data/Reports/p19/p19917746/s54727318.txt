 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Again seen is a
 large paramediastinal opacity, similar to the previous exam.  A right pleural
 effusion is again noted.  Increased right basilar opacity may represent
 increasing effusion or pneumonia.  The left lung is relatively clear with
 pleural plaques, unchanged since the previous exam.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right basilar opacity which may represent increasing
 pleural fluid,  pneumonia or a combination of both.
