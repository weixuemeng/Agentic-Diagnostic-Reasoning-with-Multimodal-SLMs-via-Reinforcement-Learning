                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right lower lobectomy
 for lung cancer, followup for interval change.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is a still present right pleural effusion, at least moderate but overall
 decreased slightly since the prior study.  There is also improvement of the
 right lung aeration.  Minimal amount of right apical air collection cannot be
 entirely excluded, unchanged since the prior study.  Minimal apical
 pneumothorax on the left is noted, unchanged. Scarring/atelectasis at the left
 lung base is unchanged as well as pleural calcifications.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged in appearance as well.  Anterior mediastinal air
 cannot be excluded.
 
 Lateral view demonstrates still present small loculated posterior
 hydropneumothorax on the right.
