                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC with worsening right lateral pain,
 worsening SOB  // rib fracture, PNA, effusion, progression
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Read in conjunction with chest CT on ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been no radiographic change since ___. Extensive right pleural
 abnormality, consisting of malignant infiltration and effusion, extending
 along the costal, mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces is unchanged.
 Rightward mediastinal shift reflect its bronchial obstruction paracentral
 malignancy. Subject to the limitations of conventional radiographs which are
 not sensitive in detection of subtle chest cage abnormalities, I see no
 fracture or gross malignant involvement of the ribs. Vertebral alignment, body
 and disk space heights, are intact. Left lung is clear, partially obscured by
 pleural left-sided cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, essentially normal.
 The right-side is obscured by pleural abnormality. No pneumothorax.
