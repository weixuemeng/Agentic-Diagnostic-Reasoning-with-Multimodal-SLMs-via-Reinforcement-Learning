                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with crackles and leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by low lung volumes as well as patient rotation.  Heart
 size is accentuated due to low lung volumes appearing borderline enlarged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is seen without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities within the lung bases presumably reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Previously noted
 focal opacity overlying the left lateral mid lung field is not clearly
 visualized on the current examination.  Multiple clips are again seen within
 the right axilla.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is
 new from ___, but appears to reflect a chronic abnormality.  There
 are mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
