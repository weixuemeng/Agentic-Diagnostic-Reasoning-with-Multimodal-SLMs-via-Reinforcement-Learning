                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ICH, intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube and OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm loops in the stomach and travels
 out of view.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky opacification
 in the retrocardiac space likely represents atelectasis, though
 infection/aspiration is not excluded in the clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.  
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacification, likely atelectasis.
