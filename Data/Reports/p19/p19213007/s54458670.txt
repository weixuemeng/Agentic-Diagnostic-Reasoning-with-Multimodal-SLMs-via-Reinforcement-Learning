                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the region of the pylorus. 
 Nasogastric tube has been removed.
 
 There may be some decrease in retrocardiac opacification.  This suggests that
 it may have reflected atelectasis more than aspiration or pneumonia.
