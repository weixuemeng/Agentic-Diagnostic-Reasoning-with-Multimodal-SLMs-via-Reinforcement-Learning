                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right intracranial hemorrhage, now
 status post extubation.  Study requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm from the carina. Eneteric
 catheter tip terminates at the pylorus. A left subclavian line is seen in the
 region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  There has been interval decrease
 of the lung volumes.  Left lower lobe opacification is unchanged from prior
 examination and could either represent pneumonia or atelectasis. The right
 lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is mild
 cardiomegaly, exaggerated by low lung volumes and by vascular engorgement.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 
 2. Unchanged left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
