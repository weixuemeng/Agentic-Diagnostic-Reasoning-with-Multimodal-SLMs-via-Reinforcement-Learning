                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Craniotomy, now with coughing, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There is continued increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region with some obscuration of the hemidiaphragmatic shadow. 
 This is consistent with atelectasis and small effusion.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
