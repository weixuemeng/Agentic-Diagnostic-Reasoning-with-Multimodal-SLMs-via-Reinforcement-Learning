                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain, evaluate for free air under the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate
 well-expanded lungs.  The cardiomediastinal contour is normal.  The heart is
 normal in size.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base are improved
 compared to the prior examination and likely reflect atelectasis.  Again seen
 is high-density material projecting over the lower right chest, unchanged
 compared to the prior study.   There is no free air under the diaphragm and no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of free air under the diaphragm.
