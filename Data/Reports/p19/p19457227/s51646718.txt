  Overall unchanged since the prior study. Pigtail catheter in right lung base
  still present. Bilateral pulmonary opacities likely represent pulmonary edema,
  more confluent in the right lower lobe. Lucency projecting over the right
  hemidiaphram is less prounounced than the prior exam. If concerned recommend
  upright film to r/o free air.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower right
 hemithorax.  Adjacent lucency at the level of the right hemidiaphragm favors a
 basilar pneumothorax over pneumoperitoneum as the visceral pleural line is now
 evident just below the pigtail pleural catheter site.  A more confluent area
 of opacity persists in the right infrahilar region, and appears to correspond
 to a complex collection in the right lower chest better delineated on recent
 CTA of ___.
