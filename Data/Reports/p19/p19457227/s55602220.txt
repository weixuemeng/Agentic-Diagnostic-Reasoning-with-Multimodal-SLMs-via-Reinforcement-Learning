                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of esophageal
 rupture and known esophageal perforation, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The PICC line is inserted on the left with its tip terminating at the level of
 mid SVC.  There is a slight rightward deviation of the mediastinum, which
 might be a combination of dextroscoliosis as well as right lower lobe
 atelectasis and most likely present loculated pleural effusion.  There is no
 appreciable pneumothorax.  For precise details, please review CT chest,
 abdomen and pelvis obtained the next day.
