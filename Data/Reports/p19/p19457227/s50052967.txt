                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal perforation with lung abscess.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is redemonstration of a pigtail drainage catheter at the
 right lung base with adjacent right infrahilar opacity, similar in appearance
 to prior study.  Persistent widespread parenchymal consolidations are slightly
 increased in density, compatible with worsening edema.  Small right effusion
 is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Esophageal stent is unchanged and
 appears patent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of right infrahilar consolidation with
 adjacent pigtail drainage catheter.  Mildly progressed pulmonary edema.
