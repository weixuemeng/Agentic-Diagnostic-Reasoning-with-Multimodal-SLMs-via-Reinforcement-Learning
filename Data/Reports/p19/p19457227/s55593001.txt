                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chest pain and
 evidence of re-accumulation of effusion.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to the prior study obtained the same day earlier, there is
 interval progression of interstitial opacities in the right hemithorax, that
 potentially may reflect asymmetric edema.  The basal abnormalities are
 unchanged including the position of the pigtail catheter with potentially
 interval decrease in the pneumothorax.
