                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post drainage of fluid collection, question aspiration versus
 acute pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from 3:35 a.m. on ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film, there may have been slight interval clearing of
 the opacity at the right base. Right upper zone remains grossly clear.   No
 CHF, left-sided effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the left base, without other left-sided pulmonary process.  
 
 Again seen is a drain at the right base and a PICC line with tip over
 distalmost SVC.  Also again seen is a stent overlying the lower mediastinum,
 presumably in relation to the esophagus. An additional linear density at the
 upper edge of the stent is noted, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Opacity at right base with drain in place, similar or slightly improved
 compared to prior.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
