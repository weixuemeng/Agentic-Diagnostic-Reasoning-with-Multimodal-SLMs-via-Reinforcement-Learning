                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal perforation right pleural effusion.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest. Right basilar pleural pigtail
 catheter has been removed.  A meniscus/air fluid level at the right lower lung
 identifies an air-fluid collection in the medial right pleural space which is
 likely smaller than on the previous examination given improved visualization
 of the right heart border, though this may also be due to air within the
 collection.  Right lung parenchymal opacities are similarly slightly improved.
 Trace pleural effusion is present on the left.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are left PICC an esophageal stent are unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged to slight interval decrease in now air-fluid collection
 in the medial right pleural space and decrease of right basal parenchymal
 opacities with trace left pleural effusion.
