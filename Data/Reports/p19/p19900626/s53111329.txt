 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with liver failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes
 seen with linear bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are noted.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, most likely
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
