                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with persistent fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is mild
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may represent scarring or small
 pleural effusion.  There is rightward shift of the anterior junction line
 suggestive of bullae in the left upper lobe.  Otherwise, lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Probable left upper lobe bullae.
 3.  Left costophrenic angle blunting which may represent scarring or small
 pleural effusion.
 
 If symptoms persist, repeat conventional chest radiography supplemented by
 oblique views may be obtained in several weeks.
