                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of congestive heart failure. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable cardiomegaly. 
 New consolidation in the upper lobes and right lower lobe is most likely
 pneumonia.  There is also retrocardiac opacity which could represent dependent
 atelectasis versus additional site of consolidation.  Trace effusions cannot
 be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia. Under appropriate clinical circumstances
 peripheral consolidation can be seen with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
