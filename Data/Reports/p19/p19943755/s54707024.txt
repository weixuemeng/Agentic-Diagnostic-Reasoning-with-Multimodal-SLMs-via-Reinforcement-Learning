                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pleural effusion, status post PleurX, question
 reaccumulation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The catheter overlies the base of the right lung. No ptx detected.  A small
 effusion is present.  This appears slightly larger than on ___ at 2:49
 a.m. even accounting for slight differences in positioning.  There is also a
 stable, small left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation at
 both bases.    Suspect background COPD.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent, but stable. Tapered appearance of both hila suggests pulmonary
 hypertension.  There is upper zone redistribution.  I doubt overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 probably slightly worse compared with one day earlier.  
 
 2) Previously described right apical pneumothorax is not appreciated on the
 current examination.
