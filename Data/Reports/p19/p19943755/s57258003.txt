                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion has substantially increased.  The effusion now occupies
 approximately half of the right hemithorax.  The effusion leads to
 considerable basal atelectasis.  The pre-existing small opacity at the basis
 of the right upper lobe is no longer visible.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, unchanged appearance of the normal
 left hemithorax, the left heart border and the left pectoral pacemaker.
