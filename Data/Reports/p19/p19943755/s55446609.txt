 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left axillary dual-lead pacemaker is again seen with tips in

 the current examination.  The right pleural effusion appears to have
 increased, although this may also be partly due to change in patient
 positioning.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in left pleural effusion and slight increase in right
 pleural effusion.
