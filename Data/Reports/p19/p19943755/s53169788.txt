 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer with concern for
 effusions/pneumonia.  // Pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a right pleural catheter
 remains in place with slight increase in size of a moderate right pleural
 effusion which contains intrafissural loculated components.  Small left
 pleural effusion has also apparently slightly increased in the interval. 
 Marked enlargement of cardiac silhouette is accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Nonspecific bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
