                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left-sided
 dual-lead pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  There are bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left, moderate on the right and small on the left, with
 overlying atelectasis.  There is either fluid tracking in the minor fissure
 versus possibly fissural thickening.  Bibasilar opacity most likely represents
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis but underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  There is mild left base atelectasis.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable and stable.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  Right basal opacity likely represents combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
