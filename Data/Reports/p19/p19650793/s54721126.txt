 Lung volumes are lower on the current exam with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  There is mild superimposed pulmonary edema.  More
 discrete opacities in the right mid to lower lung as well as in the
 retrocardiac region are now seen.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is grossly
 similar given lower lung volumes.  Degenerative changes noted at the
 shoulders.  Old right lateral rib fractures are seen.  Surgical clips seen in
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities in the retrocardiac region and right mid to lower lung which could

 Superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiomegaly and mild
 pulmonary edema.
