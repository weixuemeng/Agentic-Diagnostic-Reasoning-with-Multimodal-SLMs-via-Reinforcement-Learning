                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been improvement in
 the pulmonary vascular status with little if any elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Some coarse interstitial markings raise the possibility of
 underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
