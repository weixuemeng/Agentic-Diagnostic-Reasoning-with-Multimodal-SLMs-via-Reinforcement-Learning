 PORTABLE CHEST on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is persistently enlarged and accompanied by mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral small pleural effusions, and adjacent
 basilar atelectasis.  As compared to the prior study, the right pleural
 effusion has apparently decreased in size, and both lung bases are slightly
 better aerated.
