                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged. Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study with
 patchy bibasilar airspace opacities noted. Attenuation of the pulmonary
 vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with underlying emphysema.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, worrisome for
 pneumonia.
