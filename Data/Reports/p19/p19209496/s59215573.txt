                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and fever with HIV.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, with
 increased lucency in the upper zones, compatible with COPD.  Mild
 dextroscoliosis is centered about the thoracic spine. Bibasilar opacities
 appear more prominent. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. However, slightly increased
 bibasilar density warrants further evaluation with CT if fevers persist or
 worsen.
