                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CVA  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Suboptimal comparison as no lateral view is obtained, however there is a
 retrocardiac opacity which may correlate with the opacity seen on the prior
 lateral view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  In the size
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A retrocardiac opacity may correlate with the abnormality seen on the prior
 radiograph's lateral view, and in the correct clinical context may reflect
 pneumonia.
