                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart
 size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  There is residual
 opacity in the left lower lobe, decreased in size since ___, when
 it was seen to correspond to a cavitary lesion.  There is a persistent vague
 opacity in the right upper lobe, seen on the previous chest CT, which may
 represent sequelae of prior infection or persistent inflammation.  There is
 new opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle, which may be atelectasis but
 could also represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 The osseous structures are normal.  There has been interval removal of a PICC.
 No radiopaque foreign bodies are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right cardiophrenic angle opacity, which may represent pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Persistent right upper lobe and improved left lower lobe opacities.
