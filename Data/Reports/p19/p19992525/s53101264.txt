                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a severe
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine with spinal stabilization hardware in
 place, unchanged from prior exam.  There is a band-like consolidation in the
 right lower lung which is new from prior exam and could represent pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting.  There is a trace right pleural effusion.  Left
 lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess but
 appears grossly stable.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Band-like opacity in the right lower lung could represent
 pneumonia.  Followup to resolution is advised.
