                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new CVL  // CVL placement?      CVL placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. 
 Diffuse hazy opacity over the right hemithorax with associated blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is likely secondary to a small to moderate-sized
 pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac and left lung base opacity persists, likely
 secondary to atelectasis and pleural fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Persistent retrocardiac and left
 lower lobe opacity likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 fluid.
