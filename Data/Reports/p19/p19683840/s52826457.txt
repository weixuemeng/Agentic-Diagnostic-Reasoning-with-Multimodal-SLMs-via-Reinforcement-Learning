                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The aorta remains
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  A moderate to large layering right pleural
 effusion and small left pleural effusion are present, with the right pleural
 effusion likely larger in size in the interval.  Lung volumes are low with
 patchy opacities the lung bases likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted with probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No large pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Right
 PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable interval increase in size of moderate to large layering right pleural
 effusion, unchanged small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
