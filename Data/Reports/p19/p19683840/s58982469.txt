                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new ETT  // ETT?      ETT?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest.  .
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior chest radiograph, there has been interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube, which terminates proximal to the carina.  An orogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip terminates within the stomach.  The
 cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess.  Interval decreased opacity at the
 right lung base could be secondary to interval decrease in right pleural
 effusion versus positional changes.  There is increased opacity at the left
 lung base, which could be secondary to fluid and atelectasis.  A stent
 projects over the mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which appears to terminate just
 proximal to the carina.  Orogastric tube is in adequate position.
