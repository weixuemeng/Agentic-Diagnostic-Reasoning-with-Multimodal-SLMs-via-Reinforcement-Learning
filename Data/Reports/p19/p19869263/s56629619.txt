                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with wrist fracture, preop.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is anopacity projecting over the left lung base on the
 frontal and perhaps correlates with a vague opacity overly the spine on the
 lateral.  The lungs are otherwise clear of focal consolidation, noting
 bi-apical partially calcified scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic
 arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  Increased opacity projecting over the left lung
 base.  Repeat PA and lateral suggested to further characterize and if
 persists, CT scan may be necessary.
