                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Supine portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cardiac arrest  // Please assess for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 This exam is compromised by patient habitus and technique.  There is stable
 small bilateral pleural effusions, but mediastinum is wider probably due to
 vascular engorgement.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic and stable.  Moderate
 bilateral basal atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 Minimally improved interstitial opacities may be due to improved lung volumes
 and not necessarily improvement of moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 Intraaortic pump has not migrated, though 3 cm higher than conventional
 positioning.  Otherwise, the remaining monitoring and support lines are
 appropriate in positioning.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal improvement in lung volume.  Stable mild pulmonary edema. Progressive
 mediastinal widening probably due to vascular engorgement.
