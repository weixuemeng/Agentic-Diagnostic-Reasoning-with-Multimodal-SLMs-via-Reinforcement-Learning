                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:17, from outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The mid to lower lungs are relatively underpenetrated, presumed due to patient
 body habitus.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Mild
 prominence and indistinctness of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
