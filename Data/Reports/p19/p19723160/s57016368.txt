                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute on chronic HFpEF, CKD Stage III,
 DMII with dyspnea and elevated d-dimer.  // Question of pulmonary edema vs.
 pulmonary embolism.     Question of pulmonary edema vs. pulmonary embolism.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, scatter radiation related to the size
 of the patient again greatly obscures detail.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  There is some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure, but no evidence of frank edema.  No acute focal
 pneumonia, though in the appropriate clinical setting, consolidation would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral
 view.
