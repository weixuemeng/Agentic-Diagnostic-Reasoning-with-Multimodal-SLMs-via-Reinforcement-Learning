                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CTA and chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is slightly limited by underpenetrated technique. Heart size remains
 mildly to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous with mild atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 bilaterally is similar and suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection
 is not completely excluded. Right lung is grossly clear. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to underpenetration. Patchy retrocardiac opacity, possibly
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
