                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___: 
 
 Comparison with a prior study from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP, upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight improvement in lung aeration and technique compared with prior.  There
 is right upper lobe consolidation which could represent a small focus of
 pneumonia.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no overt CHF.  Aorta
 appears unfolded.  No large pleural effusion.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Focus of consolidation in the right upper lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.
