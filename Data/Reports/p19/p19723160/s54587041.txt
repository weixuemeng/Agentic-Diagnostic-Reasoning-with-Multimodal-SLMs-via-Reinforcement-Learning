                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by body habitus. Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar with enlargement of the hila bilaterally compatible with pulmonary
 arterial hypertension. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due
 to low lung volumes without pulmonary edema. Scarring within the right apex is
 unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
