  Underpenetrated study.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly with pulmonary
  vascular engorgement suggestive of mild CHF.  Band-like opacity in RUL may
  represent pneumonia.  PA and lateral CXR recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough with a history of asthma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The radiograph is underpenetrated,
 limiting evaluation.  There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with slightly
 increased right ventricular predominance compared to the prior examination. 
 There is more prominent pulmonary vascular engorgement compared to the prior
 study.  A region of band-like opacity in the right upper lobe obscures the
 right mediastinal contour.  The lung bases are difficult to evaluate due to
 limitations in technique, and an underlying effusion or consolidation cannot
 be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly, with more prominent right atrial
 dilation, accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement is concerning for
 congestive heart failure.
 2.  Possible right upper lobe pneumonia.  Evaluation with PA and lateral
 radiographs is recommended for more optimal evaluation.
