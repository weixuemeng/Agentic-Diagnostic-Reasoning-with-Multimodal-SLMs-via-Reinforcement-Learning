                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with anemia, sob, orthopnia  // pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Limited study due to underpenetration.  Lung volumes are low.  A right PICC is
 seen, with the distant portion not well visualized, though likely terminating
 in the lower SVC.  There is moderate central vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Platelike atelectasis is seen in the left mid lung.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, though somewhat
 exaggerated by technique.  There is calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate central vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
