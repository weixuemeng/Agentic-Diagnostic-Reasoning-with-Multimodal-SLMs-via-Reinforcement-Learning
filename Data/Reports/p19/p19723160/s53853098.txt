  1. Non resolving bandlike opacity in the right upper lobe may represent
  scarring from prior pneumonia but should be evaluated by non- urgent CT as
  neoplasm cannot be excluded.
  
  2. Mild prominence of the hila is unchanged suggesting benign etiology.  
  
  3. There is no evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma presenting with cough, shortness of breath, wheezing. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the next most recent radiograph of the chest the lungs are
 similarly expanded.  The bandlike opacity in the right upper lobe is not
 appreciably changed.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable without
 cardiomegaly.  The hila are mildly prominent but stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Flowing ossification along the anterior and lateral
 vertebral bodies is re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Non resolving bandlike opacity in the right upper lobe may represent
 scarring from prior pneumonia but should be evaluated by non-urgent CT as
 neoplasm cannot be excluded given nonresolution. 
 
 2. Mild prominence of the hila is unchanged suggesting benign etiology though
 this can be assessed also at time of chest CT.
 
 3. No evidence of pneumonia.
