                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weight gain, chf hx  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is somewhat underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  This makes
 evaluation of the lung fields suboptimal although no definite new focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is is no large pleural effusion although trace
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  A right sided PICC courses into the
 SVC, distal termination site is not well seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There is prominence of the hila which may be due to
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.
