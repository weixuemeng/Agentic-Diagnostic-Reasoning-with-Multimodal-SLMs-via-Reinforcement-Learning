                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with DOE and elevate D-dimer  // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___ as well as a prior CT of the
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is a stable appearance of
 the right upper lobe band like opacity compatible with scarring. The heart is
 mildly enlarged. Hilar prominence is stable and likely represents prominent
 hilar vascular structures as better assessed on prior CT. Retrocardiac streaky
 opacity is present on the lateral projection which raises potential concern
 for atelectasis versus pneumonia though no correlate opacity is present on the
 frontal view.
 No large effusion or pneumothorax is present. Imaged bony structures appear
 intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly, stable prominence of the pulmonary hila, stable streaky
 right upper lobe opacity. Retrocardiac opacity seen on lateral view could
 represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
