                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chf/asthma with increased shortnes sof breath x
 1 week*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same last name!  // r/o
 cario/pulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The exam is suboptimal due to overlying soft tissue and the chest is
 relatively underpenetrated.  Given this, the cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.  Prominence of the hila is re- demonstrated,
 with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  No definite focal consolidation is seen although this would be
 difficult to exclude particularly at the lung bases and the hilar regions.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal due to overlying soft tissue and underpenetration, however, cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Re- demonstrated prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.
