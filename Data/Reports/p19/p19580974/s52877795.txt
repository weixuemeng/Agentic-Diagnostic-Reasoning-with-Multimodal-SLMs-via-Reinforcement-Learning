                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, AMS, hypoxia  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted as well as surgical clips projecting over the
 upper abdomen.  Evaluation is somewhat limited due to subtle motion artifact
 on the single view provided.  Allowing for this, volumes are low though the
 imaged portions of the lungs appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam without signs of overt abnormality.  Motion artifact limits
 evaluation.
