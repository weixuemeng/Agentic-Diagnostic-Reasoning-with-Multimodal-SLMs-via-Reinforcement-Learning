                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are decreased lung volumes compared
 to the prior study.  The heart size is normal with a mild left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours otherwise are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 There is mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with minimal streaky
 opacity in the lung bases compatible with atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
