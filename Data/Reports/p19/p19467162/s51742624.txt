                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Low lung volumes cause
 mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures, though no overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly noted.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection however is not completely excluded.
