                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers and crackles on exam.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recent on the chest CT of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Medial right lung base and retrocardiac opacities are new and
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  A spiculated nodule in the left upper
 lobe is similar to prior.  Other known nodules were better evaluated on prior
 CT.  Indistinct appearance of the left hemidiaphragm suggests the presence of
 a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Symmetric right base and retrocardiac opacities may represent either
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
