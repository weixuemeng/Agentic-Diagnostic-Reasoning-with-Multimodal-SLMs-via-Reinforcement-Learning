                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous
 changes again noted.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases without
 substantial interval change, likely atelectasis, without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Mild to moderate
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous radiograph with continued
 emphysema and patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, without focal
 consolidation.
