                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F PMHx atrial fibrillation on xarelto, tachy-brady syndrome s/p
 PPM, CKD, HTN, COPD, who presented with productive cough and dyspnea now with
 worsening dyspnea at rest.  // ?pulmonary edema, other acute intrapulmonary
 process    ?pulmonary edema, other acute intrapulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears
 increased, though some of this may merely be a manifestation of the supine AP
 portable technique.  Opacification at the bases suggests small bilateral
 effusions with compressive atelectasis.
 No definite acute focal pneumonia.  However there is some asymmetry of
 opacification at the right base which, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 could be consistent with developing consolidation.
