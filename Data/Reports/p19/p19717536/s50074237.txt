                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads in unchanged positions in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar compared
 to the prior radiograph.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated compatible with underlying emphysema.  Prominence of the hilar
 contours unchanged with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, as seen
 previously.  Patchy airspace opacities are noted in the left lung base, more
 pronounced than on the previous study, and may reflect early infection.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy airspace opacities in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
