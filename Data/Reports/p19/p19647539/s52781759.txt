                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent sputum production.  Evaluate for
 active or latent TB or focal consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. 
 A subtle area of peribronchial opacification projecting over the cardiac apex
 is seen only on the lateral view.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A subtle area of opacification projects over the cardiac apex only on the
 lateral view.  This radiograph is otherwise normal, as we would hesitate to
 call this area pneumonia without old films to suggest it is a new finding.
