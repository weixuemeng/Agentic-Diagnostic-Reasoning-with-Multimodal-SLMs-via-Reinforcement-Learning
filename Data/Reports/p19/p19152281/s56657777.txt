                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Episode of hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe with associated
 bronchiectasis.  There is a small amount of fluid /thickening along the minor
 fissure.  As also seen on the prior study, there is right upper lobe
 atelectasis with associated bronchiectasis.  Lung volumes are lower as
 compared to the prior study, but otherwise, there appears no significant
 interval change.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given
 differences in inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change given differences in lung volumes.
