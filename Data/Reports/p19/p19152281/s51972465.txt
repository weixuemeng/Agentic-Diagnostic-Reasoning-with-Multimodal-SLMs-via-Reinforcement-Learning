                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___ as well as
 prior chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe with associated
 bronchiectasis has slightly progressed in the interval.  Lower lobe bronchial
 wall thickening, best visualized on the lateral radiograph has slightly
 progressed in the interval.  Peripheral right lower lobe and left upper lobe
 scarring are unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are
 no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval slight worsening of partial right upper lobe atelectasis
 with associated bronchiectasis, and apparent progression in bilateral lower
 lobe bronchial wall thickening.  These findings may be due to the patient's
 history of MAC infection.  Consider followup chest CT for more accurate
 comparison to previous outside CT of ___.
