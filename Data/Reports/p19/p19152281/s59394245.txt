                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with bronchiectasis and
 cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 multiple prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal in size, tortuous but unchanged
 aorta.  Right middle lobe area of atelectasis is redemonstrated.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No new focal
 abnormalities to suggest interval development of consolidations demonstrated. 
 Cluster of nodules in the left lower lung most likely corresponds to pulmonary
 nodules demonstrated on ___ and ___ radiograph. 
 Since the lingular nodule appears to be relatively enlarged as compared to
 multiple additional pulmonary nodules, followup at least with chest x-ray in
 three months for assessment of stability is required.
