                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with previous pneumonia, improving symptoms, now
 presenting with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Previously noted
 partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe with associated bronchiectasis and
 thickening of the minor fissure are relatively unchanged.  There may be subtle
 slight increase in opacity projecting over the right lower lung field. No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion seen.  Small right pleural effusion
 seen on subsequent abdominopelvic CT was better appreciated on that study. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
