                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTs dated ___ and ___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung base is densely opacified by a combination of pleural effusion
 and lower lobe collapse.  Heterogeneous density in the right lower hemithorax
 is also likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. A large area
 of vaguely increased radiodensity in the right upper lobe is probably
 consolidation. Heart size is top-normal. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left pleural effusion and lower lobe collapse. Smaller right pleural
 effusion and less severe atelectasis.
 2. Right upper pneumonia.
