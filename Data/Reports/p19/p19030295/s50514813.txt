                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hemoptysis   mediastinal LAD, s/p EBUS
 biopsies on right, s/p stent placement in R bronch intermedius  // PTX?   eval
 aeration s/p stent
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the right paratracheal opacity is more readily
 visible.  I suspect this is due to differences in technique, but slight
 interval enlargement cannot be entirely excluded.  The trachea in this area
 does not appear narrowed.
 
 Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette, including the hilar adenopathy,
 is unchanged.  No CHF or focal consolidation.  Mild patchy opacity in the
 right cardiophrenic region is slightly improved.  Platelike atelectasis in the
 right mid zone is new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Right paratracheal opacity is more prominent --___ due to technique or
 interval slight enlargement.
 3. New right midzone platelike atelectasis.  Slight interval improvement in
 right cardiophrenic opacity, likely also atelectasis .
