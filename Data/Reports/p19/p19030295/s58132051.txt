                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p balloon dilation and rigid, please r/o PTX 
 // s/p Rigid bronc
 
 COMPARISON:
 Outside chest radiograph and CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse are again demonstrated
 and likely postobstructive in this patient with known right juxta hilar mass
 and obstructed distal airway stent on recent CT.  Known mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is seen to better detail on recent CT.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax following recent bronchoscopy procedure.  New patchy left
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to localized atelectasis or aspiration in the
 post procedural setting.
