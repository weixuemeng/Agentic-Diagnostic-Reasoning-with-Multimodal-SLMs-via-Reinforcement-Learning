                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with anterior mediastinal
 mass after left VATS biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Current examination demonstrates no definitive evidence of pneumothorax,
 previously seen on the left.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged including
 bulging of the left mediastinum due to known anterior mediastinal mass.  Lungs
 are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated.
