 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph pre
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cirrhosis with SOB. Assess for pneumonia effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hypoinflated lungs with perihilar interstitial prominence consistent with
 vascular crowding. No pleural effusion pneumothorax. Prominence of the heart
 is likely related to low lung volume.  New left lower lobe and retrocardiac
 opacity is noted. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable and upper abdomen is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New left lower lobe and retrocardiac opacities most consistent with
 atelectasis however superinfection cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is
 recommended.
 2.  Hypoinflated lungs.
