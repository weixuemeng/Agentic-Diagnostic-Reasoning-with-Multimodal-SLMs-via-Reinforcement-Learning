                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, orthopnea, left -flank discomfort
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour
 is unchanged.  There has been interval increase in size of the pleural
 effusion on the right, now moderate, with associated right basilar opacity
 likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Patchy left basilar opacity may
 also reflect atelectasis.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Increased size of right pleural effusion, now moderate with
 bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
