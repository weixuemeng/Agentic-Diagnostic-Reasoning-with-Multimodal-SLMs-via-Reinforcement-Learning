                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, concern for hepatic
 encephalitis  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  A
 small right pleural effusion is decreased in size compared to the previous
 study.  Patchy opacity within the right lower lobe may reflect atelectasis,
 but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No additional
 focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small right pleural effusion,
 decreased in size compared to the prior exam, and associated right basilar
 atelectasis.  Please note that infection in the right lung base cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
