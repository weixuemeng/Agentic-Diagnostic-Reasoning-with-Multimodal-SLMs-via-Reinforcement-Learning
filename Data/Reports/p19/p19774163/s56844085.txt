                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate size right pleural effusion is new in the interval with associated
 right basilar opacity, likely compressive atelectasis though infection cannot
 be excluded.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the
 pleural effusion that appears at least mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours remain unchanged with no pulmonary edema noted. The left lung
 is clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New moderate size right pleural effusion with right basilar opacity likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
