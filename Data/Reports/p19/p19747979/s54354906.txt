                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube. Assess endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. 02:25.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube
 1.9 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position.
 
 Limited evaluation due to patient rotation. The lungs are hypoinflated with
 bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Multiple posterior right rib deformities are
 similar in appearance to previous examination and in the absence of trauma are
 consistent with healed rib fractures. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Heart is incompletely evaluated due to patient positioning. Mediastinal
 contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Chronic right rib deformity from multiple healed rib fractures.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
