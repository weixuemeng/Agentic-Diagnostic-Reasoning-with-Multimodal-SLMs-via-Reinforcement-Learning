  1. Right lower lobe heterogeneous opacity is most consistent with atelectasis
  however pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 2.
  Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 3. Multiple
  posterior healed rib fractures with severe rib cage deformity. Limited
  evaluation for acute fractures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hemoptysis. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are slightly hypoinflated with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable. Calcification of aortic arch is present.
 
 Evidence of multiple posterior right healed rib fractures with severe rib cage
 deformity. Previous right clavicular fracture with intact hardware. No
 evidence of hardware loosening.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar opacities which favor atelectasis
 although differential diagnosis includes aspiration and infectious pneumonia.
 Considering clinical suspicion for infection, followup PA and lateral chest
 radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate the lung bases
 3.  Multiple posterior healed rib fractures with severe rib cage deformity.
 Limited evaluation for acute fractures.
