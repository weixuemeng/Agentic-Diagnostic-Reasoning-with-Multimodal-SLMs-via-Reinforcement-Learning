 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trachea has been extubated.  Lung volumes have improved.  Residual opacity at
 the base the left lung is probably atelectasis, although a very small
 pneumonia is not excluded.  There is no pulmonary edema or large region of
 atelectasis to explain hypoxia.  This examination neither suggests nor
 excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  Healed severe right rib
 fractures.
