 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ back to

 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Additionally, there is a left PICC and

 taken on the same day ___ at 02:34, there is worsening of the
 bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities with airspace features.  The
 upper lung fields are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions, not markedly changed from the previous
 radiograph.  The sternal cerclage wires and aortic calcification is unchanged.
