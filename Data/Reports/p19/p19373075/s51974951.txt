                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, history of endocarditis.  Assess for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval removal
 of right-sided PICC line.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Faint opacity projecting over the spine in the lateral view
 without definite correlate on the frontal view is stable since ___
 and is most likely due to atelectasis, though an early pneumonia is a less
 likely possibility.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint opacity projecting over the spine on lateral view is
 unchanged since ___ and is most consistent with atelectasis, though
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
