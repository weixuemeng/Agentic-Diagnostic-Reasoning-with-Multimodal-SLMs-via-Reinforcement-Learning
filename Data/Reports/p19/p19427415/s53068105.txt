                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question TIA, CHF, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  The heart is not enlarged. 
 Slight prominence of the pulmonary hila, with a tapered appearance, could
 reflect the presence of pulmonary hypertension.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.
 No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  At the edge of these
 images, scattered calcification overlying both carotid arteries is noted.  
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.
