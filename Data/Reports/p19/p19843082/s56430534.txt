                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis and multifocal pneumonia, with
 worsening respiratory status.  // Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right basal parenchymal opacity,
 potentially combined to a small effusion, has substantially improved.  The
 right lung bases is now better ventilated.  However, the mixed vascular and
 interstitial diffuse opacity in both the left and the right lung persist,
 likely indicating a combination of multifocal pneumonia and interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis is
 unchanged.
