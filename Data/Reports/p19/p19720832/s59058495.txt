 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening interstitial lung process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly decreased, and given this, there is an
 unchanged appearance to a basilar predominant edema and interstitial opacity
 superimposed upon emphysema, without significant pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged, mediastinal
 contours are unchanged without evidence of central venous engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Given slight decrease in lung volumes, basilar prominent
 pulmonary edema and interstitial opacity is unchanged from ___. 
 Differential diagnosis is unchanged including atypical infection, acute
 interstitial pneumonitis, and is unlikely to be cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
