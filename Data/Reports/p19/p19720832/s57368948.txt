                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxemia.  History of recent stroke.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic arch.  The heart is at the
 upper limits of normal size.  There is a slightly heterogeneous but
 predominantly diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality which appears new
 since the prior examination and could be seen with interstitial pulmonary
 edema, mild to moderate in severity, but atypical infection could also be
 considered.  There is, in particular, peripheral opacity layering immediately
 above the minor fissure and opacification of the lateral left upper lobe is
 also more prominent than elsewhere.  More confluent infrahilar opacity on the
 lateral view is difficult to place on the frontal view, although likely within
 the left lower lobe.  Fissures are slightly thickened including both major and
 minor fissure.  However, there is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature is noted along the thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New substantial interstitial abnormality, somewhat heterogeneous.
 Correlation with clinical presentation is recommended.  This could be seen
 with interstitial pulmonary edema but potentially atypical pneumonia could be
 considered.
