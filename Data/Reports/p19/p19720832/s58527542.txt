                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 increase in interstitial pulmonary edema, now moderate.  There is no large
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged, and
 normal in size.  The mediastinal contours remain normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in now moderate pulmonary edema, though the heart size
 remains normal.  Differential diagnosis includes atypical infection, drug
 reaction, or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This might also represent an acute
 exacerbation of chronic interstitial lung disease as acute interstital
 pneumonitis.
