                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Positional hypoxia, to assess for progression of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is better inspiration,
 but little overall change in the relatively diffuse predominantly interstitial
 bilateral abnormality.  There is also suggestion of a more coalescent area of
 opacity at the right base laterally.  In view of the normal heart size,
 pneumonia would be strongly suggested.
