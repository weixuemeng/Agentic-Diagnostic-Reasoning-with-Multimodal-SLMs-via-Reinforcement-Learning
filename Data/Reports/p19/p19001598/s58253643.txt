                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with antrectomy  // NGT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Fractured
 inferior sternotomy wire again noted.
 
 The left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic sulcus are now better defined,
 suggesting interval improvement in the the left effusion and left lower lobe
 collapse/consolidation.  Some residual left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
 
 On the right, there has been slight improvement in the right cardiophrenic
 opacity.  The small right effusion is again seen, similar to prior.
 
 Left-greater-than-right apical pleural thickening again noted.  Fractures of
 the  mid/lower posterior right ribs again noted, presumably old.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 NG tube, pacemaker, and presumed epidural catheter again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Partial interval improvement in collapse/consolidation at the left base and in
 the right cardiophrenic opacity.  Marked improvement in left pleural effusion.
 
 NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film.  The sideport is not well
 delineated, but appears to lie immediately beyond the GE junction.
