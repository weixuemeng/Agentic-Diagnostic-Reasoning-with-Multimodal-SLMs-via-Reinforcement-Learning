                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with posop w/ fever  // eval PNA vs atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  A left-sided pacemaker present, with lead tips over
 right atrium right ventricle.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath
 diaphragm, off film.  Surgical ___ are noted over the upper abdomen in the
 midline.  Linear density overlying the left lung could represent an epidural
 catheter, best correlated clinically.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Note is made that the lower most
 sternotomy wire is fractured.  There is probable mild cardiomegaly.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density with a probable small left effusion and partial
 obscuration the left hemidiaphragm.  There is minimal atelectasis in the right
 cardiophrenic region.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There is pleural
 parenchymal thickening/scarring at the left lung apex.  The right first rib
 may be truncated, but is unchanged.  Aside from right base atelectasis, the
 right lung is grossly clear.  No gross right effusion, though minimal pleural
 fluid could be present on the right.  Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD. 
 Note made of old rib fractures seen in lower right chest, similar to ___.
 
 Compared to ___ the heart size is larger.  Left effusion and left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is new and right cardiophrenic
 atelectasis is more pronounced.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation of the left base.
 2. Atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region.
 3. Cardiac silhouette larger compared with ___.
 4. Clinical correlation is required for full assessment.
 5. Fractured inferior sternotomy wire, unchanged compared with ___.
