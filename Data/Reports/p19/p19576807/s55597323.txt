                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MCA infarct, now intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 is somewhat difficult to assess, though it appears to be about 4.2 cm above
 the carina.  There is a nasogastric tube in place, though the bottom of the
 image is at the region of the cardioesophageal junction and the tube cannot be
 followed below this.
 
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is
 at the upper limits of normal in size.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels suggests some element of pulmonary venous congestion.  No definite
 pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.
