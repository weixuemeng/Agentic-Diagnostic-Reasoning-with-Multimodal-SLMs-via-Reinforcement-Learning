 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.4 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach,
 with tip projecting off the inferior borders of the film.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A deep left
 sulcus is noted concerning for a pneumothorax.  No mediastinal shift is
 evident. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
