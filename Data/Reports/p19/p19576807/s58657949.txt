                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient remote MCA infarct and new
 internal capsule and thalamic infarct and currently tachypnea.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to ___ obtained 3:42 a.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is in its previous location, 6 cm above the carina.  The NG
 tube tip passes below the diaphragm.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly
 stable including mild cardiomegaly.  Mild vascular engorgement is noted, but
 no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 As compared to the prior study, the only substantial change is increase in
 vascular engorgement that might represent volume overload resulting in
 tachypnea.
