 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:19 PM
  Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema.  No large pleural
  effusions.   Persistent left basilar consolidation may reflect atelectasis -
  though pneumonia or aspiration could be considered in the appropriate clinical
  circumstance.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.  ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:49 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD, end-stage renal disease and shortness of breath.  Question
 volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Leftward mediastinal shift suggests volume loss in the left lung, and
 therefore heterogeneous opacification in the infrahilar left lower lobe could
 be atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion may be present.  Lateral view
 would be very helpful in distinguishing among the possibilities.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lung is fully expanded and probably clear, but
 there is a suggestion of a ___-mm nodule projecting over the second anterior
 rib partially obscured by tubing.  When conventional radiographs are obtained
 this area can be reexamined.
