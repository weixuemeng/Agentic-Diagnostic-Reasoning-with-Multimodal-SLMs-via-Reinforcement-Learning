                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary infiltrates
 after bronchoscopy and biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 After the biopsy there is new opacity in the left upper lobe most likely
 representing post-biopsy hemorrhage.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged as well as there is no substantial change in multifocal opacities
 although the impression is that there is slight decrease in their extent. 
 Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is still present.
