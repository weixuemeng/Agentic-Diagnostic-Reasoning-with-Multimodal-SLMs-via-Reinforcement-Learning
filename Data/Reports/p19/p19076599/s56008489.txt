                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Back pain and chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine frontal, upright AP, and upright lateral images of the chest were
 acquired. 
 
 Exam is very limited due to portable technique and patient body habitus.  The
 lung volumes are very low.  With associated bronchovascular crowding.  Supine
 positioning is responsible for substantial amount of vascular engorgement
 compared to prior exam in ___ when vessels were normal.  This
 engorgement, along with patient body habitus, makes it difficult to tell if
 there is heart failure or not.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to patient body habitus and portable technique.  Supine
 positioning is responsible for substantial amount of vascular engorgement
 compared to prior exam in ___ when vessels were normal.  This
 engorgement, along with patient body habitus, makes it difficult to tell if
