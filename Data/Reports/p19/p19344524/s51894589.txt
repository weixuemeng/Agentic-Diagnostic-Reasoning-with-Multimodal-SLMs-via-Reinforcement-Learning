                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE AP CHEST:
 
 The patient has been intubated, and an orogastric tube has been removed.  A
 right IJ line extending to the low SVC, bilateral chest tubes, and a
 mediastinal drain are in unchanged position.  There is increased veiled
 opacity over the lung bases bilaterally, implying new effusions, moderate in
 size.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild vascular congestion is unchanged. 
 There is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval extubation and removal of orogastric tube.  Chest tubes
 and mediastinal drains remain in stable position.  There are new moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions and associated basilar atelectasis.
