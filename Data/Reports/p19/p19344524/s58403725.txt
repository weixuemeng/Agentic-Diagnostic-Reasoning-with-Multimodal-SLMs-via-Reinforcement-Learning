                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male postop day #4 status post CABG.  Evaluate for
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A right IJ line has been removed.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 surgical clips and sternotomy wires are in unchanged alignment.  There is no
 focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions which persist.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is also noted.  However,
 overall aeration of the lungs is improved compared to two days prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration with overall increased lung volumes, though
 some basal atelectasis and small bilateral effusions persist.
