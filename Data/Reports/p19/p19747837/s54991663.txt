 Otherwise, lungs are clear. No large pneumothorax. No signs of pulmonary
 edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal residual pleural thickening versus tiny effusion at the right lung
 base.  Right CP angle partially excluded.
