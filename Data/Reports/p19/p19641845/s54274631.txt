                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Productive cough and fall.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study on ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous as before.  There is no
 pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  If any there are tiny bilateral
 effusions.  Increase of the AP diameter of the chest suggests COPD.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine and S-shaped scoliosis. 
 Linear opacities in the lingula are unchanged likely scarring.
