                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and hemetemesis, altered mental status, evaluate for
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 3:43 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest.  Enteric tube ends just distal to
 the gastroesophageal junction with side port in the distal esophagus. 
 Compared to prior study, there are new bilateral basilar opacities which may
 represent aspiration given the increase in opacities over the short interval
 time.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, since radiographs done
 four hours prior, are concerning for aspiration. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2.  Enteric tube side port ends in the distal esophagus and should be
 advanced.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 9:34 a.m. on ___ by telephone at the time of
