                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two serial chest radiographs were performed.  The initial one
 demonstrates an orogastric tube with side port above the GE junction.  The
 second image demonstrates advancement into the stomach, which is moderately
 distended.  Endotracheal tube is in standard position on both radiographs. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are clear except
 for improving atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
