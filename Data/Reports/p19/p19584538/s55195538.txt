                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncopal event.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a left basilar opacity
 most consistent with atelectasis, though an underlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
