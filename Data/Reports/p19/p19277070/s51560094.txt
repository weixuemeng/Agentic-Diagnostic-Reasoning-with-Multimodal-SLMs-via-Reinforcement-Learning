 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:36 PM
  Bibasilar opacities are most consistent with atelectasis, but infection may be
  considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and mitral valve replacement appear intact.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVR, evaluate for acute process.  Elevated WBC and febrile.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  AP chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Sternotomy wires and a prosthetic valve are present.  The left hemidiaphragm
 is elevated, with patchy opacity at the left base, which appears both slightly
 better and slightly worse in some areas.  There is minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, consistent with new left effusion.  There is mild
 patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, which is new compared with
 the prior study.  Linear atelectasis or scarring in the left mid/upper zone is
 unchanged.  No CHF identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Patchy opacity in left lower lobe, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The possibility of an infectious infiltrate in this area
 cannot be excluded.  Minimal left pleural fluid is new.  
 
 2) Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region could also represent a
 developing infiltrate.
