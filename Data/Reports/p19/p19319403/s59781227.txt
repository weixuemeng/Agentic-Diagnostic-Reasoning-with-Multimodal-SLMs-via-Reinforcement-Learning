                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma and pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased hazy
 opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with pleural effusion.  The
 relative opacification at the left base suggests that the effusion on this
 side is less prominent.  Bibasilar compressive atelectasis is present.  Poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm behind the heart suggests volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no definite vascular
 congestion.
