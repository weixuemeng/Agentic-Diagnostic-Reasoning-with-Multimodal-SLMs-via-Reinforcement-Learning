                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with right eighth and ninth rib fractures from
 fall off the ladder, now has increased pain with breathing and needs oxygen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to a torso CT on ___:
 
 No pneumothorax or a new right pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes suggest
 splinting.  Left lung is clear.  A nodule at the base of the right lung on CT
 scan performed elsewhere ___, 3:49, 16 mm, deep in the right lung base,
 needs to be followed to make sure this was a transient artifact of trauma and
 not a clinically significant lung lesion.
