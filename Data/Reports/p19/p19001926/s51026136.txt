                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None (patient is listed as ___ Critical at the time of
 interpretation).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to mild patient rotation.  There is moderate to
 severe cardiomegaly.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.4 cm from the carina.
 Low lung volumes are noted with crowding of the pulmonary vascular structures,
 and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Air bronchograms with
 opacification in both lung bases may reflect areas of infection.  Patchy
 opacities are also noted within the right upper lung field as well as the left
 upper and mid lung fields, concerning for additional sites of infection or
 aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Prominent
 gaseous distention of the stomach is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 
 2. Consolidative opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of infection. 
 Additional patchy opacities within the left lung and right upper lung field
 are concerning for additional sites of infection or aspiration.
 
 3. Cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
