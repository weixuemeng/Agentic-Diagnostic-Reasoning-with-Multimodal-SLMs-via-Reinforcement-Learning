                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, CHF and
 pneumonia now with worsening respiratory distress, evaluate for worsening
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is relative lucency at the right upper lung, corresponding to a large
 bulla seen on prior chest CT.  Lower lung reticular opacities are consistent
 with clinical history/chest CT of pulmonary fibrosis.  A more confluent region
 of opacity in the right lower lung is new, raising the possibility of
 superimposed infection.  The heart and mediastinum are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known pulmonary fibrosis, however a more focal region of airspace opacity in
 the right lower lung could represent infection.
