                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild unfolding is noted along the
 thoracic aorta.  The right upper lung is relatively lucent with a paucity of
 bronchovascular markings, which is also true to a lesser degree of the left
 upper lobe, suggesting emphysema.  A nipple shadow projects over the right
 lower lung.  There is a striking moderate interstitial abnormality
 predominantly involving the the mid-to-lower lungs with peribronchial cuffing.
 Slight subpleural scarring is present at each lung apex.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present along the
 lower lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of emphysema including a widespread moderate
 interstitial abnormality.  The appearance is concerning for pulmonary edema in
 the appropriate clinical setting superimposed on background abnormal lung
 architecture, although a more chronic interstitial abnormality could also be
 considered; correlation with prior films, if available, would be helpful.
