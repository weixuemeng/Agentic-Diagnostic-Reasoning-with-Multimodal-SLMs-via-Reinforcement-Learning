                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral arm burning, assess for evidence of dissection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Kyphotic
 deformity of the thoracic spine slightly limits evaluation.  There is again
 noted to be mild reticular opacity within the lungs, which could represent a
 combination of bronchovascular crowding and overlying chronic disease, i.e.,
 emphysema.  No large effusion.  No signs of pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarsened reticular markings likely represent emphysema.
