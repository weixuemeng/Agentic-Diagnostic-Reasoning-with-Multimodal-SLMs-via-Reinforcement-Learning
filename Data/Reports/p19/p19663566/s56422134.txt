                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lightheadedness, assess for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low with kyphotic angulation of the T-spine, limiting evaluation through the
 lower lungs.  Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Subtle Kerley B lines likely indicate mild interstitial edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications along
 the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta noted.  Again seen is a mild
 compression deformity in the upper T-spine seen on the lateral view.  Bones
 are demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.
