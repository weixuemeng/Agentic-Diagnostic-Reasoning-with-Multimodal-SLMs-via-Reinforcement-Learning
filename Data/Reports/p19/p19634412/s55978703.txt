                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded. Increased bilateral interstitial
 opacities are present, with more consolidative processes in the right lung
 base partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm margin and the left upper
 lung. The right basilar opacities appear worsened than in the previous
 studies. Blunting of the right posterior costophrenic sulcus in the lateral
 view suggests a small right sided pleural effusion. There is no left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidative opacities in the right lung base and the upper left
 lung may represent infectious processes. If the clinical presentation is
 compatible with pneumonia, follow up is recommended ___ weeks after treatment
 to assess for resolution. However, if the presentation is not compatible with
 penumonia, further assessment with chest CT is recommended given progressive
 worsening of the right basilar and new left upper lung opacities.
