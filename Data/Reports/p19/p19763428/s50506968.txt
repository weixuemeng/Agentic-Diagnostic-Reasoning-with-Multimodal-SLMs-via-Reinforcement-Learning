                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and cardiogenic shock.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Comparison is made to the chest radiograph from ___.
 
 There has been interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter, with its tip in a
 relatively distal branch of the left pulmonary arterial system.  An
 intra-aortic balloon pump a is noted, with its tip projecting over the
 inferior aspect of the aortic arch. There is a left-sided pacemaker with
 associated right atrial and right ventricular leads. Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions are now layering given the patient's supine position,
 complicating comparison to the prior study from ___. There is at
 least mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no definite pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Swan-Ganz catheter ends within a branch of the left pulmonary artery.
 Repositioning should be considered.
 2. Borderline high positioning of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
 3. Bilateral layering moderate pleural effusions.
 4. Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by
 Dr. ___ at 09:47 via telephone on the day of the study, ___ min after
 discovery.
