                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fall from standing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema.  There are
 degenerative changes along the spine.  There are also degenerative changes at
 the right acromioclavicular joint.  No displaced fracture is identified. 
 Rounded calcific structures in the right upper to mid abdomen, partially
 imaged, may represent gallstones or fecal material.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite
 focal consolidation or displaced fracture is seen.
 
 Rounded calcifications in the right upper quadrant, at the inferior aspect of
 the images, most likely represent gallstones versus fecal material.
