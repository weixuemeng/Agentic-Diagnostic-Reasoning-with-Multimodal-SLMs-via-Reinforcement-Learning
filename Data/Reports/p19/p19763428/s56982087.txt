                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  There are
 significant perihilar and bibasilar opacities consistent with large bilateral
 pleural effusions as well as pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly
 suggest CHF.
