                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Stroke, pneumonia, leaning to the right, dizziness.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Heart is
 enlarged, allowing for technique.  The lung volumes are low with
 bronchovascular crowding obscuring the lung bases.  The upper lungs appear
 well aerated.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with cardiomegaly and lower lung bronchovascular
 opacities in the setting of low lung volumes.  If strong clinical concern for
 pneumonia, recommend repeat with more optimal inspiratory effort.
