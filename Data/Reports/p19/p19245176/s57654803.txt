                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemopneumothorax  // Interval change in
 hemopneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, multiple right rib
 fractures are again demonstrated with interval decrease in extent of right
 pleural fluid and or extrapleural hematoma adjacent to the fracture sites.  A
 small left pleural effusion is also noted.  Distended loops of bowel in the
 imaged upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph and
 could be more fully assessed by dedicated abdominal radiographs if warranted
 clinically.
