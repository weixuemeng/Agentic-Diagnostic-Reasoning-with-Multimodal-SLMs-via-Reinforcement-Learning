                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with low ejection fraction.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device, which is in an unchanged
 position.  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged but not well visualized. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There has been partial
 clearing of left basilar opacity that may have represented atelectasis but
 with persistent pleural effusions that are similar to perhaps minimally
 increased with suggestion of loculated components.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated opacities
 likely attributable to atelectasis, perhaps with minimal increase in pleural
 effusions.  Similar cardiomegaly.
