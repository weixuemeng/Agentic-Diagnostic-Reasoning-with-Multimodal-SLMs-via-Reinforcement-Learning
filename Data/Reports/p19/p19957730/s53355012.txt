                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and prior radiographs dating back
 to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The aortic contour and calcification pattern appears similar
 compared to prior studies.  Descending thoracic aortic contour also appears
 similar to prior studies, but is obscured inferiorly by adjacent lung and
 pleural abnormalities.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is
 accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution.  Small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are present as well as adjacent basilar
 atelectasis and/or consolidation, worse on the right than the left.  ICD
 pacing device remains in place with leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No portable chest radiographic findings to suggest aortic
 dissection, but the sensitivity of this study is low for detecting this
 diagnosis.  If there is clinical suspicion for acute aortic dissection, a CT
 angiogram would be recommended.
