                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CTA chest from ___, PET-CT from ___ and a prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia or
 worsening pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  A chest tube previously seen in
 the right lung base has been removed.  A pigtail catheter is partially imaged
 in the right upper abdomen.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted
 without significant change since the prior exam.  Upper lobe lucency is
 compatible with known emphysema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.  Interval removal of
 right basal chest tube.
