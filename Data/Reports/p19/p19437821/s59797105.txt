                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  There is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the left upper
 lobe that measures approximately 10 mm in diameter.  This opacity potentially
 represents a true lung nodule and should be investigated with either chest CT
 imaging or short-term standard PA and lateral chest radiographs in order to
 see whether it persists.  Discussed with ER resident; a chest CT is already
 planned.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, chronic, but now worsening.  Decreased breath sounds on
 the right.  Evaluate for infiltrate or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON: Recent prior abdominal films from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis at the right lung base; the effusion has substantially increased. 
 A small left pleural effusion is also present.  There is minimal left basilar
 atelectasis.   Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  There is no
 pneumothorax. A catheter overlies the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large right and small left pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Moderate right and mild left opacities, which are not specific but could
 be seen with associated compressive basilar atelectasis.
