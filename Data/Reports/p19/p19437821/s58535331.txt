 INDICATION:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, on chemotherapy, with
 subjective dyspnea and weakness, question reaccumulation of pleural fluid,
 cardiomegaly, evidence of volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  There is slight increase in a small
 right-sided pleural effusion but without evidence of overt pulmonary edema. 
 Faint opacification noted within the medial aspect of the right upper lobe as
 well as in the lateral aspect of the left upper lobe, correlate with patient's
 known pulmonary masses.  No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia
 identified.  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with tip terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction and a newly evident pigtail drain in the right upper
 abdominal quadrant. Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in small right pleural effusion.  No evidence
 for pulmonary edema.  Faint right upper lobe opacifications correspond with
 known masses.
