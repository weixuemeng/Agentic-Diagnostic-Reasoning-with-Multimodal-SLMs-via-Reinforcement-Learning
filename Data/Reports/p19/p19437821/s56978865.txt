                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CAD status post revascularization, remote bladder and
 colon cancer, now dyspnea with large right effusion, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:54 a.m., the right pleural effusion is smaller,
 though a moderate amount of right pleural fluid remains present.  A small
 curvilinear density at the right lung apex is noted, but the appearance is not
 typical for pneumothorax.  Attention to this area on followup films is
 recommended.  
 
 There is underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung base, with
 obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is minimal atelectasis at the
 left base and minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, unchanged. 
 There is borderline upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. 
 There are sternotomy wires and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. 
 Tubing overlies the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, ? within or outside
 of patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion, though
 small-to-moderate effusion persists, with underlying right base collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Doubt pneumothorax.  Please see comment.  
 2) No CHF.
