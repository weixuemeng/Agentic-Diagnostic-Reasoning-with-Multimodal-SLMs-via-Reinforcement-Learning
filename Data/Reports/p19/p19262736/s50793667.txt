                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia; evaluate for pulmonary edema,
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, earlier on the same day at
 1033h.  Limited reference is also made to the CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___ at 1318h.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity in the right lower lung with silhouetting of a portion of the right
 hemidiaphragm, right shift of the heart, and probable elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is most compatible with atelectasis, new from the prior exam. 
 The remaining right lung and left lung are essentially clear.  No edema or
 large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Incompletely
 imaged coarse calcifications projecting over the right upper abdomen are
 consistent with sequelae of prior granulomatous disease, imaged more
 completely on the recent CT abdomen and pelvis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of right lower lobe atelectasis, likely from aspiration
 and mucoid impaction of the airway when compared with prior imaging.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:05 PM, 1 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
