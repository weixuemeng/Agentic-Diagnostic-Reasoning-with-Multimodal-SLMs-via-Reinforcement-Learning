                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with worsening hypoxia.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal heart size.  Normal hilar contours.  Increased opacity at the right
 base with complete obscuration of the contours of both the right hemidiaphragm
 and right heart border and rightward mediastinal shaft reflect complete
 collapse of the right middle lobe and worsening of severe right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The left costophrenic sulcus is not imaged, but the remainder of
 the left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.  New, small region of consolidation
 in the right upper lobe close to the fissures could be early pneumonia, and,
 along with persistent atelectasis due to aspiration or uncleared bronchial
 secretions.  Minimal pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Complete collapse of the right middle lobe and interval worsening of
 substantial, right lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Possible early pneumonia, right upper lobe.  Consider aspiration or
 retained bronchial secretions.
 3.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
