                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to poor inspiratory effort and patient
 positioning.  Within this limitation, the lungs are underinflated with
 resultant bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased opacification at the
 right lung base which is likely due to atelectasis.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The right hilum appears more dense and
 rounded than the left but is difficult to assess due to low lung volumes and
 rightward rotation.  The cardiac silhouette is likely within normal limits for
 size allowing for low lung volumes.  The trachea is slightly deviated to the
 right by the aortic knob, which is ill-defined.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  There is
 generalized loss of height of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes. Right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis. 
 Asymmetry of right hilar structures may be due to accentuation of vessels by
 rotation and low volumes, but a mass cannot be excluded radiographically. 
 
 Followup PA and lateral chest radiographs are recommended with improved
 positioning and deeper inspiratory level when the patient's condition permits
 in order to re-evaluate the right hilus.
