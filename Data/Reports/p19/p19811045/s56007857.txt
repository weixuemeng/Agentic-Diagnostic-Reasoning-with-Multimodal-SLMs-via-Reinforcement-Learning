 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with necrotizing pancreatitis, extended stay in
 ICU with aggressive volume resuscitation.  Now mildly tachypenic on exam.  //
 extent of pulmonary edema, ? pneumonia     extent of pulmonary edema, ?
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ and enteric tubes have
 been removed.  Continued low lung volumes elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour.  Opacification at the right base most likely
 represents pleural fluid and atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with little if any elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.
