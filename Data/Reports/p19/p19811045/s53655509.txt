                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatitis, intubated  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A
 right IJ central line tip overlies the mid to distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes remain low, with the right hemidiaphragm  elevated with
 respect to the left.  Again seen is associated atelectasis.  No gross right
 effusion, though a small effusion might not be evident.  Hazy increased
 retrocardiac density, similar to the prior study, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Subtle air bronchograms in the
 retrocardiac region are more apparent on the current examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared with ___, no gross change is detected.
