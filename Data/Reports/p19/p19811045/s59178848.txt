                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of HTN, HLD, Alcoholism, OSA not on CPAP, who is
 transferred from OSH with acute pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. 
 // eval tubes/lines/edema/congestion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The  ET tube lies 3.8 cm above the carinal.  Right IJ line tip overlies distal
 SVC near SVC/RA junction.  An orogastric tube is present with tip extending
 beneath the diaphragm and off the film.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are quite low, with relative elevation the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 The degree of vascular plethora, which itself is likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes, may be slightly worse.  Otherwise, the appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and lungs is similar to the prior film.  
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is bibasilar atelectasis,
 likely also accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 
 No gross left effusion.  No obvious right effusion.  Allowing for low lung
 volumes, no focal consolidation identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vascular plethora may be slightly worse.  Otherwise, no significant change
 identified compared with 1 day earlier.
