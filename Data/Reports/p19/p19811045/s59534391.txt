  Very low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities greater on the right, likely
  reflecting atelectasis though superimposed aspiration or infection are
  possible.  ET tube and NG tube in expected position.  The findings were
  discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at
  11:06 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute pancreatitis with hypoxic respiratory failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 terminates within the stomach. There are low lung volumes, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding. A linear right basilar opacity is most compatible
 with atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
