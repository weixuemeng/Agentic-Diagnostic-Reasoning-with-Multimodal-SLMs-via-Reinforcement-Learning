                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG and feeding tube location.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 18:06 p.m.
 
 An NG tube is present.  The radiopaque tip is seen in two different locations.
 On one film, it overlies the lower mediastinum, and on the other -- labeled
 "2" -- it overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus.  These films are
 not labeled as to order.  
 
 Of note, there appear to be two tubes.  When tracking with the other, the tube
 without the radiopaque tip lies slightly proximal on the film where the tips
 are in the mediastinum and slightly distal on the film where the tips are in
 the gastric fundus.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette shows borderline cardiomegaly with an
 unfolded aorta, similar to prior.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion or
 overt CHF is seen.  Subtle linear opacities could be present.  No effusion is
 seen on either side.
 
 An electronic pack overlies much of the right mid zone of the right lung,
 leads from the pack appear to extend cephalad into the patient's neck beyond
 the edge of this film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two nasogastric-type tubes, one with a radiopaque tip.  On one
 film, the two tips overlie the lower mediastinum.  On the other film, the two
 tips overlie the gastric fundus.  The gastric fundus film is labeled as the
 second film.
