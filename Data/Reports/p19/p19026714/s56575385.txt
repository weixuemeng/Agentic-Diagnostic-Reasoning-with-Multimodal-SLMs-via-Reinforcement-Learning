                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right upper lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 The AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates progression of extensive right
 lung consolidations, in particular involving right upper lobes with most
 likely present lymphadenopathy in the right hilus.  There is also interval
 progression of interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on the infection. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
