                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracotomy and diaphragm plication with new
 desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There are bilateral pleural effusions left
 greater than right.  There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss.  There is
 vascular redistribution and patchy areas of increased alveolar infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Compared to the prior study.  The pulmonary status appears worse.   this may
 be due to pulmonary edema and lower lobe volume loss however an underlying
 infectious infiltrate in the lower lobes can't be excluded.
