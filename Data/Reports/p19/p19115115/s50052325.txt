                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size with a
 left ventricular prominence configuration.  Right central catheter again
 extends to the lower portion of the SVC.  No evidence of vascular congestion
 or pleural effusion.  The basilar opacifications seen previously have almost
 completely disappeared.
