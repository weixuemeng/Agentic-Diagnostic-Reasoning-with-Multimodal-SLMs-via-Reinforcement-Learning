                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with AML with fever and neutropenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTPA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Multiple
 previously visualized sub-4-mm nodules in the left lung are better delineated
 on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is no evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process. However, given the
 patient's history of AML, if clinical symptoms for a thoracic process are
 high, a dedicated Chest CT is recommended.
