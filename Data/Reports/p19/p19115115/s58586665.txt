                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and leukemia.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and generally clear.  On the frontal view, there is
 the suggestion of a nodule projecting through the apex of the right
 hemidiaphragm at the level of the sixth anterior rib.  This could be costal
 calcification entirely.  Routine oblique views should be sufficient to exclude
 a lung nodule.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces.  
 
 Findings were posted to the online record of critical radiology findings for
 direct notification of the referring physician.
