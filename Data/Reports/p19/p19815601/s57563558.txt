                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of sharp stabbing chest
 pain for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Increased
 right base opacity may be due to atelectasis although in the appropriate
 clinical setting, an early consolidation cannot be excluded.  Minimal left
 base atelectasis is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal right base opacity may represent atelectasis, although in
 the appropriate clinical setting an early consolidation would not be excluded.
