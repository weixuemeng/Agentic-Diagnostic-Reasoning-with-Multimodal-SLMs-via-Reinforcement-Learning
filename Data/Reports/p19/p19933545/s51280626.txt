                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Large hiatal hernia containing substantial portion of
 the stomach is redemonstrated and it might contribute to the presence of
 recurrent aspiration.  Lungs on the other hand are essentially clear except
 for minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  No focal consolidations to
 suggest infectious process or definitive aspiration are present.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  If clinically warranted, correlation with
 chest CT might be considered.
