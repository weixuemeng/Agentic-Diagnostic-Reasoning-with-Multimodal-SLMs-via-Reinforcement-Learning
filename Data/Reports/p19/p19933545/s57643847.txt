 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Has been relatively little change since ___.  One bowel loop projects above
 the anticipated level of the right hemidiaphragm to the right of the midline,
 another to the left of the midline is also close to the level of the
 esophageal hiatus, so I can't tell whether there is still herniated bowel in
 the chest. There has been a decrease in the volume or degree of distension of
 any such bowel compared to ___.  There is no normal stomach bubble below the
 diaphragm.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and substantial bibasilar atelectasis, left
 greater than right, are unchanged. The upper lungs are clear. Mild
 cardiomegaly is chronic. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but
 not focally aneurysmal. No pneumothorax.
