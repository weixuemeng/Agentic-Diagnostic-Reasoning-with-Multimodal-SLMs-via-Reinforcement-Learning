                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, fevers, question acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate a large
 retrocardiac opacity with an air-fluid level compatible with a large hiatal
 hernia, not significantly changed from prior.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  There is linear density at the
 left lung base which could represent a small amount of scarring or
 atelectasis.  Heart size appears grossly stable.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  Large hiatal hernia
 re-demonstrated.
