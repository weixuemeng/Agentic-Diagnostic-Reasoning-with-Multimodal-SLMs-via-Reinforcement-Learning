 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is now accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate edema. An air-filled
 structure in the right retrocardiac region has an appearance suggestive of a

 radiograph. New left lower lobe opacity could reflect aspiration, atelectasis
 or developing infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema is present in the left chest wall.
