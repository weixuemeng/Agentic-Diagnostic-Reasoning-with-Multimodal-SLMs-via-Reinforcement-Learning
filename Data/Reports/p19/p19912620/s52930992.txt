                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:17 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatitis.  Hypoxia after ERCP.  Evaluate
 possible fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating what is mild pulmonary edema and
 bibasilar atelectasis, which could in combination explain hypoxia.  Heart is
 poorly defined, but mildly enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Markedly
 elevated right hemidiaphragm could obscure right pleural effusion. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses.
