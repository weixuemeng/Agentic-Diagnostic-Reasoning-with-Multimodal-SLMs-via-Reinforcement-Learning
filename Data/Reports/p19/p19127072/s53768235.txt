                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mucus plugging, to assess for clearing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is continued opacification at the left base,
 most likely reflecting volume loss related to mucus plugging associated with
 pleural fluid.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly not be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
