                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe hospital acquired pneumonia.  Evaluate interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, within the mid
 trachea.  Enteric tube courses along the esophagus and terminates at the view,
 likely within the stomach.  A left PICC has been removed in the interim.  
 
 There has been improved aeration of the left lung base, with the left apparent
 hemidiaphragm being more conspicuous on this exam.  Multiple lucenies are also
 noted in this area.  A right hilar opacity is likely infectious in etiology. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion.  The right lung is clear and there is
 no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement, albeit persistent, left lower lobe pneumonia.
 Lucencies in this area may reflect developing cavitation versus newly aerated
 lung. This could be followed by radiography if the patient is clinically
 improving, otherwise, a chest CT would be needed for further evaluation.
