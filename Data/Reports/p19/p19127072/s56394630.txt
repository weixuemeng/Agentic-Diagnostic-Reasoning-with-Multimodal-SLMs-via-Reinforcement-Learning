                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, status post NG tube placement.  Evaluate
 location.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately ___ hours prior to this
 study as well as multiple recent chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is redemonstrated, ending 4.5 cm above the
 carina.  NG tube has its tip and sideport within the stomach.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are well inflated.  The right lung continues to be clear, while the left
 lung again shows a hazy opacity throughout the entire left base, which
 obscures the left hemidiaphragm but not the left heart border and does not
 cause hilar retraction.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant interval change in left lung base opacity. This may
 represent a consolidative process of the lung although other etiologies such
 as loculated pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Further assessment with CT
 could be pursued if clinically appropriate.
 2.  Endotracheal and NG tube in appropriate positions.
