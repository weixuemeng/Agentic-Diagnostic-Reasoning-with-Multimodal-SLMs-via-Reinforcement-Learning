                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess new ET tube.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 ET tube tip is only 2 cm above the carina, can be withdrawn 1 to 2 cm for more
 standard position.  Marked increased opacity in the left lower lobe is likely
 due to new large area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There are no other interval changes.
