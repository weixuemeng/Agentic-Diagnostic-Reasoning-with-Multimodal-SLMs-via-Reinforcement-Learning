                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post arrest*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular approach central
 venous catheter, with tip terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Enteric tube is present with distal tip not captured on
 the current study.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  A
 small left pleural effusion is likely.  Massive bilateral airspace opacities
 appear slightly worsened.  There has been interval development of a new left
 retrocardiac opacity with obliteration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse.  Healed fractures of right posterior ribs 5 and 6
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left internal jugular line with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Interval worsening of bilateral multifocal airspace opacities. 
 Differential is unchanged and includes severe pulmonary edema, ARDS, and
 severe multifocal infection.
 3.  Interval development of left lower lobe collapse with likely small left
 pleural effusion.
