 Bowel jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the right lower
 lobe pulmonary artery in the mid lung and should be pulled back approximately
 5-6 cm as previously recommended.  The intra-aortic balloon pump has its tip
 1.2 cm below the aortic knob.  The endotracheal tube and left internal jugular
 central line are unchanged in position.  The nasogastric tube now courses
 below the diaphragm with both the tip and side port seen over the proximal
 stomach.  There has been substantial interval improvement in the bilateral
 airspace opacities consistent with resolving but residual edema.  The pleural
 effusions also seen to have decreased in size.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  Old right-sided rib fractures again seen.
