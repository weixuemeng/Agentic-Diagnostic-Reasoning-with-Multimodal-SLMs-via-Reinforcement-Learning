                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with et tube.  Evaluate for tubes/lines.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT is not seen on this exam. Compared to the immediate prior exam, there has
 been a shift of bilateral interstitial opacities, most likely moderate
 pulmonary edema re-distributed, but not worsened.  Left internal jugular line
 terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein, unchanged from prior.  Heart size
 is top normal.  Pleural effusion is small, if any.  No pneumothorax is seen.  
 Left IJ line terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial opacities, likely due to redistribution of pulmonary
 edema.
