                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 PROCEDURE:
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Please note, low lung volumes limit evaluation.  There is subtle opacity at
 the left lung base which could represent atelectasis or bronchovascular
 crowding.  Please note however in the correct clinical setting and early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectasis, though an early
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting cannot be excluded.  
 
 NOTIFICATION:
