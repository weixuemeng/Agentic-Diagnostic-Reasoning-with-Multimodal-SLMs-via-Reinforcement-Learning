                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dental surgery on ___ status post oral intubation. 
 Patient now presents with cough.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly. Of unknown chronicicty is diffuse
 heterogeneous airspace opacification throughout both lungs nearly obscures
 interstitial abnormality and a handful of centimeter or smaller lung nodules,
 most pronounced in the right midlung. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Widening of the mediastinum is also of unknown
 duration and although it could be due to fat deposition and vascular
 engorgement could be due to adenopathy as well.
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Severe, diffuse heterogeneous airspace opacities throughout the lungs
 could be pneumonia/aspiration or alveolar hemorrhage. Many small lung nodules.
 
 
 2.  Mild interstitial thickening suggests a component of pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 4.  Possible mediastinal adenopathy.
 
 NOTE: As Dr ___ discussed with Dr ___ ___ the ___ staff, at 7:45am, A CT
 scan of the chest would be very helpful to confirm and characterize the
 abnormalities.
