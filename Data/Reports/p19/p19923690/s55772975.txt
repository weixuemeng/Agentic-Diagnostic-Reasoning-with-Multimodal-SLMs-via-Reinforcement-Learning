                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting with left lower quadrant
 pain, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP & LATERAL VIEW CHEST:  Lung volumes are low resulting in vascular crowding.
 Again noted is atelectasis of the left lung base which makes assessment of the
 heart size difficult.  There are calcifications within the aorta and a
 moderately sized hiatal hernia is noted.  Bibasilar opacities are most likely
 due to atelectasis, but consolidation due to infection/aspiration not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax or large consolidation
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities are most likely due to atelectasis, but
 consolidation due to infection/aspiration not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
