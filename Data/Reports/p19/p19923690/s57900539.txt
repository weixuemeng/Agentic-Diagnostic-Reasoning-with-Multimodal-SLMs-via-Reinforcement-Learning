 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Cardiomegaly appears unchanged with
 bilateral small pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.  There is hilar
 congestion.  Airspace opacities in the right mid to lower lung could reflect
 pneumonia.  No large pneumothorax.  Densely calcified tracheobronchial tree
 appears slightly kinked along the superior mediastinum though this is similar
 to the prior exam.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with hilar congestion, small bilateral effusions and probable
 pneumonia in the right mid to lower lung.
