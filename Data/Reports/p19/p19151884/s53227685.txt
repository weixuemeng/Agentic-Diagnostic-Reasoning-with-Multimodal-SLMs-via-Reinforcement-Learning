 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:06 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier today, there is
  redemonstration of multi loculated right pleural effusion.  Increasing
  aeration at the right lung base likely relates to recent thoracentesis and
  pleural fluid still remains at the right lung base.  No definite large
  pneumothorax is identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural effusion
 after attempted right thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly stable.  There is interval potential slight increase
 in the pleural effusion as compared to the prior study, giving the increase in
 the right upper lung opacity.  Rest of the loculations are unchanged.  No
 definitive pneumothorax is seen.
