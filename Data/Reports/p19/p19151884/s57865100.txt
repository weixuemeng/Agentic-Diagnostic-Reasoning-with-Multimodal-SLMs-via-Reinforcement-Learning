                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with 3 hepatic abscesses and emphysematous
 cholecystitis.  Evaluate interval change in pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a new lenticular opacithy
 suggestings a moderate to large right loculated pleural effusion along the
 lateral upper hemithorax and associated atelectatic changes.  There is
 improved aeration of the right lower lobe, though opacities suggesting
 atelectasis of portions of the right lower and middle lobes persists.   The
 left lung appears clear with no new consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  A right sided PICC is seen terminating at the low SVC as is a
 left-sided an central line.  Allowing for changes in patient position, the
 cardiomediastinal contour appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large new suspected loculated right-sided pleural effusion and
 associated atelectatic changes.
