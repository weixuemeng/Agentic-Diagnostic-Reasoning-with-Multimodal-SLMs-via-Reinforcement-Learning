                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:25 A.M.  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post removal of first of three chest
 tubes, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 545.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 325 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of one of three right-sided chest tubes with two
 remaining unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Lung volumes
 remain low with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. The pulmonary
 vasculature and interstitium appear slightly more ill defined on the current
 study raising the possibility of a component of mild interstitial edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in
 positioning and technique between studies.
