                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is hyperexpanded with mild leftward shift of the
 mediastinum.  There is consolidation of the peripheral left upper lung zone
 seen only on the PA view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart size is normal.  There is irregularity of the left hilar contour.  These
 findings would be compatible with a prior history of empyema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mediastinal shift and parenchymal irregularities are compatible
 with a prior history of empyema.  However, in the abscence of such a history,
 further evaluation with CT-Chest is recommended.
