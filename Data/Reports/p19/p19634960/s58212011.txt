                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer presenting with nausea, vomiting,
 shortness of breath and elevated white cell count.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___ and a recent
 chest CT was also performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the recent scout view, there is fairly little, if any,
 change.  Multiple circumscribed cavities and ill-defined opacities with
 thickening of the left lung apex appear very similar.  Discussed in the prior
 CT report the appearance is worrisome for a superimposed infectious process
 involving cavity formation, including a prominent cavity in the right upper
 lobe measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter with a small fluid level.  The
 right lung remains clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Opacification of the left aortopulmonary window is similar.  The heart is
 normal in size.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with the recent prior CT including multiple
 cavities in the left upper lobe worrisome for an infectious process including
 abscess formation.
