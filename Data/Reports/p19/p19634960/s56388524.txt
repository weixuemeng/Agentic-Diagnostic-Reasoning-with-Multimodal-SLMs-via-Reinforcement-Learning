                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:07
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Dobbhoff nasogastric tube, check
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 A portable upright AP view of the lower chest and upper abdomen is submitted
 dated ___ at 15:07.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube with the tip projecting over
 the proximal stomach.  Advancement may be prudent to minimize risk of
 aspiration as the metallic portion has its proximal end near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  There are persistent cystic and patchy opacities
 involving the left upper and mid lung that do not appear to be significantly
 changed when compared to prior study of ___.  No air-fluid levels are
 seen within the regions of cavitary change to suggest an acute infection.  The
 visualized right lung appears grossly clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
