                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
 prior radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular catheter ends at SVC.  Orogastric feeding tube is seen
 to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, however distal end is beyond
 the view of radiograph.  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Lower lung
 atelectasis and presumed small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Given the
 low lung volumes, assessment for mild or early pulmonary edema is limited.
