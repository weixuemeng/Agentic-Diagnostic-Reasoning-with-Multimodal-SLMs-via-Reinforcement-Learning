                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and influenza like symptoms for the past week now with
 vomiting, here to evaluate for pneumonia or intra-abdominal free air.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Abdominal radiograph
 dated ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased from the most recent prior
 study.  The lungs are otherwise symmetrically expanded and clear without focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  Mild biapical pleural thickening is noted.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size allowing for slightly decreased lung
 volumes.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The trachea is
 midline.  There is no evidence of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2. No free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
