 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube manipulation.  Evaluation for location.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube is at the level of the pylorus.  Nasoenteric
 tube is in place, the tip is out of the image but appears to be post-pyloric. 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed.  A new left central venous access line
 projects over the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  Minimal loss in
 lung transparency, potentially caused by fluid overload.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
