                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:15.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old preop for liver transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at  2:28.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal superior vena
 cava.  There is a feeding tube coursing below the stomach with the tip not
 identified.  Lung volumes remain low, and there is pulmonary vascular
 congestion likely reflecting a fluid replete state.  Linear opacity at the
 left base may represent an area of subsegmental atelectasis.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning
 and technique between studies.
