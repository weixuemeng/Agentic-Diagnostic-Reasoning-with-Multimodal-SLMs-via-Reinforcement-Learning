                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:25 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with volume overload and presumed pneumonia. 
 Evaluate any change in volume status.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Heterogenous opacification of the left lower lobe has been present since ___.  This could be pneumonia, but is more typical of atelectasis, and is
 accompanied, as expected by some volume of pleural effusion.  The patient is
 still intubated, tip of the ET tube, no less than 3 cm from the carina is
 acceptable with the chin down.  Nevertheless bronchial secretions may be
 responsible for persistent left lower lobe collapse.  Upper enteric feeding
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left subclavian line ends in
 the upper-to-mid SVC.  Small right pleural effusion is presumed.  There is no
 recent change in the appearance of the postoperative mediastinum, including
 moderate cardiomegaly and some vascular engorgement.
