                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Replacement ascending aorta hemiarch, now increased WBC, question
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  An enteric-type tube is present.  It
 may be a Dobbhoff tube.  If so, the radiopaque tip of the tube appears to
 overlie the EG junction/upper stomach.  A left subclavian central line is
 present, tip over proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The ET tube
 appears to have been removed.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density, but the exact location of the hemidiaphragm in relation
 to the cardiac silhouette is uncertain.  Possible minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Increased opacity in retrocardiac region, though this may represent a
 combination of a tortuous aorta, elevated hemidiaphragm and overlying soft
 tissues.  If there is clinical concern for a left base infiltrate, then a
 lateral view may help for further assessment.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate
 is identified.  
 
 2) Probable minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles.
