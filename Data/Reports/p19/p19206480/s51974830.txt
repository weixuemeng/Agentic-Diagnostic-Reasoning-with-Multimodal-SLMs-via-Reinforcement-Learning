 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, cough, and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are increased
 opacities in the lungs at the bases and most conspicuous in the right mid
 lung.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle on the right is compatible
 with a small effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Osseous structures demonstrate no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right effusion and hazy opacities in the lungs at the bases
 and the right mid lung could be due to atelectasis, infection, or aspiration
