                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with back pain and prior history of pneumonia. 
 Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated.  Retrocardiac patchy opacity seen on
 the lateral view, not substantiated on the frontal view is likely due to
 atelectasis, but developing consolidation is not entirely excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac patchy opacity seen on the
 lateral view, not substantiated on the frontal view is likely due to
 atelectasis/bronchovascular crowding, but developing consolidation is not
 entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
