 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion and
 TEE with new onset of neck pain.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  There is bi-apical pleural thickening.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD.  There is
 mild interstitial edema.  Minimal opacities in the left lower lungs are likely
 atelectases.  Wedge-shaped deformity of mid-thoracic vertebral body is again
 noted.
