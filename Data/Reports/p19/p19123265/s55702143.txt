                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 opacity projecting over the right lung apex at the level of the anterior right
 first rib likely relates to the first rib.  However, AP lordotic views would
 help in confirmation.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with flattening
 of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is
 mid-to-lower lung atelectasis bilaterally.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 is seen.  Minimal to mild interstitial edema is again seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflated lungs consistent with COPD.  Minimal interstitial edema,
 improved since prior.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Opacity projecting over the right lung apex at the level of the anterior
 right first rib may relate to the rib; however, suggest further
 evaluation/confirmation on AP lordotic view.
