  Increased right perihilar opacity with possible postsurgical changes. 
  Additional left midlung opacity.  In light of patient's history of metastatic

  recent scan was performed elsewhere for further evaluation. No definite acute
  cardiopulmonary process.

 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Fluoroscopic images from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size, and there is a right subclavian Port-A-Cath which
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Increased opacity seen in the right
 perihilar opacity with possible architectural distortion and suspected
 surgical chain sutures projecting over the mid lung.  There is also focal
 opacity projecting over the left midlung.  The lungs are clear of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild central
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right perihilar opacity with possible postsurgical changes.

 recent scan was performed elsewhere for further evaluation.  No definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
