                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of question perforation,
 rule out free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  No
 evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.  However, there is right
 base opacity that could be due to infection, aspiration, or metastatic
 disease.  There is also patchy left mid lung opacity, increased since the
 prior study.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Left-sided port is again
 seen, terminating in the right atrium.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is slight prominence of the
 ascending aorta, as seen on prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 2.  Patchy right base opacity and left mid lung opacification could be due to
 multifocal infection, aspiration or malignant process not excluded.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.  3. Prominence of the right mediastinum is similar
 compared to ___ scout image from CT, which may in part relate to
 prominent ascending aorta.  Continue follow-up.
