 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:12 PM
  Low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Faint opacity
  overlying the left lower lobe is likely representative of atelectasis;
  however, pneumonia must be excluded in the proper clinical setting. No acute
  cardiopulmonary process otherwise noted.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 Neutropenic fever, multiple myeloma status post auto transplant.
 
 Comparison is made with ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are lower lung volumes. 
 Increasing opacity in the left lower lobe could be due to atelectasis but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Central catheter tip is at the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There are multiple bilateral rib fractures as before.
