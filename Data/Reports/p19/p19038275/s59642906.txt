                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with shortness of breath with exertion and chest
 pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are markedly diminished, however, similar to prior
 exams.  There is mild interstitial prominence on the current study slightly
 accentuated over prior studies with prominence of bilateral hila.  No focal
 infiltrate is identified.  The cardiomediastinal configuration and morphology
 is stable.  There is subtle blunting of the right costophrenic angle, possibly
 indicating a small effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Body habitus limits
 evaluation of the osseous structures, but they are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  There is likely mild interstitial edema which
 has developed in the interval.  A tiny right pleural effusion is also
 suspected.  Given normal heart size, this is suspected non-cardiogenic
 pulmonary edema.
