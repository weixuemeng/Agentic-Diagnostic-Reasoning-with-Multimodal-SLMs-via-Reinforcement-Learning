                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with right chest pain, question fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  An old right rib
 deformity is noted, unchanged.  Please correlate with concurrently performed
 rib series to assess for displaced acute rib fractures.  The lungs appear
 clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears grossly unchanged.  Compression deformities in the thoracic
 spine are stable, compatible with patient's myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Old right lower rib deformity.  Please refer to
 concurrently performed rib series for evaluation of acute rib fracture.
