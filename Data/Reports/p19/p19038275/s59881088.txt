                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Low saturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is slight prominence of the interstitial
 markings which may be due to a mild interstitial edema, atypical infection not
 excluded.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Evidence of prior vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty is seen at the lower thoracic
 spine.
