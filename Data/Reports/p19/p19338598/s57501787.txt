                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low.  No convincing signs of pneumonia or CHF.  A vague rounded
 opacity projects over the left lung base for which CT is recommended on a
 non-emergent basis to further assess.  This opacity is only seen on the
 frontal projection and may represent superimposed shadows, though difficult to
 exclude a true pulmonary nodule.  No pneumothorax or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacity in the left lower lung for which non-emergent CT
 is recommended to further assess.
