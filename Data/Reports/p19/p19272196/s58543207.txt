                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:51 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Partial right nephrectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs from
 ___ and ___:
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy and the lung volumes are low,
 nevertheless, cardiac silhouette is wider than expected due to progressive
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion, and there is greater widening of the
 apparent mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch, which could be due to
 paramediastinal pleural fluid collection or, if the patient has had attempted
 line placement to mediastinal bleeding.  Clinical correlation advised.  As
 before, in addition to intact sternal wires there are multiple wire fragments
 in the midline.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead ends along the floor
 of the distal right ventricle.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
