                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AICD lead placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been minimal interval change.
 The lung volumes are decreased.  Redemonstrated is a right-sided AICD with
 leads noted to terminate within the right atrium and right ventricle.  There
 is no evidence of associated pneumothorax.  The patient is status post valve
 replacement with median sternotomy wires noted to be well-aligned. 
 Redemonstrated is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, likely exaggerated by the
 decreased lung volumes. Stable, widening of the mediastinum is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dual lead, right-sided AICD with leads seen terminating within the right
 atrium and right ventricle.
