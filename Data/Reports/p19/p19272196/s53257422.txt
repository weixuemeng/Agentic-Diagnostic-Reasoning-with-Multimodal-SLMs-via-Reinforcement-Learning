                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with suspected aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 There is progressive decrease in lung volumes, now markedly low, with
 resultant bibasilar atelectasis.  Significant opacity at the left base may
 reflect an additional component of effusion.  Though an infectious process or
 aspiration could be easily obscured, this is not specifically suggested on
 these radiographs.  A right pectoral single-lead pacer is unchanged, as is the
 alignment of median sternotomy wires, wire fragments, and prosthetic valve. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
