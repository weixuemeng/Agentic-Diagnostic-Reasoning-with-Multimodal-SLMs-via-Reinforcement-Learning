                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post partial right nephrectomy.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.  Chest tube on waterseal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 This portable view of the chest demonstrates a new or newly apparent right
 apical pneumothorax, small in volume.  Right chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis, in keeping with low lung
 volumes.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach.  A right chest wall pacer
 is in unchanged position.  The median sternotomy wires are in unchanged
 alignment.  There is widening of the mediastinal contours, unchanged from
 prior study.  If there has been recent attempted line placement, this could
 reflect presence of mediastinal hemorrhage, and clinical correlation is again
 advised, however review of many prior chest radiographs shows a similarly wide
 mediastinum in years past.  Free air under the right hemidiaphragm, is
 compatible with recent abdominal surgery.
