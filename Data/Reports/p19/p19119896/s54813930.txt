                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left PICC tip terminates within the upper
 SVC.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities at
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  T12 compression deformity and mild loss of height of the T9
 vertebral body are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
