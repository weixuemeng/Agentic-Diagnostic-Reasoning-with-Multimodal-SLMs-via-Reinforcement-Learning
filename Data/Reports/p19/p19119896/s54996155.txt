                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pseudomonas bacteremia with new oxygen requirement, to assess for
 fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 essentially within normal limits.  The fullness of the pulmonary vasculature
 is less prominent, though some of this may reflect the upright position.  The
 basilar opacification at the left has improved.  On the lateral view, there
 are bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 The upper lungs are essentially clear.
