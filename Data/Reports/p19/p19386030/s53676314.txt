 There are low lung volumes. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable. Patchy opacity is seen at the right lung base which may be due to
 pneumonia with possible atelectasis. Left basilar opacity is most likely due
 to atelectasis. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 trace pleural effusion and. No pneumothorax is seen. There has been interval
