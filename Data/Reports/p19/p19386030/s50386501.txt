                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:58 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with altered mental status.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Endotracheal tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, with the chin
 down, no less than 3.5 cm above the carina, and could be advanced 2 cm for
 more secured seating.  Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.  I do not see a central venous catheter.  Lung volumes are
 appreciably lower today than on ___ or ___.  Mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Pulmonary abnormalities are exaggerated by the low
 lung volumes, but left lung appears grossly clear.  There is atelectasis or
 consolidation at the base of the right.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.
 No pneumothorax.
