                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.  Evaluate placement of
 the endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina.  An orogastric
 tube is seen with the side port below the gastroesophageal junction and the
 tip out of view.  Other tubes and wires are likely external to the patient. 
 Otherwise, there are low lung volumes, accounting for some bronchovascular
 crowding. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgment and a trace right
 pleural effusion. Ill-defined linear opacities in both lung bases may reflect
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis,
 but aspiration is not excluded. Trace right pleural effusion.  Endotracheal
 and orogastric tubes in appropriate positions.
