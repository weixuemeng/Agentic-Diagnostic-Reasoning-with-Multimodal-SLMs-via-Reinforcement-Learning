                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant and right shoulder pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Left retrocardiac opacity likely
 represents atelectasis.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Erosive changes at the left glenoid
 and humeral head whic appear dislocated may be old but clinical correlation
 suggested.  Similar but perhaps less extensive changes seen at the right
 glenohumeral joint as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly limited by low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis; however, infection cannot be entirely excluded.
 Changes at the glenohumeral joints- including erosive changes on both sides of
 the joints and probable dislocations, left worse than right.  These changes
 may be old but please correlate clinically regarding need for further workup.
 
 The changes to the preliminary report regarding the glenohumoral findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 4:20 pm.
