                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pacemaker.  Evaluate lead placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left pectoral pacemaker with the leads in satisfactory
 position within the right atrium and right ventricle.  Linear opacities at the
 bilateral bases are most likely atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated in
 comparison to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of the left-sided pacemaker and its leads. 
 No pneumothorax.  Basilar opacities likely atelectasis.
