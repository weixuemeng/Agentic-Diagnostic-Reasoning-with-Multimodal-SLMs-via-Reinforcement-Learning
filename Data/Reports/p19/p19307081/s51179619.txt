                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hand laceration requiring surgery.  Preoperative chest
 radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are hyperexpanded, with slight flattening of the hemidiaphragms and
 expansion of the retrosternal airspace, suggestive of chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  Minimal atelectasis is seen within the left mid-to-lower
 lung.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Findings suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and should be
 correlated to any history of smoking.
