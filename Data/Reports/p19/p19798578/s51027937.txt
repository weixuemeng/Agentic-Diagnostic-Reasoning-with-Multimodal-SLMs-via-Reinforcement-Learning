                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  PICC placed, check position.
 
 A right PICC line has been placed.  Position of the tip cannot be determined. 
 The line can only be followed as far as the mid SVC.  This is likely the
 endpoint since this is the same position as it was on the prior chest x-ray of
 ___.
 
 The lungs remain clear.
