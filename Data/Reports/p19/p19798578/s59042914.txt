                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant and cecal mass, to assess for metastases to the
 chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Intact midline wires
 are in place.  The heart is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or appreciable atelectasis.
 
 There appears to be some calcification within coronary arteries, unchanged
 from previous studies.
