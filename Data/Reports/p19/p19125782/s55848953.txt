                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML with fungal pneumonia and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Increasing opacification at the bases with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragms suggests a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels.  It is unclear whether this reflects
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure or merely lower lung volumes.
