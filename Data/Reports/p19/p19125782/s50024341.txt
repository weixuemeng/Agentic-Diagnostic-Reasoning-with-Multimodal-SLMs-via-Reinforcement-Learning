                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate positioning of chest port, which is no longer working.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no marked change in the positioning of the chest wall port
 which terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  The study is
 otherwise unchanged with moderate bilateral pleural effusions as well as
 obscuration of the diaphragmatic contours due to atelectasis or airspace
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No marked interval change in the chest wall port.
 2.  Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
