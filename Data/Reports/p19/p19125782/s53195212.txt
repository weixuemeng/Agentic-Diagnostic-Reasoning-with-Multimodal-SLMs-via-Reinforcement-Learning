                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Neutropenia and acute myelogenous leukemia; patient presents with
 new fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper superior vena cava as before.
 The heart appears at the upper limits of normal size within the limitations of
 technique.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 again moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the
 left.  There is increased streaky opacification of the right lower lung in the
 neighborhood of the elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain
 clear.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to
 exclude a trace pleural effusion, although a pleural effusion is not
 definitively demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky new right basilar opacities which may be compatible with
 atelectasis in the setting of an elevated hemidiaphragm, but these are new and
 the possibility of pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful with PA and lateral
 technique to evaluate further if clinically indicated.
