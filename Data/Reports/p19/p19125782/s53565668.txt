                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chemotherapy due to AML, new non-productive cough.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and
 SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable with questionable
 interval increase of the cardiac silhouette, potentially may be related to
 diastolic versus systolic imaging.  Lungs are clear and there is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, unchanged as compared to multiple prior studies.
