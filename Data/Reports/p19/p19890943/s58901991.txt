                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and prior pericardial effusion now reported persistent cough,
 increased shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds with desaturation to
 ___% with exercise.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.

 There has been interval development of a large left pleural effusion with
 associated compressive atelectasis which shifts the cardiac silhouette to the

 be accurately gauged due to obliteration of the left cardiac border by the
 large effusion.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 distracted bony injury is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval development of a large left pleural effusion.  If there is history of
 recent trauma, hemothorax should be considered.  Other causes include
 infection or malignancy and malignancy, but the latter is less likely given
 the short interval time of development.
