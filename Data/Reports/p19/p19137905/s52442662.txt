                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Chest pain radiating to the back.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.
