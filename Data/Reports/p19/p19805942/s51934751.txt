                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and dyspnea on exertion.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Streaky opacities in the left mid
 lung and right lung base are nonspecific but most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis or scarring (no prior studies available for comparison). 
 Particularly along the right lateral chest wall, there are small horizontal
 subpleural lines, which may reflect subtle evidence for mild fluid overload or
 pulmonary venous congestion, but there is no frank evidence for congestive
 heart failure.  There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings which may suggest slight vascular congestion.  
 
 2.  Streaky multifocal opacities in the lower lungs, suggestive of chronic
 scarring, although acuity is difficult to judge without prior comparisons.  
 
 Correlation with prior radiographs may be helpful if available.  Otherwise,
 depending on the level of clinical concern for subtle early pneumonia,
 short-term follow-up radiographs, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if
 possible, could be considered.
