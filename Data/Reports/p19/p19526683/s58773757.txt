                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with multiple rib fractures and
 questionable pneumothorax.  Evaluate rib fractures and pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No
 mediastinal abnormalities are seen.  In the left apical area, a 2 x 3 cm
 calcified density is identified and represents a thyroid nodule in
 paratracheal position.  It is unchanged in comparison with previous
 examinations.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 infiltrates are present.  The left lateral and posterior pleural sinus remain
 free.  On the right side, there is mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinus
 extending into a 2 to 3 mm thickening of the pleural space along the lateral
 chest wall.  Possibility to examine skeletal structures in this patient is
 limited because of the patient's position.  There is, however, no evidence of
 any pneumothorax or any new pleural effusion based on comparison with the
 findings established on previous examination.  A chest CT examination of
 ___ is reviewed and it is noted that the patient had multiple rib
 fractures most obvious on the left side and also had evidence of small
 pneumothoraces at the time of the acute trauma.  There is no evidence of a
 remaining pneumothorax or acute infiltrate.  Detailed evaluation of rib
 fractures would require repeat chest examination.  It can be stated, however,
 that no major skeletal abnormality remains..
