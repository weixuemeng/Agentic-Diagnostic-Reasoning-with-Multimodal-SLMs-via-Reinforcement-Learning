                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is demonstrated
 without pulmonary edema. Calcified granuloma within the right lung base is
 unchanged. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, more so on the left.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
 Infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
