 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Low
 lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Retrocardiac
 opacification most likely reflects calcification of the mitral annulus,
 probably with mild atelectatic changes. Some indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vessels could reflect mild elevation pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of
 the costophrenic angle suggests is small pleural effusion on the left.
