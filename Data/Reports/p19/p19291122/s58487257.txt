 represent summation of bronchovascular bundles with the posterior ribs.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is present. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are seen.
 Bony callus from old right clavicular fracture is also noted.

 Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of moderate cardiomegaly. Apparent
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle is felt to represent summation of
 bronchovascular bundles with the posterior ribs.
