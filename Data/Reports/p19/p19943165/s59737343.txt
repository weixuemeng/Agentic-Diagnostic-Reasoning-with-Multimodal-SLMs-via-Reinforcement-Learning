  Hyperinflated lungs.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Prominent hila, particularly
  on the left, could be due to lymphadenopathy, prominent pulmonary arteries due
  to pulmonary hypertension, or overlapping vessels.  If indicated, could obtain
  a CT.  Nonspecific irregular calcifications overlying the right lower lung
  zone.  Results discussed with Dr. ___ at 720 PM on ___ via telephone by

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with 30 pack-year history of smoking now with
 worsening dysphagia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate general radiolucency within
 bilateral lungs to suggestive mild overinflation.  The lungs are otherwise
 without nodules, mass, or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is
 nonspecific calcification within the right lower lung zone which may represent
 calcification versus foreign body in or around the bronchi.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of mass or nodule.  Mild overinflation consistent with
 emphysematous changes.
