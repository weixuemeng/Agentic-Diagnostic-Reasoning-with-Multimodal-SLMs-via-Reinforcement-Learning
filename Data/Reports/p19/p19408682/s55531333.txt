                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 1.5 and 3 hours prior on the
 same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube terminating approximately 2.2 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube is
 unchanged in position, terminating in the stomach.  Lung volumes remain low,
 with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette.  The right hemidiaphragm is not
 as well seen, likely related to atelectasis.  MILD EDEMA HAS IMPROVED SINCE
 ___:11.  No obvious focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There may be minimal edema in the bilateral upper lung zones.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistently low lung volumes, with increased atelectasis in the right lower
 lung.  IMPROVED MILD EDEMA.
