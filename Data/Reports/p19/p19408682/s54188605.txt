                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post arrest*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina.
 Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and coils in the expected location of
 the stomach.  There are low lung volumes, which likely in part accentuate the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The superior mediastinum is widened.  If there
 is clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, suggest chest CTA. 
 Difficult to exclude small left pleural effusion.  Relative opacity over the
 right lung is nonspecific but underlying pulmonary contusion not excluded.
