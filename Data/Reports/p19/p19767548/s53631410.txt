                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PA AND LATERAL, ___ AT 3:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 20:43.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 3:28 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian catheter remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, with the heart being
 mildly enlarged.  There is increasing prominence to the interstitium in the
 right mid and lower lobe as well as in the retrocardiac region.  These
 findings in the setting of a new fever and cough could reflect an atypical
 infection.  Therefore, clinical correlation is advised.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Somewhat dense vertebra
 likely related to the patient's known chronic renal disease.
