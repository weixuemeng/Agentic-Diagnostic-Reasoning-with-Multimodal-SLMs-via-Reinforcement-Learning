                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD on HD with three failed IJ attempts, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is some increasing opacification at the left base
 suggesting some volume loss and possible pleural fluid. There is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of engorged
 vessels, suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
