                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 has been interval removal of a left tunneled dialysis catheter with interval
 placement of a right tunneled dialysis catheter, with its tip ending in the
 high right atrium.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without
 frank interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation.  The
 heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is increased sclerosis of
 the vertebral body endplates throughout the thoracic spine, best appreciated
 on the lateral projection, suggestive of renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.
 
 2.  No focal consolidation.
