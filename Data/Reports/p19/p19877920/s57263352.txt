 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Swelling, melena, neutropenia.  Evaluation for pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes continue to be large, potentially suggesting mild
 overinflation.  This is supported by minimally flattened diaphragms on the
 lateral view.  The presence of a 7-mm dense nodule projecting over the
 anterior aspect of vertebral body on the lateral radiograph is unchanged.  No
 other nodules are visible.  No pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
