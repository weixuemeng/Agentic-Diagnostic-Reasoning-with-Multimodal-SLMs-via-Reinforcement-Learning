 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increase in the
 substantial subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall, with little
 change in the appearance on the left.  The increased gas in soft tissues on
 the right raises the possibility of an air leak.  Extensive pneumomediastinum
 is again seen.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications have not improved.
