                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  NG tube pulled out, question replaced.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach which is moderately
 distended.  There are large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left that have increased compared to the study from five days prior. 
 Right-sided PICC line with tip in the mid SVC is unchanged.  There is
 pulmonary vascular redistribution and bilateral alveolar infiltrates.  The
 overall impression is that of worsened fluid overload.
