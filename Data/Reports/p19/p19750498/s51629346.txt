 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV Hodgkin's disease, pleural effusions, increased
 crackles.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 interstitial markings at both lung bases, combined to an increase of pleural
 effusions bilaterally.  The extent of these effusions is moderate at the
 current time point.  They occupy approximately one-third of the left and right
 hemithorax.
 
 In unchanged manner, areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No other parenchymal opacities.  No
 pneumothorax.
