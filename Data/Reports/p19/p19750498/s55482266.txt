 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypothermia, hypotension, infection? edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___

 Right-sided PICC line is in adequate position in lower SVC.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Lung volumes are lower with crowding of bronchovascular structures at lung
 bases.  Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in appropriate
 clinical settings.
