                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent fall, unresponsive, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is probable
 mild right convex curvature of the mid thoracic spine, accounting for
 visualization of the aortic knob and proximal descending aorta.  There is no
 CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected. No rib
 fracture is detected on this lung technique film.  
 
 Thin curvilinear lucency underlying the left hemidiaphragm is noted -- in the
 absence of concern for a GI pathology, this may represent air within the
 splenic flexure of the colon.  Otherwise, no free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process identified. ? air within splenic
 flexure of colon -- please see comment above.
