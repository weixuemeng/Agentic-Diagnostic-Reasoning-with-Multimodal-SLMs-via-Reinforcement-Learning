                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, low oxygen
 saturation and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with faint reticular
 interstitial opacity, stable since the prior study, suggesting preexisting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The very inferior posterior
 costophrenic angles are excluded from the lateral view.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
