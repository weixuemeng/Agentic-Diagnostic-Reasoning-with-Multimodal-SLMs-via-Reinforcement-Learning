                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Deep brain stimulator device packs are noted overlying the anterior chest
 walls bilaterally.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen.  There
 is minimal patchy left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggests
 trace pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions
 posteriorly.
