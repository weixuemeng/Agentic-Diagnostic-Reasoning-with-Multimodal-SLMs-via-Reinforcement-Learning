                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for CHF, edema, effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged and there is pulmonary edema with a small right and a moderate left
 pleural effusion.  Associated left lower lobe atelectasis is likely present,
 though cannot exclude pneumonia.  Bony structures appear grossly intact. 
 Vascular calcifications along the thoracic aorta noted.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Calcifications projecting over the right upper quadrant
 likely reflect costal cartilage calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and moderate
 cardiomegaly.
