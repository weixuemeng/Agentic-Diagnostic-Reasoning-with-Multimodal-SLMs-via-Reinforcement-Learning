                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with mild dyspnea on exertion, history
 of coronary artery disease, diabetes and hypertension, evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple
 surgical clips in the anterior left-sided mediastinum indicative of previous
 bypass surgery.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement mostly involving the
 left ventricle which is prominent to the left and posteriorly but also a
 moderate enlargement of the left atrium is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature
 shows an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no evidence of
 advanced interstitial or alveolar edema.  The lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free.  No localized discrete parenchymal infiltrates suggesting
 pneumonia.  The apical areas do not disclose the presence of any pneumothorax.
 Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits with the
 exception of the described sternotomy.  When comparison is made with the next
 preceding chest examination of ___, the findings are stable. 
 Sternotomy wires and status post bypass surgery existed already at that time.
