                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p STEMI and cardiac arrest intubated with
 increasing vent settings  // ?Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 09:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 1.5 cm above carina.  Enteric tube tip
 is below diaphragm, not included on the radiograph.  Sternotomy.  There is
 increasing left basilar opacification, with associated volume loss, consistent
 with atelectasis, with probable component of mildly increasing effusion. 
 Stable right basilar opacification, likely edema.  There is stable probably
 mild right pleural effusion.  It is difficult to estimate cardiac size cava
 left basilar opacification.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significantly increased left lung opacification, with associated mild volume
 loss, likely at least in part from atelectasis, with probable component of
 worsening left pleural effusion.  Stable right basilar opacity, likely edema.
