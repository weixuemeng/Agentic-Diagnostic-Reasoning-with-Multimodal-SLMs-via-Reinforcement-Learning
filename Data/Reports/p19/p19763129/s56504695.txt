                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, status post bone marrow transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The tip of
 the right-sided central venous catheter is difficult to assess due to multiple
 overlying structures, but may be within the right atrium.  Round sclerotic
 focus projecting over the anterior lateral right third rib is again seen. 
 Additionally, there is now a 9 mm ovoid density projecting over the region of
 the posterior right ninth, anterior right fifth rib, which may be osseous,
 pulmonary, or external to the patient.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two rounded densities projecting over the right chest, one seen
 previously in the anterior lateral right third rib.  An additional one
 projecting over the anterior right sixth rib, unclear whether external to the
 patient, osseous, or pulmonary in nature.  Suggest repeat with nipple markers
 for further evaluation.
