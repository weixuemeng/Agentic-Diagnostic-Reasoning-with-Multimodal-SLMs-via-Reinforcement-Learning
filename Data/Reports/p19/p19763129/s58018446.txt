                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:31 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There is no focal consolidation.  Heart is normal size but definitely larger
 today than before, and the pulmonary vasculature is engorged.  Perhaps patient
 is in volume overload.  Supraclavicular dual-channel catheter ends at the
 superior cavoatrial junction, as before.  Pleural effusion is small if any.
