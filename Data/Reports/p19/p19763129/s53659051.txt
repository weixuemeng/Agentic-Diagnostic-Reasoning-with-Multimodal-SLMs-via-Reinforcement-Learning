                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chronic lymphatic leukemia.
 
 CHEST:  Heart and mediastinum are normal.  In the right upper lobe laterally
 overlying the fifth rib posteriorly, a nodule is present measuring 11 mm. 
 Immediately adjacent, a further nodule is seen, both of which appear to have
 some calcium within them.  This likely represents some old granuloma, but
 comparison with prior chest x-rays if available should be made.  Elsewhere,
 the lung fields appear clear, the costophrenic angles sharp.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung nodule, probably old granuloma but comparison with
 prior chest x-ray is necessary with none available CT should be performed.
