                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Possible pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mild fluid overload.  Retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral areas of
 atelectasis are slightly better than on the previous image.  However, subtle
 parenchymal opacities at the left lung bases persist, raising the previously
 documented suspicion for a developing pneumonia.  The lung volumes remain low.
 The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
