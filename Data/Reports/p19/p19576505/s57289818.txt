                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Temporal bone fracture.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 3.1 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the
 field of view.  
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is increased
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite pneumonia is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes with increased atelectasis.  No definite
 pneumonia, though if there is high clinical concern, continued radiographic
 follow-up is recommended.
