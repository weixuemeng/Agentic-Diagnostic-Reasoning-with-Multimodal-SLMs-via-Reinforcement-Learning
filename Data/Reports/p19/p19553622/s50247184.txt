                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVA, intubation, acute lung process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 An ET tube is present, at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately
 4.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm
 overlying gastric fundus.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is quite prominent and atypical, but likely
 distorted by markedly low inspiratory volumes.  Patchy opacity at left greater
 than right lung bases is also likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. 
 No obvious pneumothorax is detected.  No gross effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette due to low
 inspiratory volumes.  The possibility of opacity about the left hilar region
 cannot be excluded.  Allowing for technical differences, the appearance is
 similar to the film obtained at 2:11 a.m. the same day.  There is opacity at
 right greater than left lung apices, similar to a chest CTA from one day
 earlier.  However, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is less well-defined than
 the trauma films from ___.  Clinical correlation is therefore requested.
