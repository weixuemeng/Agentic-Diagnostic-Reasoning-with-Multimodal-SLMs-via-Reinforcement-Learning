                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall 6 feet onto concrete.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinum is widened, though this partially may be due to supine positioning
 and low inspiratory volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 noted, but no pulmonary edema is seen.  Hazy rounded opacity is seen within
 the left mid lung field, which is nonspecific but could reflect an area of
 contusion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and
 supine positioning.  However, if there is continued clinical concern for
 mediastinal injury, then a dedicated chest CTA is suggested.
 
 2. Nonspecific ill-defined opacity within the left mid lung field.  This could
 reflect an area of contusion.
 
 3. No displaced rib fractures are identified.
