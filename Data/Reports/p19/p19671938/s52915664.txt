                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a
 calcified nodule projecting over the superior segment of the right upper lobe
 suggesting a granuloma. There may be a small calcified lymph node on the
 right. Streaky opacities at the left lung base are unchanged and suggest very
 minor scarring. Otherwise the lungs remain clear. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
