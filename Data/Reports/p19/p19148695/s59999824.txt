 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is similar with
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications noted. Low lung volumes are
 demonstrated with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Focal opacity in the retrocardiac region is
 concerning for pneumonia with blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggestive of a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia and trace left pleural effusion. Low lung volumes
 with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion
