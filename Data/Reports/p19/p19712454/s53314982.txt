                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with leg swelling
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Lung volumes are slightly low which causes mild
 crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 present. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. Assessment of the right lung apex is is slightly obscured by the
 patient's neck and chin projecting over this region, but no pneumothorax is
 identified. No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is present. There are
 moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and bibasilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
