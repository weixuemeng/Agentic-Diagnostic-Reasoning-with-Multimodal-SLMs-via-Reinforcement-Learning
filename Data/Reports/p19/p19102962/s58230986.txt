                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question right lower lobe collapse on scout imaging.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to CT cervical spine from ___, earlier today
 at 17:28 as well as prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No evidence of right lower
 lobe collapse seen in the current study.  Upon further review of the scout
 radiograph from cervical spine CT, the opacity projecting over the right lower
 hemithorax likely represents the patient's overlying hand.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
