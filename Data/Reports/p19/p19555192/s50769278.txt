                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SSS (??) status post biventricular pacemaker implant, continued
 chest pain.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:48 a.m. Targeted review of a chest
 CT from ___ at 14:18 p.m.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to ___ chest x-ray, there is new patchy opacity at the right lung
 base, slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, AND minimal, if any,
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  No gross left effusion.  No CHF. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.  Biventricular pacemaker again noted.
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New or worsened right base patchy opacity.  Differential
 diagnosis includes aspiration or an early pneumonic infiltrate.  Atelectasis
 is in the differential, but considered less likely, as there also appears to
 be a small right effusion.
