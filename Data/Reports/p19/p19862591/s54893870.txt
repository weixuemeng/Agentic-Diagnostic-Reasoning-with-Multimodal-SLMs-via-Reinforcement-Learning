                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypotension, s/p small bowel resection  //
 please evaluate for infiltrates, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild transverse cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild
 interstitial thickening.  Small left-sided pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Unfolded aortic arch and rotation contribute to a widened
 mediastinum.  Degenerative bony changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion with associated interstitial edema and a small
 left-sided pleural effusions suggest fluid overload/ cardiac decompensation. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 Unfolded aortic arch and rotation are most likely responsible for the widened
 mediastinum, but correlation with a PA erect, non rotated radiograph is
 advised.
