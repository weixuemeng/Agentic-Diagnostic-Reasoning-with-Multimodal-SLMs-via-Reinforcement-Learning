                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Aside from patchy basilar opacities most suggestive of minor atelectasis in
 association with low lung volumes, the lungs appear clear.  The bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight basilar opacities suggestive of mild volume loss with no
 definite evidence for acute disease.
