 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TAVI; evaluate the position of the recently
 placed pacemaker leads.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left-sided two-lead cardiac pacemaker device appears intact and unchanged
 in position, with one tip terminating in the right atrium and the other tip
 terminating in the right ventricle. Median sternotomy wires, surgical clips,
 and cardiac valve replacements appear intact and unchanged in position. The
 right IJ also appears intact and unchanged in position.
 
 Since ___, the left-sided pleural effusion and adjacent compressive
 atelectasis have improved.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists and
 is secondary to underlying left lung atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise
 clear, without focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly. Stable post-procedural appearance of the
 mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Upper open positioning of the recently placed pacemaker leads.
 
 2.  Decreased, now small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis
 compared to ___.
