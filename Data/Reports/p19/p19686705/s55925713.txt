 pain/swelling after fall yesterday.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low.
 Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for subtle opacity in the lower
 lungs. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of
 pneumonia or CHF. The heart size appears within normal limits. The aorta is
 slightly unfolded.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
