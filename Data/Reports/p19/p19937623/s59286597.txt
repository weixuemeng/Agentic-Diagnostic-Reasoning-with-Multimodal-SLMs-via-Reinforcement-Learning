                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with COPD and new ETT placement.  New OG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of
 ET tube in standard position with distal tip 2 cm above the level of the
 carina.  There has been mild interval worsening of the left basilar
 opacification, likely representing consolidation as well as mild interval
 worsening of the right basilar opacification, which likely represents pleural
 fluid.  Esophageal feeding tube is seen in standard position below the level
 of the diaphragm with distal tip in the proximal stomach.  Two pigtail
 catheters are seen projecting over the left and right mid abdomen,
 respectively The previously demonstrated pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly are
 unchanged on this exam.    There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Mild interval worsening of bilateral basilar opacifications. 
 Left basilar opacity is likely consolidation.  Right basilar opacity is likely
 pleural fluid.  Pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly are unchanged since the prior
 study.  ET tube and OG tube in standard position.
