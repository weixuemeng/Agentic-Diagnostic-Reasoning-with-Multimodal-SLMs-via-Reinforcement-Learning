                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which appear
 similar in size from the prior CT of the chest in ___.  There are
 prominent interstitial markings, which likely represent mild pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar hazy opacities are most consistent with atelectasis.  There is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax.  The mediastinal silhouette is normal.  The
 cardiac silhouette is difficult to fully evaluate, as the left heart border is
 obscured by the adjacent pleural effusion, but appears mildly enlarged, and
 stable from the prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
 2.  Prominent interstitial markings are likely due to mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 4.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
