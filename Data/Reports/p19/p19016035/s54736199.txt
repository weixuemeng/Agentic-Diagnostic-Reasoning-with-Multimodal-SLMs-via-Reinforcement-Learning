                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with fevers, chills, and 3
 days of productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hyperinflated lungs.  Retrocardiac bronchial wall thickening
 and air bronchograms are unchanged compared to ___, and likely represent
 chronic bronchitis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Apical pleural thickening is noted bilaterally.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity is likely chronic bronchitis, without evidence of acute
 pneumonia.
