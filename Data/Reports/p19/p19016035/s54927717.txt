                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with head strike, fall, + EtOH, on xarelto  // ?
 traumatic injuries
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  Apical scarring is
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
