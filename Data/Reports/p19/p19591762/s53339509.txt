                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Patchy and linear left
 lower lobe opacity with associated volume loss is present, as well as a focal
 linear opacity in the right lower lobe.  Remainder of lungs are clear.  No
 definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Patchy and linear left lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis over
 infectious pneumonia.
 
 2.  No acute fracture within the visualized portion of the thoracic spine, but
 dedicated radiographs or cross-sectional imaging of the spine may be
 considered if clinical suspicion for a thoracic spine abnormality is high.
