                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest PA and LAT
 
 HISTORY: SOB, weakness, crackles, assess for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.  No pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.  Given patient history,
 most consistent with pulmonary edema.  Other etiologies and differential
 diagnosis include widespread infection and pulmonary hemorrhage.  Correlate
 clinically and recommend repeat radiograph after diuresis to assess for
 underlying consolidation.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
