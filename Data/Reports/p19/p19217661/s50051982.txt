                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer with concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the right atrium.  There is no
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation. A tiny pleural effusion is smaller. There
 are coarse interstial markings throughout both lungs, with some plueral
 thickening at the left base.  The heart size is normal, and the hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Surgical clips are again seen
 within the right axilla. The patient is post bilateral mastectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminating within the right atrium.
 3.  Coarse bilateral interstial markings with and left basilar pleural pleural
 thickening and tiny effusion are likely chronic. Comparison with any OSH
 cross-sectional examinations can be made if available.
