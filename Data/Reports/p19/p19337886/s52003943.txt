                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ PET-CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the lower SVC. 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities in the
 right mid and lower lung fields, as well as the left lung base likely reflect
 subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Previously demonstrated FDG avid right lower lobe
 pulmonary nodule is better assessed on the recent PET-CT. Clips are noted
 projecting over the right hemidiaphragm. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the lung bases and right mid lung field. No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise identified.
