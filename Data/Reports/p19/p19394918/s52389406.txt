                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are lower in volume compared to
 the previous examination with increased bibasilar predominantly linear
 opacities consistent with atelectasis.  No definite effusion is seen although
 trace left effusion would be difficult to entirely exclude.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart is top-normal in size with normal mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities are most likely atelectasis.
