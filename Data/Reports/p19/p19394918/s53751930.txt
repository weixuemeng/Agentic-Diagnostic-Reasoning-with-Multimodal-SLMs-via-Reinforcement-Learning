                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting, an early infectious process is not excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy somewhat linear in configuration bibasilar opacities most
 likely represent atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting, an
 infectious process is not excluded.
