                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after intubation for
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.
 
 As compared to prior study obtained on ___, there is interval
 improvement of the aeration of the central portion of the left lung, most
 likely representing improvement of atelectasis.  Large and at least partially
 layering pleural effusion is redemonstrated on the left with at least moderate
 right pleural effusion.  Mild progression of vascular engorgement/minimal
 pulmonary edema is noted as well.  ET tube and NG tube are in appropriate
 position.
