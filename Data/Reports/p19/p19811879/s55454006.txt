                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Assessment of ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ obtained at 12:17
 p.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  Left hemithorax is entirely
 opacified that given the presence of right mediastinal shift is most likely
 due to large amount of pleural effusion, although atelectasis is potentially
 present.  Right pleural effusion is small to moderate, grossly unchanged.
