                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is nearly complete opacification of the hemithorax but
 without substantial net shift of mediastinal structures.  This may reflect a
 large pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or pneumonia but is
 incompletely characterized.  Patchy opacification is noted in the right mid to
 lower lung with a suspected small pleural effusion on the right.  The
 pulmonary vascularity in the right lung is mildly prominent, suggesting mild
 fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
 balanced mass effect, suggesting a large pleural effusion among other
 potential causes, including the possibility of malignancy.  Chest CT may be
 useful to evaluate further if clinically indicated.
