                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rib fractures on R after scooter vs. truck
 accident, resp failure, now intubated  // Interval change, tube position
 ___ year old man with multi trauma, likely pulm contustions on cxr, abdominal
 bleeding, now with increasing O2 req.  // Any new consolidation or effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable AP radiographs of the chest from ___ at
 00:52 and 05:29.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The radiograph obtained at 00:52 hours shows new small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right. Lung volumes remain low. However, there is
 evidence of new mild pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The known right ___ thoracic rib
 fracture is not seen on this exam.
 
 The followup radiograph of 05:29 hours shows increased elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, likely due to a combination of worsening atelectasis and
 pleural effusion. An endotracheal tube has also been placed, terminating at
 the level of the clavicles.  There is increased opacification along the right
 paratracheal location, which could be due to a developing hematoma. The left
 lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification along the right paratracheal location may be due to a
 developing hematoma.  A repeat CTA chest is recommended when clinically
 feasible.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:42 AM, 30 minutes after discovery of the
