                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo male s/p scooter vs truck with splenic lac s/p splenic
 artery embolization ___, liver lac, rib fx now w/ ARDS  // s/p bronch;
 interval change and r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened since ___, but previous
 consolidation in the right lower lung has improved, presumably a function of
 improving aeration in an area of atelectasis.  Mild infiltrative abnormality
 in the remainder of the right lung could due to aspiration or the asymmetric
 residual of edema.  There is probably no large pneumothorax but anterior left
 pleural air could be missed in this image of the supine patient, even with the
 thoracostomy tube in place.  Heart is normal size.
 ET tube, left subclavian line, and nasogastric tube are in standard
 placements.
