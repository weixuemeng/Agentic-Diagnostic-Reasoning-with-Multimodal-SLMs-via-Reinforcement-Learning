 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube 4.5 cm from the carina with the chin down is
 acceptable. Two nasogastric tubes pass as far as the distal esophagus and out
 of view.  The left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  Despite the
 indwelling left thoracostomy tube, moderate to large left pleural effusion
 persists, probably responsible for left lower lobe collapse.  Slightly smaller
 right pleural effusion is larger today and there is more consolidation in the
 right lower lung either also collapse or pneumonia.  Heart is normal size. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
