                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS  // interval change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Left upper lobe is spared what is otherwise a diffuse pulmonary process, most
 pronounced in the densely consolidated left lower lobe.  If this is ARDS,
 there needs to be some explanation for its absence in the left upper lung. 
 Perhaps there is an obstructing pulmonary embolus.  Alternatively this may not
 be ARDS and may instead be multi focal pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 Left thoracostomy tube in place.  Left pneumothorax is not excluded in this
 image of a non erect patient.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
 ET tube is in standard placement.  An intended esophageal probe ends at the
 thoracic inlet, and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.  Heart is normal size.
