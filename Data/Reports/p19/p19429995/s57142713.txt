                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  A week of severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back with
 tenderness to palpation on exam, reported dyspnea.  Assess cardiopulmonary
 disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  2 cm left paracardiac round opacity described on ___ exam is
 persistent.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours
 are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Persistent left paracardiac nodularity could be investigated by
 CT scan.  This will also allow us to evaluate the chest pain.
