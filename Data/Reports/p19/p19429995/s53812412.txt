                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, dyspnea and fever.  Evaluate for
 possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph from ___:
 
 It is possible that a 2 cm wide ring shadow seen on the frontal chest
 radiograph, projected over the left sixth rib anteriorly and on the lateral
 view over the lowest thoracic vertebral body in its entirety is a cavity.  It
 is also possible that both of these findings are composite shadows of normal
 structures.  Oblique views might be helpful; CT scanning would be definitive. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.  Heart size is normal.  Dr. ___ ___ I
 discussed the findings by telephone and further evaluation.
