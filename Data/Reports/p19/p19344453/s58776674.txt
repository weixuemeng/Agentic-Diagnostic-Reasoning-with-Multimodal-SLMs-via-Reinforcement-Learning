                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC has changed in position, now terminating at the right
 tracheobronchial angle, with distal tip directed superiorly.  It is uncertain
 whether this is extending superiorly into the right brachiocephalic vein or
 coursing posteriorly into the azygous vein at this level.  In either case,
 repositioning is advised, as communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  Within the lungs, widespread pulmonary nodules have apparently
 progressed since ___.  Differential diagnosis includes a
 granulomatous infection from fungal or mycobacterial organisms versus
 widespread pulmonary metastases.  Focal opacity in left retrocardiac region
 may be due to focal atelectasis and less likely an area of localized
 pneumonia.
