 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:27 PM
  Similar degree of interstitial reticulation likely representing edema
  superimposed on chronic fibrotic change. Improved aeration of the lung base on
  the left. Otherwise no change.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread fibrotic lung disease appears similar to the recent
 radiograph, but a superimposed consolidative opacity in left upper lobe
 peripherally has apparently worsened and could reflect a developing pneumonia
 or site of aspiration.  Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph would be
 helpful for confirmation and characterization when the patient's condition
 permits.
