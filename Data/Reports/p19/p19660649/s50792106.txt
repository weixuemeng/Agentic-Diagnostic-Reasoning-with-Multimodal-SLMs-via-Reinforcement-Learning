                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o HTN, pulmonary disease of unclear
 etiology, and AAA s/p endovcascular repair complicated by NSTEMI s/p cardiac
 cath demonstrating 3VD with cath complicated by V fib arrest  // Hypoxia and
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear branching opacities projecting over the right mid and lower lung may be
 external to the patient.   The lung volumes are persistently low, with
 bilateral fibrotic changes and parenchymal opacities, similar in appearance
 since the prior study. A right internal jugular approach Swan Ganz catheter is
 unchanged in position, with tip terminating in the left pulmonary artery.  The
 heart size is stable. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. An
 aortic stent graft projecting over the mid abdomen is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear branching opacities projecting over the right mid and lower lung are
 likely external to the patient, but could also represent fissural fluid. In
 order to resolve this, a repeat radiograph is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.  ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 1:23 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings. After this discussion, Dr. ___ ___ the patient was to have
 a repeat chest CT this afternoon.
