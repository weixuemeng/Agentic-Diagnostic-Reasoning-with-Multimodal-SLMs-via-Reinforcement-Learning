                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSTEMI, recent v. fib arrest, respiratory
 distress  // signs of infection or volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen evidence of previous endovascular repair of AAA.
 
 The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The bilateral hila are not
 well visualized.
 
 There are again seen low lung volumes and widespread increased interstitial
 opacities consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis. Grossly, there is no
 interval change in appearance of lungs in comparison to prior radiograph,
 although evaluation for secondary processes such as superimposed infection is
 limited given the extent of fibrosis.
 
 There is poor visualization of the right lateral CP angle which may signify a
 small right pleural effusion, although this is difficult to evaluate given
 extensive fibrosis.  There are no pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and interstitial opacities consistent with known pulmonary
 fibrosis. Possible small right pleural effusion.  No other significant
 interval changes.
