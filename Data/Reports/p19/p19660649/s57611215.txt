  Previously noted linear opacities projecting over the right lung are no longer

  substantial change otherwise.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung volumes
 that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Prominence of
 interstitial markings again could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure
 superimposed on diffuse fibrotic changes.  Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 removed.
