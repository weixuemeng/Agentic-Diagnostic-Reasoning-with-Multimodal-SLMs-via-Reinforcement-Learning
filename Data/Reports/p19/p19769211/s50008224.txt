                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of recent pneumonia and
 elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There is also
 mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is slight blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angle on the frontal view, not well substantiated on
 the lateral view, may be due to overlying soft tissue on the frontal view. 
 There is mild right base opacity, which appears to be somewhat linear in
 configuration, more likely atelectasis, although underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  No recent priors with reported diagnosis of pneumonia are
 available for comparison.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature may be accentuated by the low lung volumes.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
