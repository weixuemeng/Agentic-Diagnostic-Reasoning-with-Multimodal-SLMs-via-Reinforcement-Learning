                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with high B-cell lymphoma and recent
 bowel perforation status post sigmoid colectomy, now with peritonitis, left
 rib pain, shortness of breath, recent tap of left lung.  Study requested for
 evaluation of pleural effusion, pneumonia and/or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and prior abdomnal/pelvic CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Right PICC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. As compared to prior
 chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are improved. Right pleural
 effusion may be smaller.  There is minimal if any change on the left,
 including unchanged left basal atelectasis and a small pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Substantial distention of gas-containing viscus in
 the left upper quadrant is likely the stomach.  There is evidence of cervical
 fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable decrease of small right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Unchanged appearance of left lung, with left basilar atelectasis and small
 pleural effusion.
