                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lymphoma and recent colonic perforation,
 status post sigmoid colectomy and ostomy, now with persistent fevers.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An anterior cervical spinal fusion device is present.  The right
 PICC tip terminates at the low SVC.  The lung volumes are low with a prominent
 gastric bubble seen beneath the left hemidiaphragm resulting in atelectasis,
 more prominent on the left than the right.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with atelectasis, worse on the left than the
 right, although in the appropriate clinical setting, left-sided pneumonia is a
 possibility.
