                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Preop right foot.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING.  
 
 New right subclavian PICC line is present.  The tip is poorly visualized, but
 likely overlies the distal SVC.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is
 identified.  Compared with ___, minimal blunting at the right
 costophrenic angle has cleared.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process identified.
