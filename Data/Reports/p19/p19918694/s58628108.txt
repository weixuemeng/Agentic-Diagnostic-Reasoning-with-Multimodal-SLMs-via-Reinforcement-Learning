                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement in holding area preoperatively.
 
 FINDINGS:  Technically limited study related to extensive scattered radiation
 reflecting the size of the patient.  The right PICC line is barely seen in the
 axillary region and then is quickly lost once it enters the lungs.  A repeat
 study with improved technique would be necessary for further evaluation.  
 
 The lungs are grossly within normal limits.
