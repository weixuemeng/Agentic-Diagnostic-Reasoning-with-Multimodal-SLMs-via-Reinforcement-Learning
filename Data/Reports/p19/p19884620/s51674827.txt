                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis and resp insufficiency  // pleas
 assess lung status for extubation      pleas assess lung status for extubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change
 in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices. Again there is
 diffuse haziness of the hemithoraces, consistent with substantial layering
 pleural effusions with underlying compressive atelectasis at the bases.  There
 may be some mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though this is
 difficult to assess in view of the substantial pleural effusions.
