  The ET tube and NG tube are in expected position. A right PICC line ends in
  the right atrium. There are low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely
  reflecting a combination of moderate pleural effusions and atelectasis
  although underlying pneumonia is possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute pancreatitis, transfer from OSH  //
 please assess tubes, lines, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC terminates within the right atrium. Endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Bibasilar atelectasis is accompanied by moderate right and small left
 pleural effusions. Additional patchy left suprahilar opacity could reflect
 atelectasis, aspiration, or focal pneumonia. In the absence of older
 radiographs for comparison, short-term followup radiographs are recommended to
 exclude a neoplastic process in this region.
