                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatis, pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:14 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. 
 An NG or other orogastric tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the
 diaphragm over the gastric fundus and possibly more distal to that.PICC line
 tip overlies the SVC/RA junction. Again seen is a small radiodensity overlying
 the left upper quadrant of the abdomen -- ? tiny foreign body.  No ptx
 detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by findings in the
 lungs, but appears enlarged and unchanged. There is probable upper zone
 redistribution.  There are large bilateral layering effusions, with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, on both sides.   The extent of the effusions is
 probably similar to the prior film.
