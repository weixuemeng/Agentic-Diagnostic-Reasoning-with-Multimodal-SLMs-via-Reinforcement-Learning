                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and decreased breath sounds on the left.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As on yesterday's exam the patient is rotated but to a lesser degree.  Lung
 volumes are increased and there is no mild hyperexpansion.  There are no focal
 airspace opacities to suggest pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The
 mediastinum appears normal.  Tortuosity of the aorta is re- demonstrated.  
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild hyperexpansion is compatible with COPD.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 2. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
