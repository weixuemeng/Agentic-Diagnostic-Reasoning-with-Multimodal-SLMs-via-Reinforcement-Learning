 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change.  The
 current examination again is obtained with the patient obliquely turned
 towards the right.  Extensive opacification is again seen on the left.  This
 most likely rib represents continued pneumonia or possible pulmonary
 hemorrhage, but does not have the appearance of pulmonary edema.
 Again there is increased opacification at the right base laterally, consistent
 with small pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the right lower
 lobe.
