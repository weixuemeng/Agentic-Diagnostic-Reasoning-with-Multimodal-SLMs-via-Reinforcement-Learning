 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LT ischemic stroke  // Please assess for
 DHT placement      Please assess for DHT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube with its tip extending into the stomach.  The side-port is at
 the level of the cavoatrial junction, and the tube should be pushed forward
 several cm for more optimal positioning.
 Opacification at the right base suggests volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  Less prominent changes are seen at the left base.
