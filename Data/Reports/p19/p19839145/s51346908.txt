                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sepsis  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___.  And CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   Patient is rotated significantly to
 her right limiting evaluation.  Previously noted feeding tube has been
 removed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the right and difficult
 to assess.  Opacity at the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis and
 effusion.  Difficult to exclude pneumonia.  Haziness of the left lung base
 likely reflects bronchovascular markings given rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited due to patient rotation.  Probable right basal effusion and
 atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude lung base pneumonia.
