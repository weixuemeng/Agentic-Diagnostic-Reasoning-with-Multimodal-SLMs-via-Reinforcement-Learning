 follow up effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 19:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, and mediastinal
 and chest tubes are unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy for CABG with expected postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  Interval improvement in aeration of the left lung but persistent
 mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Layering left effusion
 with more focal patchy airspace disease at the left base favoring atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No obvious pneumothorax.
