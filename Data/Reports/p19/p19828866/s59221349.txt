                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with
 crowding of bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar opacifications appear
 consistent with atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are mildly accentuated by low lung volumes.
