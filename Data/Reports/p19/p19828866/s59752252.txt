                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis, renal failure, now
 with small-bowel obstruction, status post NG-tube placement, evaluate
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph is obtained.  There is interval
 placement of an NG tube that is located below the diaphragm with the tip not
 clearly visualized.  Heart is top normal size and cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Lungs are well expanded with evidence of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Small bibasilar atelectasis.  No significant pleural
 effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tip of NG tube is below the level of the diaphragms, but exact location
 cannot be established due to underpenetration.  Abdominal or repeat chest
 radiograph with increased penetration and lower centering could be obtained to
 assess tip location if clinically indicated.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
