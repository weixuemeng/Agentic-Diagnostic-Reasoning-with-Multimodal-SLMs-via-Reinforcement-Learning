 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications, which appear somewhat less prominent than on the
 previous study.  Again, this most likely represents pulmonary edema, though in
 the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia or even ARDS would
 have to be considered.  Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
 atelectasis at the bases are again seen.
 The right subclavian PICC line again extends only to the upper to midportion
 of the SVC.
