                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph and rib series dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent sternal fracture, now with congestion, decreased
 appetite and hyperglycemia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Old right seventh, eighth, ninth and likely tenth posterior rib
 fractures show signs of interval healing.  There is blunting of the right CP
 angle as well as the left which likely indicates tiny pleural effusions.  The
 heart is within normal limits of size.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  An old left clavicular mid shaft deformity is again
 seen.  A deformity involving the mid body of the sternum is seen on the
 lateral view, which appears increasingly displaced.
