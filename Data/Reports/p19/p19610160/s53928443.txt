                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T cell lymphoma and new fever on 2 lpm O2 
 // ? PNA vs. pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT scan of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including widening
 of the upper mediastinum.
 
 There are increasing predominantly perihilar and right lower lobe opacities,
 possibly reflective of pulmonary edema.  Underlying infection cannot be
 excluded in the proper clinical context.  Airspace opacity in the left mid
 lung zone may correlate to the nodule described on the recent CT scan of the
 chest.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing perihilar and right lower lobe opacities which can be seen in the
 context of worsening pulmonary edema however superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded in the proper clinical context.
