                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with altered mental status and seizure.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Linear
 opacities projecting over right lung base likely represent atelectasis.  There
 is no right pleural effusion.  Left hemidiaphragm is obscured by overlying
 opacity, which may represent atelectasis or infection.  Left costophrenic
 angle is obscured, suggestive of trace pleural effusion.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The heart size is normal.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Partially imaged upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lung base opacity, likely atelectasis or infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting with possible trace left pleural effusion.
