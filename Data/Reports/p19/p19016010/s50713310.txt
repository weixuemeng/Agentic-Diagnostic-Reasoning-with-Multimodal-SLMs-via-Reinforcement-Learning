 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 3:24 PM
  1.  Unchanged left PICC position terminating at the estimated location of the
  cavoatrial junction.  This line may be retracted up to 2 cm to see if the
  patient's arrhythmia resolves.
  2.  Otherwise, normal radiograph of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient admitted with Aspergillus pneumonia, now with episodic
 NSVT.  Evaluate PICC position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The left PICC is unchanged in
 position from the prior radiograph and terminates at the approximate location
 of the cavoatrial junction.  However, given the patient's recent episodes of
 NSVT, the line may be retracted up to 2 cm to ensure that it is not in contact
 with the right atrium.
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The hilar
 and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged left PICC position terminating at the estimated location of the
 cavoatrial junction.  This line may be retracted up to 2 cm to see if the
 patient's arrhythmia resolves.
 2.  Otherwise, normal radiograph of the chest.
