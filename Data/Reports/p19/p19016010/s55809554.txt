                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ALL, seizures, unresponsive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the juxta-mediastinal
 right-sided opacities have partly resolved.  However, at the right lung base,
 the pre-existing parenchymal opacity is slightly more extensive than on the
 previous image.  These might be defect of lesser inspiratory effort than on
 the previous image.  However, short-term followup should be performed
 radiographically to exclude the possibility of developing pneumonia.  The left
 lung is unremarkable.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper
 range of normal, but no evidence of pulmonary edema is seen.
