                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AML status post bone marrow transplant.  Admitted with RSV
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The hazy opacifications on the right have resolved.  The right lung
 is now clear without consolidation.  At the left base, the previously seen
 opacification persists.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improvement in previously seen right-sided pneumonias.
 2.  Stable left opacification is likely a persistent pneumonia.
