                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with known pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there appears to be some increased
 engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevation in pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Again there is evidence of layering pleural effusion with
 compressive atelectasis at the right base.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
