                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of ALL and bone marrow transplant with known GVHD, CMV
 viremia, and fungal infection of the leg.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The trachea is deviated rightward secondary to an enlarged thyroid.
 Hazy opacities are seen in the right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and left
 lower lobe.  These appears similar to the opacities seen on the recent CT
 scan, and likely represent an atypical infection.  It does not appear to be
 worsening.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Multifocal pneumonia appears similar to recent CT scan and likely
 represents a viral or bacterial infection.  Would recommend serial chest
 radiographs until resolved.
 2.  Stable rightward tracheal deviation secondary to known enlarged thyroid.
