                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 worsening effusions or flash pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Position of previously
 described right-sided subclavian central venous line and left-sided PICC is
 unchanged.  As before, there is mediastinal shift towards the left hemithorax
 which now is completely opacified, demonstrating complete loss of aeration of
 the left lung.  This finding occurring in combination with left-sided
 mediastinal shift is highly suggestive of central airway obstruction which is
 probably accomplished by mucus plugs.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary
 infiltrates in the right lung; however, the vascular pattern suggests some
 degree of congestion with possible mild increase of pleural effusion, now
 partially obliterating the diaphragmatic contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complete opacification of left-sided hemithorax in the presence
 of mediastinal shift towards the left.  Clearing of central airways
 recommended.  Referring physician, ___ was paged at 4:45 p.m.
