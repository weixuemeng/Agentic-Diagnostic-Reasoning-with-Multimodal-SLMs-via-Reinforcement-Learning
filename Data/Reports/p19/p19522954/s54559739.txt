                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with left chest tube changed to waterseal, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained 7 hours earlier during the same day.  On this single frontal
 view examination the imaged field was directed more to the lower chest
 apparently requested.  This was the major concern of a localized small
 pneumothorax.  The apical area of the thorax is not included in the image
 field.  Thus, it is unclear whether the patient has been extubated or if the
 EGT has been pulled back to the neck region.  Previously described NG tube
 remains in position.  The upper left-sided chest tube again points towards the
 apical area, but the ultimate tip is cut off.  The lower positioned chest tube
 terminating at the level of the diaphragm remains in unchanged position and
 the low loculated small pneumothorax cavity has not changed in size
 significantly.  The right hemithorax remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of major pneumothorax.
