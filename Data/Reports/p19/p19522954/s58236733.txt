 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:46 PM
  2 left chest tubes appear in satisfactory position.  A linear hyperdensity
  within the left upper lung may reflect a soft tissue fold.  There are apparent
  lung markings traversing this, making a pneumothorax less likely.  Attention
  to this area on followup is recommended.  Postoperative changes are seen at
  the left hemidiaphragm.  There is a small left basilar pneumothorax.  No shift
  of the the mediastinum.  The ET tube and NG tube are in satisfactory position.
  Left chest wall subcutaneous air is noted.  Findings paged to Dr. ___ at
  22:46.
