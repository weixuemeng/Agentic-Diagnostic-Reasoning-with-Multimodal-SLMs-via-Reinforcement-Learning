                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:25 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 6:19 p.m.:
 
 Previous left lung collapse has nearly resolved, but there is persistent
 substantial left pleural effusion, not uncommon as a complication of
 unilateral lung or even lower lobe collapse.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 is slightly larger today.  It is difficult to detect concurrent mild
 interstitial edema, particularly in a patient with this severe emphysema.
 
 Heart size is probably not enlarged.  ET tube in standard placement.  Left PIC
 line ends alongside right subclavian line, low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
