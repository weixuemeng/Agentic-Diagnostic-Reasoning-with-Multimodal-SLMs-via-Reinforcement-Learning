                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, question
 mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Small,
 subtle opacity, measuring approximately 6 mm projecting over the posterior
 right 9th rib may be artifactual or summation of shadows/vascular structures,
 but small ground glass opacity from underlying infection can not be excluded. 
 No pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small, subtle opacity, measuring approximately 6 mm projecting
 over the posterior right 9th rib may be artifactual or summation of
 shadows/vascular structures, but small ground glass opacity from underlying
 infection can not be entirely excluded.  Recommend f/u chest radiograph to
 resolution to exclude an underlying nodule.  If clinical concern for pulmonary
 mass persists, CT is more sensitive for pulmonary nodules.
 
 Findings/recommendation submitted to the ED QA nurses on ___ at 8:25PM.
