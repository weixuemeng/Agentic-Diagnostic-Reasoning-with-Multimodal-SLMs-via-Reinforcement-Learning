                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, patient with history of bronchial
 adenoma.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___, and ___ CT.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinum is shifted towards the right as
 before.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  On the right, lateral
 costophrenic angle is blunted.  This is due to prior right lung resection.  A
 surgical chain projects in the right lower hemithorax.  Patient has known
 multiple tiny lung nodules and bronchiectasis throughout the lungs, better
 seen in prior CT.  Ill-defined linear opacities in the right upper lobe that
 correspond to loss of volume, bronchiectasis, and tiny lung nodules are
 unchanged from prior studies.
 Scarring in the left upper lobe is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
