                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for differences in technique.  A vague peripheral opacity projecting
 over the right lung apex also appears unchanged.  Streaky opacities in the
 right lower lobe are most consistent with minor atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis.  No
 convincing evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
