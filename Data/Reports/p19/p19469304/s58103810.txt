                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle due to prior lung resection.  Better seen on the prior
 study, there are chain sutures projecting over the right lower hemithorax. 
 The patient has known pulmonary nodules and bronchiectasis throughout the
 lungs, better seen on prior CT.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
 Overall, there has been no significant interval change since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since the prior study.  Chronic
 changes as above.
