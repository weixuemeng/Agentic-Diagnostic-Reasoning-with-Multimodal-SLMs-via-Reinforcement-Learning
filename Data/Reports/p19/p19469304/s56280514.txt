                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Evidence of volume loss in the right lung from prior
 right lower lobectomy and right middle lobe segmentectomy are re- demonstrated
 with slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures and elevation the right
 hemidiaphragm.  A small right pleural effusion may be slightly increased
 compared to the previous exam.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Streaky opacities are noted within the right upper lobe and left lung base,
 which appear to have slightly increased compared to the previous exam.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  The
 bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in small right pleural effusion.  Patchy opacities in
 the right upper lobe and left lung base may reflect areas of developing
 infection.
