                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hepatitis-C, sarcoidosis, and status post recent fall with
 right-sided reproducible chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.  A
 chest CT is also available from ___.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including a stable
 bulging contour to the right lateral mid peritracheal stripe suggesting
 lymphadenopathy, probably unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax, but there is new very mild right lateral pleural thickening. 
 The lungs appear clear.  The right lateral seventh rib shows a new contour
 irregularity with a sclerotic line suggesting interval fracture, otherwise
 age-indeterminant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight right lateral pleural thickening which may be seen after trauma
 inflammation or infection; new but not very striking.  Contour irregularity to
 the right lateral seventh rib, new since prior studies and consistent with a
 non-displaced fracture although otherwise of uncertain acuity.
