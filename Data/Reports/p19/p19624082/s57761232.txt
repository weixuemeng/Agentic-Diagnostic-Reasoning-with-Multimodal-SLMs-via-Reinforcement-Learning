 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with hemoperitoneum, central line placement. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter is in correct position and is unchanged.  The course of the
 catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the
 mid-to-lower SVC.  In the interval, the patient has been intubated.  The tip
 of the endotracheal tube projects 3.5 cm above the carina.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The lung volumes have decreased, newly appeared relatively severe atelectasis
 at the lung bases.  In addition, the presence of fluid overload cannot be
 excluded.  The mediastinum continues to be markedly enlarged, which is likely
 caused by enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes documented on the CT examination
 from ___.  However, close radiographic monitoring is required to
 exclude potential other causes for mediastinal widening, in particular aortic
 pathologies.  No pneumothorax.
