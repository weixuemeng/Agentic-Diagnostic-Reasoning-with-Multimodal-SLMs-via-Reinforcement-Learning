 PORTABLE CHEST ___ WITH COMPARISON ___ RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.  Persistent
 widening of right upper mediastinal contour, likely due to a combination of
 vascular distension and known mediastinal lymphadenopathy on recent CT of
 ___.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild edema.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with
 adjacent basilar lung opacities which may reflect atelectasis and/or
 infectious consolidation.  Diffuse haziness of imaged portion of upper abdomen
 suggests the possibility of ascites.
