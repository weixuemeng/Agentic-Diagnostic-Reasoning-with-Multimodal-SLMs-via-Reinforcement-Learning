  Orogastric tube terminates with side hole at the level of the GE junction
  which could be advanced 7 cm for more optimal positioning.  Internal jugular
  and endotracheal tubes are unchanged.  Lung volumes are low with persistent
  left greater than right basilar atelectasis.  Despite this, there is likely
  vascular congestion though this and potential mild edema appears improved.

 HISTORY:  OGT removed and replaced.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 orogastric tube is at the level of the GE junction and should be advanced at
 least 7 cm for better positioning.  Other monitoring and support devices
 remain in place.  Continued low lung volumes with bibasilar opacifications. 
 This most likely represents a combination of vascular congestion and
 atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
