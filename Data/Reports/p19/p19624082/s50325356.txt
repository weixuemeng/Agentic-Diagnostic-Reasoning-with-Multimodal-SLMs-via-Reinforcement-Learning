 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary sarcoid, followup of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  A pre-existing subtle opacity at
 the left upper lobe base has completely resolved.  At the middle parts of the
 right lung, there is unchanged evidence of minimal peribronchial thickening of
 unclear clinical significance.
 
 The lateral radiograph better shows than the frontal image a micronodular
 pattern extending at the lung bases in a bilateral fashion.
 
 There are no pleural effusions.  No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity
 suggesting recent pneumonia.
