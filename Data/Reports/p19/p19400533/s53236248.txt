                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The posterior costophrenic sulci are blunted with a meniscoid
 effect suggesting small pleural effusions which are likely bilateral, although
 more definitively demonstrated on the right side.  The pulmonary vascularity
 is mildly prominent suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.  Vague opacities
 in the left lower lobe are better seen on the lateral view.  Atelectasis or
 pneumonia could be considered for this appearance.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild cardiac enlargement is similar allowing for differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small pleural effusions and left lower lobe opacity, greater than
 right.  Mildly prominent vascularity suggesting slight congestion. 
 Atelectasis or potentially pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting regarding focal left lower lobe opacification.
