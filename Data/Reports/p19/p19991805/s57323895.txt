                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening oxygen requirement and hypernatremia.  History of
 dementia and recent pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including moderate
 cardiomegaly.  What is new is bilateral opacification of each lung base, which
 is especially confluent in the retrocardiac region on the left.  Particularly
 on the right, small coinciding pleural effusion is suspected.  Indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature appears mildly distended suggesting coinciding vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial opacities at both lung bases, raising concern for pneumonia. 
 Findings also suggest mild coinciding vascular congestion and possibly small
 pleural effusions.
