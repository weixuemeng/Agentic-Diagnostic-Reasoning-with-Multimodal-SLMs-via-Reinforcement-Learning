 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with coronary artery disease s/p CABG and PCI,
 congestive heart failure, and COPD/asthma who admitted with hypoxia and
 hypernatremia now with increased work of breathing. Growing MRSA in sputum but
 clinically without cough or fever to suggest PNA. Also has had diuretics held 
 // evaluate for pulmonary edema or PNA   evaluate for pulmonary edema or PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been increase in the
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
 Basilar opacifications are again consistent with small pleural effusions and
 atelectatic changes in this patient with stable enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.
