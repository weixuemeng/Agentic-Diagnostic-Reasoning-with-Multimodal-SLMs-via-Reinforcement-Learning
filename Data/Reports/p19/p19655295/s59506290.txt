                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and intermittent left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 diffuse mild interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 A more focal left upper lobe opacity has resolved and streaky left basilar
 opacities have also mostly resolved leaving what probably represents minor
 residual atelectasis.  Fissures are thickened with suspected small pleural
 effusions and patchy right basilar opacity again likely reflects atelectasis. 
 The left acromiohumeral interval is effaced suggesting rotator cuff pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 patchy atelectasis and suspected small pleural effusions with fissural fluid.
