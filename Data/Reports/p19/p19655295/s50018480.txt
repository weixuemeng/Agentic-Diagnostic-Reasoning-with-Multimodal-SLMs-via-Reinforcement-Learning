                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ as well as CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to most recent radiograph dated ___, there is improved
 aeration of the left lung.  However, persistent opacification and leftward
 mediastinal shift in addition to right lung hyperexpansion is consistent with
 left lung collapse.  There is increased opacity of the right lower lobe with
 obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.  While this may reflect atelectasis,
 infection cannot be excluded.   There is likely a small left pleural effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Redemonstration of anteriorly dislocated right
 shoulder as well as third and second right rib fractures, present previously.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent left lung collapse though better aerated.
 2. Right lower lung opacification which may reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.
 3.  Unchanged right anterior shoulder dislocation and multiple right sided
 chronic rib fractures.
