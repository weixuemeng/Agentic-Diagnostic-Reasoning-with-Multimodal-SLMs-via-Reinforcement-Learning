 grossly stable.  There is slight increase in obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm of the consistent with a pleural effusion and overlying
 atelectasis.  Left retrocardiac opacity could be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although consolidation is not excluded.

 dislocation of the right shoulder joint.
