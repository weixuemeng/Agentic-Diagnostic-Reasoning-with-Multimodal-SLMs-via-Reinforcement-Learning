                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, CHF, evaluate for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 CHEST 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the previous chest x-ray, there appears to be some mediastinal shift to
 the left. Some of this could be technical reasons due to rotation, but there
 is now an almost complete whiteout of the left chest probably indicating
 volume loss and a left effusion.  
 
 There is also an increase in the size of the right effusion and increased
 pulmonary plethora.  
 
 Overall, the appearances suggest worsening failure and volume loss in the left
 lung probably due to collapse of the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening failure, volume loss and mediastinal shift to the left.
