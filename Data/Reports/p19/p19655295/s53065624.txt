                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right-sided chest pain and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 opacities.  Although these likely contain a component of compressive
 atelectasis, infection cannot be excluded.  The right lower lung opacity
 projecting above the effusion demostrates a fluffy appearance more concerning
 for pneumonia or aspiration.  There has been interval near-complete resolution
 of the left perihilar opacity.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is
 difficult to evaluate in the setting of these overlying opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, which may
 represent aspiration or pneumonia, likely with a component of ateletasis.
