                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates decreased lung
 volumes, with interval increase in bibasilar opacities particulary on the
 right likely reflecting a combination of pleural effusions and adjacent
 atelectasis.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated, and the mediastinal contours again show calcification
 of the aortic knob and aortic tortuosity.  Healed left rib fractures are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Increased bilateral, particularly right sided pleural effusions with probable
 adjacent atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in the lower lobes.
