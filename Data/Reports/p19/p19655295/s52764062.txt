                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained, but evaluation is
 somewhat limited by patient rotation.  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly and
 extensive calcification of the thoracic aorta. Leftward shift of the
 mediastinum is similar in appearance to ___ and ___,
 possibly related to left volume loss.  There is persistent elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm. Right base atelectasis is also persistent.  A rounded
 retrocardiac opacity projecting posteriorly on lateral view is of unclear
 etiology.  No definite focal consolidation is identified.  Pleural fluid is
 seen within the fissure on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.  Chronic rib
 deformities are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Rounded mass- like opacity projecting over the posterior lung is of unclear
 etiology, and should be further evaluated with CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated recommendations were communicated via telephone by Dr.
