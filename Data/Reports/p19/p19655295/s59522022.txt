                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxia, assess for cause.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright of the chest provided.  Hemidiaphragm is elevated with
 left basal opacity, likely atelectasis vs. pneumonia. There is normal aeration
 of the right lung without definite signs of effusion.  There is a left apical
 cap, which could represent fluid along the left lung apex.  Heart size cannot
 be assessed.  Mediastinum is difficult to assess due to leftward patient
 rotation.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings as above with possibility of left lung base pneumonia
 not excluded.  Please correlate clinically.
