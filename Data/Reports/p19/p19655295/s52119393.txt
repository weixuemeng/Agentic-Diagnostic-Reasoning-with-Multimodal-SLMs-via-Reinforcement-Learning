                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic left lung atelectasis, hypoxia.  Evaluate for interval
 change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___ and CT of the chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight interval
 improvement in aeration of the right lung.  There is continued near complete
 opacification of the left hemi thorax, secondary to large pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis.  There is a small area of persistently aerated lung
 in the left upper thorax.  As before there is a moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion with some adjacent atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Note is
 made of a chronic right anterior shoulder dislocation, which is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval improvement in aeration of the right lung.  Continued near
 complete opacification of the left hemi thorax secondary to large pleural
 effusion and compressive atelectasis.
