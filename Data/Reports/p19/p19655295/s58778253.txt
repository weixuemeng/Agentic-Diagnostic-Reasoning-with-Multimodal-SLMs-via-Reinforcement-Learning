                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonia, COPD, CHF.  Evaluate left lower lobe pneumonia
 and collapse after treatment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate increasing
 density in the left hilus and volume loss in the left lung.  Additionally,
 there is increasing left-sided pleural effusion and atelectatic changes of the
 left lung.  Combined with the overinflation of the right lung, this represents
 worsening volume loss of the left lung compared to the prior radiographs.
 
 In the right lung, no pleural effusion, opacity, or pneumothorax is
 identified.
