                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with chronic left lower lobe pneumonia/collapse and bilateral
 effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to prior exam there has been improvement in left lower lobe collapse
 with greater aeration.  Additionally, there has been improvement in the left
 pleural effusion which remains moderate in size.  There has also been marked
 improvement of the right pleural effusion which is now minimal.  Fluid is seen
 tracking along the left major fissure on the lateral view.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Increased AP chest wall diameter is
 consistent with given history of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe
 collapse.
