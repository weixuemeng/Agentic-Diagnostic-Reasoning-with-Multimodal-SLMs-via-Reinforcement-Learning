  Persistent shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette to the left reflecting
  volume loss in the left mid and lower lung zones, with slightly better
  aeration at the left apex. Right pleural effusion and
  atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged. There is no evidence of worsening
  pulmonary edema.
