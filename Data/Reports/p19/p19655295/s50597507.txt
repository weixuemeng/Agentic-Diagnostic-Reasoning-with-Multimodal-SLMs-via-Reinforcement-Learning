 opacity inferiorly and is obscuring the left hilus and superior aspect of the
 aortic arch, which is suggestive of left upper lobe collapse. Increased
 homogeneous opacification of the left lower lobe with silhouting of the left
 hemidiaphram. Right lung is clear with little if any pleural fluid in the
 right lower lobe. No pneumothorax or bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe collapse with large left basal consolidation, and
 pleural effusion.
