                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tracheomalacia and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax, due to
 atelectasis/collapse of the left lung.  There is leftward deviation of the
 trachea, as before.  The right demonstrates slight interval worsening of
 linear basal atelectasis.  Chronic right humeral head dislocation is again
 noted, unchanged compared to the prior study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Atelectasis/collapse of the left lung.  Right basilar atelectasis
 is sligtly worse.  Chest phsyiotherapy and bronchoscopy is recommended. 
 Chronic right humeral head dislocation.
