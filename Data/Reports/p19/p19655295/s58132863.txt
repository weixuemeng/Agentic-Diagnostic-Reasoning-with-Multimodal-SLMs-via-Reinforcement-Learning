                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacification of the left lung with leftward mediastinal shift is
 suggestive of increased left lung collapse from prior exam. Opacity of the
 right lung base could represent atelectasis, however cannot exclude pneumonia
 or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Along the lateral border of the
 right lung, there is again seen a fluid collection adjacent to several rib
 fractures which are more displaced than on prior exam. This fluid collection
 is larger than on prior exam and likely reflect ongoing bleeding into the
 extra-pleural space. There is increased right pleural effusion from prior
 exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be well evaluated due to
 collapse of left lung. Right anterior shoulder dislocation and multiple
 right-sided chronic rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increases fluid collection along the lateral aspect of the right lung
 adjacent to several rib fractures which are more displaced than on prior exam,
 likely representing ongoing bleeding into the extrapleural space.
 
 2.  Interval increase in collapse of the left lung.
 
 3.  Opacity in the right lung base, which could represent atelectasis but
 cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings communicated to the___ medical team at 10:50
 a.m. on ___ by phone.
