                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory distress and left lung
 collapse, question interval change.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Compared with ___, the rounded area of lucency/aerated lung in the left
 upper zone laterally has decreased in size.  There is now near-complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax, with apparent leftward shift of the
 mediastinum.  The right lung remains grossly clear, allowing for atelectasis
 and possible small amount of pleural fluid at the right lung base.  
 
 The right humeral head is again seen to be dislocated, as indicated on
 shoulder radiographs from ___.  In addition, the most recent prior films
 shows findings consistent with a chronic rotator cuff tear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with apparent
 shift of the mediastinum to the left, even allowing for slight oblique patient
 positioning.  The small amount of aerated left lung has decreased compared
 with the prior film.
