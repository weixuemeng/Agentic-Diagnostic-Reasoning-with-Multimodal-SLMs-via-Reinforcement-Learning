 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since ___, mild cardiomegaly, an otherwise normal mediastinum are
 stable, and small layering pleural effusions are stable, but mild pulmonary
 edema is worse. Bilateral lower lung opacification has increased.  Whether
 this is dependent edema and atelectasis alone, or hides pneumonia is
 radiographically indeterminate. There is no pneumothorax.
