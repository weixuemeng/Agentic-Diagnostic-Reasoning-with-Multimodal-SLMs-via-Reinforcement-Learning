                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea  // acute intrathoracic process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is cardiomegaly with a calcified, unfolded aorta ; small left effusion with
 increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation; patchy opacity
 at the right base with a small right effusio; and upper zone redistribution,
 without other evidence of CHF.  There is background hyperinflation suggestive
 of COPD.
 
 There is deformity of some of the right upper ribs consistent with old rib
 fractures.  As before, the there is anterior dislocation of the right humeral
 head with respect to the glenoid .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Doubt significant change compared with ___.  No definite acute
 superimposed process.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to the prior film.
 3. Small left-greater-than-right effusions, with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidations and patchy opacity at the right base, unchanged.
 4. COPD and old thoracic deformity again noted.
 5. Anterior dislocation of the right shoulder again noted.
