                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever, history of congestive heart failure and COPD,
 question pneumonia.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 There is new left perihilar opacity worrisome for infectious process.  Right
 lower lobe opacity although present on the prior study is slightly more
 prominent and might reflect infectious process as well.
 
 On the other hand there is interval improvement of the left lower lobe
 consolidation with currently only minimal atelectasis and small effusion
 present.
 
 Lateral view demonstrates a consolidation most likely in the lingular process
 with left lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidations are still of
 concern.
 
 Followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy
 is recommended.
 
 Mild volume overload is noted but no overt edema is seen.
