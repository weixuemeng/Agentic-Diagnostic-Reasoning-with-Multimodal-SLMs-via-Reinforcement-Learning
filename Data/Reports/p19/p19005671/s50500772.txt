                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with progressive MM  // re-evaluate pleural
 effusions. L TPC in place
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, a left pleural catheter remains in
 place with slight decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion. 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion appears slightly larger, but
 positional differences between the exams limit comparison as this effusion was
 partially layering on the previous semi upright study.
