                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumo post R pleurex placement  // evaluate
 pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC.  Bilateral chest tubes are
 unchanged in position.  There has been interval decrease in cardiomegaly. 
 Mediastinal congestion has improved.  Focal consolidation at the right lung
 base obscuring the right heart border reflects atelectasis versus pneumonia,
 better evaluated on most recent chest CT.  A small right pleural effusion
 persists.  Partial collapse of the left lower lobe and moderate left pleural
 effusion better evaluated on most recent chest CT.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2. Cardiomegaly and mediastinal congestion have improved.
 3. Consolidation in the right lower lobe better evaluated on most recent chest
 CT likely reflects pneumonia versus atelectasis.
 4.  Partial collapse of the left lower lobe and moderate left pleural effusion
 better evaluated on most recent chest CT.
