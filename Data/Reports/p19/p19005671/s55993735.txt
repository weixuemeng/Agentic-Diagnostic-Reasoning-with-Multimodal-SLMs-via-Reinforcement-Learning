                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right chest tube placement.  Evaluate
 pigtail placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from earlier on the same day, ___, 12:26.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest drain has been placed in the interim, projecting over the right
 mid hemithorax just under the superior aspect of the opacity that likely
 pleural effusion.  The tip of the catheters straight and does not have the
 "pigtail appearance.  No significant subcutaneous emphysema.  Mottled
 appearance of the bones is consistent with history of multiple myeloma with
 bilateral chronic rib deformities likely old pathologic fractures.  No
 significant change in bilateral large right and moderate left pleural
 effusions.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size cannot be assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of right chest drain with tip projecting over the
 mid-upper hemithorax, just below the uppermost aspect of the effusion without
 typical pig-tail configuration.  The position of this drain may be inadequate
 to clear the pleural effusion.
 
 2.  No change otherwise.
