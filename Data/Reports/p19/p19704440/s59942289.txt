                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Heterogeneous opacity at the left
 lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is upper limits of normal
 allowing for lung volumes.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Degenerative change is seen at the
 acromioclavicular joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia. Follow up radiographs after treatment
 are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
