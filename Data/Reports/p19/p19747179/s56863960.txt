                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 hyperexpanded and there is mild flattening of the diaphragms, consistent with
 known diagnosis of COPD.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Tiny dense nodule in the right lung base likely represents a
 calcified granuloma versus a vessel on end.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
