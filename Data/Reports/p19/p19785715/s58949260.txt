  Improved bibasilar opacities, however subtle basilar opacities persist and
  these could be due to aspiration, underlying emphysema or an underlying
  infectious process. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for
  further evaluation. If concern for a pulmonary lesion, however, a non urgent
  chest CT would be more sensitive.

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and cervical spine CT
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  As compared to prior chest radiograph from
 ___, there has been interval improvement of bibasilar opacities. 
 However, subtle basilar opacities persist and may be due to aspiration,
 underlying emphysema,  underlying infectious process is not entirely excluded.
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved bibasilar opacities, however subtle basilar opacities
 persists and these could be due to aspiration, underlying emphysema,

 would be helpful for further evaluation. If concern for a pulmonary lesion, a
 non urgent chest CT would be more sensitive.
