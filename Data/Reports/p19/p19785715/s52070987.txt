 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.

 including the superior to inferior rows as well as the second inferior more

 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.

 patchy opacity at the lateral left upper lobe, which could also be related to
 infection.
