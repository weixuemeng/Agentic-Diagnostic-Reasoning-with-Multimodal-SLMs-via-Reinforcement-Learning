                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  Vascular stent is noted within the right subclavian artery.  Heart
 size is normal. Coronary arterial vascular stent is also demonstrated. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  There is hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of the
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices, compatible with emphysema. 
 Minimal interstitial opacities are seen predominantly within the lung bases,
 likely reflecting chronic changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.  Degenerative spurring is also noted within the right
 acromioclavicular joint.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema with chronic interstitial changes, but no evidence for
 pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
