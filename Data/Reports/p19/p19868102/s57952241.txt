                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fatigue, known lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with evidence of prior left upper lobectomy and volume loss in the
 left lung.  The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again
 demonstrated.  Focal patchy opacity in the right upper lobe was present on the
 prior CT from ___, and may reflect persistent or residual
 pneumonia.  Additional previously noted areas concerning for early
 adenocarcinoma on prior CT particularly within the right lower lobe are not
 well seen on the current radiograph.  No new areas of new focal consolidation
 are present.  There is no new pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
 edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent patchy opacity in the right upper lobe, which was present on the
 prior CT, and may reflect persistent or residual pneumonia.
 
 2. Emphysema.
 
 3. Other areas of potential early adenocarcinoma within particularly the right
 lower lobe are better assessed on the previous CT.
