                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hemoptysis  // ? increase in size of
 opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal interstitial pulmonary abnormality is chronic. There is no focal lung
 lesion, or any indication location of the bleeding source. CT scanning would
 be required for that determination. Hyperinflation suggests COPD. Heart size
 is normal. Scarring is probably responsible for chronic blunting of the left
 lateral pleural sulcus. Left hilus is mildly elevated, but I do not see
 scarring in the left upper lobe.
 
 Moderate scoliosis is in the thoracic spine is chronic.
