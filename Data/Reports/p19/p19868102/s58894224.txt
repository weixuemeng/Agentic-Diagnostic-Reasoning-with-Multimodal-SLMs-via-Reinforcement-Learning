                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer, pneumonia, persistent cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pneumonia
 has substantially decreased in extent and severity and is barely visible on
 today's image.  Moderate-to-severe overinflation persists.  Moderate scoliosis
 of the thoracic spine, causing asymmetry of the rib cage.  Minimal exclusively
 dorsal pleural effusions persist.  No new focal parenchymal opacities are
 visible.
