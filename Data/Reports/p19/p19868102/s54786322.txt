                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weakness and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Although on the frontal view the right lung base is unchanged,
 on the lateral there is slightly increased opacity in the retrocardiac region.
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Superior retraction of the left
 hilum with surgical chain sutures in the suprahilar region are again seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:    Better seen on the lateral view is slightly increased opacity
 in the retrocardiac region, potentially could be infectious, and followup will
 be necessary given patient's history.
