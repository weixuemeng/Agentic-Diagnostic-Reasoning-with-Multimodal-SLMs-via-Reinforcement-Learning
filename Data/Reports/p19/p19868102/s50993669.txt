                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration one week previously, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms is again seen consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.
