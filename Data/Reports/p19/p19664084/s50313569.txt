                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  No focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
 is noted.  There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could
 suggest a trace pleural effusion or chronic pleural thickening.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect a trace pleural effusion
 versus chronic pleural thickening. Hyperinflated lungs, which can be seen with
 asthma.
