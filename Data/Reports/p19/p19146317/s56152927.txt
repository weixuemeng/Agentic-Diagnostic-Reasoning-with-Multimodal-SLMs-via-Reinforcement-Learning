  IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload.  New nodular densities
  projecting over the right lung for which a CT evaluation is suggested when
  clinically appropriate since these may represent new lung nodules in the
  setting of known prior malignancy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Renal failure.  History of colon cancer.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a Port-A-Cath terminating in the cavoatrial junction.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is mild central pulmonary vascular
 prominence as well as indistinctness in upper zone redistribution suggesting
 mild fluid overload.  There is a nodular opacity projecting over the right
 lower lung.  An additional one also projects near the site of a Port-A-Cath
 device in the right mid abdomen.  The possibility that these may reflect
 metastatic disease should be considered.
