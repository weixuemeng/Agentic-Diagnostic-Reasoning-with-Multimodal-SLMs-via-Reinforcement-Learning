                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Palpitations, question pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Fusion hardware
 is partially imaged in the lower C-spine.  The lungs appear clear without
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear
 hyperinflated which likely reflects underlying COPD.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the chest.
