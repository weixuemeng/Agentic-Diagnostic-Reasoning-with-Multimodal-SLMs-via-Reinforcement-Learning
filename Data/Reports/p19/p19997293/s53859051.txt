 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Spinal abscess, stage IV COPD, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and postoperative clips have been removed.
 
 The basal parts of both lungs are missing on the image, left more than right. 
 The visible parts of the lung parenchyma are unchanged and without evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  The presence of small pleural effusions,
 however, cannot be excluded.
 
 Unchanged left-sided PICC line, unchanged vertebral stabilization devices and
 sternal wires.
