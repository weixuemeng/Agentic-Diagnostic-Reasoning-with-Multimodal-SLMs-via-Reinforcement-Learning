                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Arrest with CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued evidence of
 vascular congestion with hazy opacification at the bases consistent with
 bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The
 difference in appearance may merely reflect the changes in patient position,
 with the patient more supine on the current study.  Endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  There is now a left subclavian catheter
 that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.  Single-channel pacemaker device
 remains in place.  Extensive spinal surgery is again evident.
