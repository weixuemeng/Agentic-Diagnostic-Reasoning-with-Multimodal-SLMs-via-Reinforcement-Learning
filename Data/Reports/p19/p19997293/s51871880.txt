 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 23:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with epidural abscess status post surgical
 drain, placement of PICC line and endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 23:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  A left PICC line is
 seen coursing at least to the level of the distal brachiocephalic vein near
 the junction with the SVC, but due to overlying spinal hardware, cannot be
 visualized any further.  This wet reading was provided to ___ by
 phone at 11:47 a.m. on ___ by Dr. ___.  The patient is status
 post median sternotomy for CABG.  There has been interval appearance of the
 spinal hardware and interval appearance of a catheter projecting over the left
 mid chest.  Patchy opacity at the right base may represent partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There appears to be a layering left effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
