                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Single-chamber pacemaker insertion.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker was inserted with the leads terminating over the
 expected location of the left ventricle.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  Right basal consolidation is redemonstrated.  No pneumothorax or
 interval development of new consolidation is seen.  Small amount of right
 pleural effusion is better appreciated on the lateral view.  The spinal
 hardware is unchanged in appearance.
