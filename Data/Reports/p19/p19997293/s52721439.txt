                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status; question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.  The patient is
 status post fusion of the lumbar spine and sternotomy.  The base of the chest
 is not completely included, but cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Hazy opacification projecting over the lower lungs suggests
 persistent pleural effusions.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear, however. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with persistent substantial pleural effusions
 on limited examination.
