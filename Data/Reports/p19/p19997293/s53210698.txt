                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 12:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with orogastric tube and PICC line, check
 location.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 23:17.
 
 Single AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 12:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A left subclavian PICC line is seen with its tip in the mid superior vena
 cava.  ___ was notified of this by Dr. ___ by phone at 2:53 p.m.
 on ___.  The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position.  A nasogastric
 tube is in position, although the mid portion of the tube is difficult to see,
 but the tip does course below the diaphragm and projects over the expected
 location the stomach.  There is a catheter again seen overlying the left mid
 chest, probably relating to a surgical drain in this patient status post
 spinal surgery with hardware overlying the thoracic spine.  There has been a
 median sternotomy.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given marked patient rotation to the right on the current examination. 
 Small layering bilateral effusions with associated patchy atelectasis. 
 Bibasilar pneumonia would be less likely.  No pneumothorax is seen.
