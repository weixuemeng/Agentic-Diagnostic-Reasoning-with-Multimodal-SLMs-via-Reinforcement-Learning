                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, epidural abscess, question pneumothorax, aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Lung apices slightly obscured due to the patient's neck and chin.  However, I
 doubt pneumothorax.  There are bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation,  similar to ___ or possibly very slightly worse. 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora, likely with
 an element of interstitial edema, slightly worse compared with ___.  
 
 A left-sided line is present, tip not optimally visualized, but likely
 overlying the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with interstitial edema.  Bilateral effusions and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, all probably slightly worse compared with
 ___.  Doubt pneumothorax.
