 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  V-fib arrest.  Check ET tube.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 6 cm above the carina.  There is an NG tube, but the
 tip is not adequately visualized to assess for appropriate position.  There is
 increased opacity at both bases, which could be due to volume loss or early
 infiltrate.  Spinal fixation device and sternal wires are visualized.
