                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Spinal abscess, respiratory failure, complete heart block,
 assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The
 patient is intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube poorly visualized. 
 The NG tube courses inferiorly though the tip is not clearly visualized. Left
 upper extremity PIC line is in unchanged and appropriate position.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and spinal fixation hardware again noted with skin ___
 along the body wall.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 opacities which could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia, or a
 combination.  The mid upper lungs appear well aerated.  Overall, heart size is
 difficult to assess due to patient rotation, though appears grossly unchanged.
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions appear slightly increased with
 associated lower lung opacities which could represent atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.
