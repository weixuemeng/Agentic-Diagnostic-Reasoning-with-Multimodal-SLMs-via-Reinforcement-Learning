                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with 36 hours anuria.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted, most
 pronounced in the lung apices. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged without evidence for pulmonary edema.  Known esophageal malignancy
 is better assessed on the prior CT. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect aspiration, atelectasis or infection. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities could reflect aspiration, atelectasis or infection.
 Severe emphysema. Known esophageal malignancy better assessed on prior CT.
