                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  An additional radiograph centered lower in the abdomen has been
 provided for review.  It demonstrates the tip of the feeding tube in the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dobbhoff tube continues to terminate below the diaphragm.  Although
 the tip is not included on the radiograph, the tube extends at least into the
 duodenum.  Within the imaged portion of the chest, cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  Previously reported
 interstitial edema has cleared, and there has also been improvement in the
 extent of bibasilar atelectasis.
