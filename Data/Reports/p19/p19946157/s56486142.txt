                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:44 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, nausea, and hypotension.  Cirrhosis and
 hemochromatosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, accompanied
 by increase in heart size, still top normal.  Mediastinal veins are also
 dilated and suggest there may be a component of volume overload rather than
 cardiac decompensation.  Right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the
 right atrium.  Left jugular line tip is just below the level of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of view. 
 Small left pleural effusion is presumed.  No pneumothorax.
