                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 07:45
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with asthma and hypoxia, assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:24.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 7:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The patient is markedly rotated to her right, limiting assessment of the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours, although they appear to be unchanged. 
 However, despite rotation, there is some shift of the mediastinal structures
 to the right suggesting volume loss within the right lung which has likely not
 significantly changed.  The left lung is grossly clear.  Vasculature is
 cephalized consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  No pneumothorax.  No large effusions.  Multiple
 surgical clips in the epigastric region are again noted.
