                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with wheezing and sputum production.  Evaluation
 for infection.  Review of the___ medical record reveals further history of
 transposition of the great vessels, status post repair at age ___, with
 longstanding asthma.  Prior history of gastroesophageal hernia repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded, with no evidence of pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Coarse interstitial markings are
 noted bilaterally.  The mediastinum is shifted towards the right, likely due
 to known history of transposition of the great vessels, status post repair. 
 Multiple surgical clips are noted in the left upper quadrant, presumably from
 prior gastroesophageal hernia repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Interstitial opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis or
 chronic changes.
