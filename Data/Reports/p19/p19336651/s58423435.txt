                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PTX, chest tube technical failure with

 suction.  // PTX size
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to approximately 1.5 hr earlier, no gross interval change is
 detected. The right lung apex pneumothorax is again seen, similar to the prior
 study. A catheter at the right lung base is again noted. The right PICC line
 tip overlies the mid/ distal SVC, probably unchanged. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and diffuse opacities are also grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged.
