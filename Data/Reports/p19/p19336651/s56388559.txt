                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the most recent prior chest radiograph, there has been no
 relevant interval change. Re-demonstrated is a diffuse infiltrative pulmonary
 process, in addition to moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema, that has slightly progressed. There is a small left pleural
 effusion and probable small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 The heart remains mildly enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are intact and
 well-aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Progression  of a diffuse infiltrative pulmonary process, largely
 unchanged from ___, with some increase in pulmonary edema perhaps.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly, moderate pulmonary vascular congestion/edema, and small
 bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, also unchanged.
