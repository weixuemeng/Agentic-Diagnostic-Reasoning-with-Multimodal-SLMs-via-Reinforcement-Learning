                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleurX that became disconnected c/f air
 entrainment.  // assess for PTX      assess for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax or change in the appearance of probable small residual right
 pleural effusion 05:00 today. PleurX catheter unchanged in intrathoracic
 course.  Moderate left pleural effusion stable. Heart is top-normal size but
 pulmonary vasculature is engorged and some of the diffuse interstitial
 abnormality is probably acute edema. Nevertheless the remainder of the Severe
 infiltrative pulmonary abnormality and particularly right upper lobe
 consolidation are long-standing and raise the question of pulmonary drug
 toxicity.
