                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the right base.  The configuration suggests atelectasis,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting a supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.  On the left, there is again opacification at the base with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 No definite vascular congestion.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube
 remain in unchanged position.
