 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after motor vehicle
 collision with skull fracture, followup.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is resolution of the previously
 seen left lower lobe atelectasis almost entirely.  Still present bibasal
 linear opacities are consistent with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pulmonary edema seen.
