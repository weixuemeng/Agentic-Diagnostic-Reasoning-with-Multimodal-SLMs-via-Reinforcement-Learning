                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, confusion and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is new patchy opacity involving
 the superior segment of the left lower lobe and probably also the left upper
 lobe to a lesser degree.  Minimal streaky opacification also projects over the
 right upper lobe.  These findings suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities suggesting pneumonia, particularly within the left
 lower lobe including retrocardiac opacification.  Within eight weeks,
 following treatment, follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution.
