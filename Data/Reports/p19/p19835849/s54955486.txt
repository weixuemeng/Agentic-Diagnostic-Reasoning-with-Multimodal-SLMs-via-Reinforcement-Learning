                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has slightly changed in
 distribution since the prior study, but is probably similar in size.  Within
 the left hemithorax, there is worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region, which could relate to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Small adjacent
 pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.  Known bilateral pulmonary
 nodules are seen to better detail on recent CT of the chest of ___.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
