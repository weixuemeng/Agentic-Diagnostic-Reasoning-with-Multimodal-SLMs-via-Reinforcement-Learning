                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bladder cancer status post arrest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued mild to large layering pleural effusion on the right with
 compressive atelectasis.  Similar opacification at the left base consistent
 with atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  
 
 Known bilateral pulmonary nodules are seen in better detail on the recent CT
 scan.
