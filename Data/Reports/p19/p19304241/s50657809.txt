                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.  Developing
 infection, however, is not completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
