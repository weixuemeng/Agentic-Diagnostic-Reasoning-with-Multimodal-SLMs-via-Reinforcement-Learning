 failure, HIV, worsening dyspnea on exertion over the last month.

 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal
 patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis though infection
 is not completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection is
 not completely excluded.
