  Mild pulmonary edema. Increased size of the cardiac silhouette compared to
  prior raises the possibility worsening cardiomegaly versus underlying
  pericardial effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CP, hypotension.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is similar compared to ___ the larger when compared to
 more recent prior from ___.  Compared to ___, there is mild
 increase in pulmonary vasculature and enlargement of the bilateral hilar and
 mediastinal silhouette, which may be secondary to increased pulmonary
 pressure.  There is minimal amount of fluid tracking in the minor fissure.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Increased size of the cardiac silhouette compared to
 prior raises the possibility worsening cardiomegaly versus underlying
 pericardial effusion.
