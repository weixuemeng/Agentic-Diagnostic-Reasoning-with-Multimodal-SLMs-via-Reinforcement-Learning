                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MR, CHF, IABP in place  // Interval change
 in pulmonary edema? Placement of IABP?      Interval change in pulmonary
 edema? Placement of IABP?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.  The
 monitoring and support devices are stable.  Continued substantial enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with minimal elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
 Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with some volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
 The area of increased opacification in the right upper lobe, worrisome for
 superimposed infection, may be slightly improved from the previous study.
