                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with wide open MR with worsening SOB  //
 worsening pulm edema/effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pectoral pacemaker and its leads are in unchanged positions.  There is
 new left lung base opacity in the retrocardiac region, likely reflecting left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Right lung base atelectasis is increased. New opacity in the right upper lung
 may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Moderately enlarged cardiac
 silhouette is similar to before.  Focal deformity at the right first rib is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right upper lung opacity may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema in
 setting of acute mitral valve regurgitation, however pneumonia or hemorrhage
 is possible in correct clinical setting.
 2. Increased bibasilar atelectasis small pleural effusions.
