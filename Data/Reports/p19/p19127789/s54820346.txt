                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiac enlargement is again demonstrated.  A left-sided AICD is again
 noted with leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar and there is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear opacity in the right lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Linear opacities within the right mid lung field
 are chronic, and likely reflect areas of scarring.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Chronic deformity of the right
 first rib is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
