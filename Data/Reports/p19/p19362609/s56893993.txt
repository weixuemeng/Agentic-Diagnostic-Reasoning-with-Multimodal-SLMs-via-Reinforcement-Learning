                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, recent lung mass removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Please note that prior studies for this patient are
 under a different medical record number, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Post-surgical
 changes are again seen. Right apical air cavity is stable to possibly
 minimally decreased. Right basilar opacity is seen, similar to prior, with
 grossly stable to possibly very minimally increased right pleural fluid. 
 There may also be mild increase in atelectasis.  Surgical clips are noted in
 the right hilar and mediastinal regions as well as in the right lung apex. 
 There is mild left basilar atelectasis without new focal consolidation in the
 left lung.  No left pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable examination with possible slight decrease in size
 of right apical air cavity, mildly increased right basilar atelectasis, and
 possible very slight increase in right pleural effusion.
