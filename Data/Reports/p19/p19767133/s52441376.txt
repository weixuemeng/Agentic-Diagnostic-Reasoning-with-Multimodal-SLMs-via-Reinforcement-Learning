                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with productive cough.  Question infection or CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 On two frontal views of the chest, the upper portion of the right heart border
 is partially obscured.  On ___, this was clear, and is therefore
 concerning for pneumonia even though the findings on the lateral view are
 somewhat equivocal.  If this is not pneumonia, it is due to chronic
 atelectasis or recurrent pneumonia in the right middle lobe since the right
 heart border was also obscured on ___.  I would recommend CT
 scanning to evaluate the bronchial airways.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 If the patient declines CT scanning, I would repeat chest radiograph in no
 more than four weeks in hopes of documenting clearing of the right middle
 lobe.  Dr. ___ was paged at 5:10 p.m. as soon as the findings were
 recognized and we discussed the findings by telephone 2 minutes later.
