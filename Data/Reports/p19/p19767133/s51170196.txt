                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sob, cp  // r/o pna, pulm edema      r/o
 pna, pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged since ___, but substantially increased
 since ___.  There is however minimal pulmonary vascular congestion, no
 edema, and no appreciable pleural effusion.  A nearly 2 cm wide elliptical
 opacity projecting to the left of the cardiac apex is more obvious today than
 it was on ___ have and new since ___.  Presumably this is
 atelectasis, but I would re-evaluate with conventional chest radiographs and
 perform CT scanning if the abnormality is not clearly insignificant.
 
 Healed fracture, posterolateral left middle rib.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs to consider advisability of
 chest CT.
