                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing dyspnea on exertion with history of asthma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Heart size is normal, and unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  There are linear opacities within the left lung base which are
 unchanged, likely reflective of scarring or atelectasis.  Suture material is
 seen projecting over the right upper/mid lung field.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine along with S-shaped scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
