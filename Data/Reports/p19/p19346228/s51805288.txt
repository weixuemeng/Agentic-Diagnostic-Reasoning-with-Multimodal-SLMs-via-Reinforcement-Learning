                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 is left base atelectasis/scarring, seen on studies dating back to ___. 
 No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base/lingular somewhat linear opacity most likely
 represents atelectasis/scarring.  However, if the patient has been treated for
 underlying pneumonia since the prior study, consider chest CT for further
 evaluation for confirmation, as question early pneumonia has been raised in
 the past in this location.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
