                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle right upper lobe patchy opacity in one to two locations which could
 represent pneumonia.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacities projecting over the right upper lung may
 raises concern for infection.  Recommend followup to resolution.
