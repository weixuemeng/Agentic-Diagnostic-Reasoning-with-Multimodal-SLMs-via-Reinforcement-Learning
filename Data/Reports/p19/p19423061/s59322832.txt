                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SBO s/p whipple in ___ and appy in ___  //
 Eval Port-a-cath placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent ___ radiograph from ___ and ___. Interval outside chest CT and radiographs noted.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath is in place, with tip over distal SVC.
 
 There is background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged. Mild aortic calcification noted.
 
 There is slight blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle, consistent with a
 small amount of pleural fluid or thickening. On the lateral view, there is
 suggestion of focal nodular density in the lower lobe posteriorly on 1 side.
 Additional patchy density projects over the cardiac silhouette. Indistinct
 opacities are seen laterally in both right and left lower zones. These small
 opacities likely correspond to opacities seen on the ___ chest CT.
 
 No CHF or large consolidation is identified. Oral contrast is noted within the
 bowel.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Port-A-Cath tip over distal SVC.
 2. Bibasilar focal opacities, likely corresponding to opacity seen on an
 outside the ___ chest CT. Correlation with clinical history is
 requested for further assessment.
 3. Small right effusion.
