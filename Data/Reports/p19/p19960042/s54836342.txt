 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:11 AM
  A rounded retrocardiac opacity has somewhat distinct borders.  This could

  cannot be excluded and a chest CT could be considered for further
  characterization.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A rounded retrocardiac opacity is not well seen on the AP view but likely
 reflects a hiatus hernia.  This would be an atypical appearance for pneumonia
 but further characterization with CT may be helpful.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is otherwise normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Borderline loss of vertebral body height in 2 of the mid thoracic vertebrae
 are likely within the range for normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A rounded retrocardiac opacity has somewhat distinct borders and may represent
 a hiatus hernia or an atypical appearance for pneumonia, however a more focal
 lesion cannot be excluded.  CT chest may be helpful to clarify, alternatively
 followup with repeat chest radiograph in ___ weeks following completion of
 treatment to re-evaluate would be recommended.
