                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged lack of
 evidence for pneumonia.  However, the frontal radiograph confirms presence of
 a rounded opacity in the right upper lobe that, as detailed in the previous
 report, should be worked up with CT to exclude a potential neoplasm.
 
 No pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly.
