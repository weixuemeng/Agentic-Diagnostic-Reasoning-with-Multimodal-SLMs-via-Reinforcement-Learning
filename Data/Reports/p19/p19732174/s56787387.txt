                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal view of the chest demonstrate persistent opacity in the right upper
 lobe.  There is a heterogeneous opacity in the right medial lung base, which
 appears slightly more conspicuous since prior.  There are prominent
 interstitial lung markings, which may reflect underlying interstitial edema. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent right upper lobe opacity.  Heterogeneous right lung base opacity is
 slightly more conspicuous since prior, which may reflect multifocal pneumonia.
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful if/when patient able.
