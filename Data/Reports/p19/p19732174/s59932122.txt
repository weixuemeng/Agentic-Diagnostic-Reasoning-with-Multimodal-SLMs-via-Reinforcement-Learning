                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single AP portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Right upper lung
 opacity is slightly more evident than on the previous examination.  Otherwise
 the lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt edema.  Linear
 retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in size with tortuous thoracic
 aortic contour.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent right upper lobe opacity could be due to recurrent or
 residual infectious process though neoplastic entities are not excluded.  As
 such, followup chest CT as recommended on the previous chest CT in 2 months is
 recommended after appropriate antibiotic therapy.
