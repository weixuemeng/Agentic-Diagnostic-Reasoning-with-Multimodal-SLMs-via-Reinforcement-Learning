                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Possible stroke.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:    The heart appears borderline enlarged.  In addition to
 calcification, there is moderate unfolding along the thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent centrally as well as the
 interstitium, suggesting very mild fluid overload.  The right hemidiaphragm
 shows mild-to-moderate elevation.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized to some extent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  No definite
 evidence for pneumonia or aspiration.
