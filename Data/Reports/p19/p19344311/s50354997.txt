                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Small bowel resection, abdominal abscess, evaluation for
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has an
 endotracheal tube that projects 4 cm above the carina.  The image is
 technically limited and large parts of the right hemithorax are missing. 
 Again a left pleural effusion and areas of perihilar atelectasis and vascular
 engorgement are visualized.  The size of the cardiac silhouette appears to be
 unchanged.
