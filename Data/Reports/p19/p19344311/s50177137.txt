 moderate pulmonary edema with both interstitial and alveolar components, small
 bilateral pleural effusions, top normal heart size and mediastinal vein
 dilatation.  Interval increase in heterogeneous opacity in the right lower
 lobe.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Evolving right lower lobe pneumonia suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
