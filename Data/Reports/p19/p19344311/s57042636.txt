                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pulmonary edema, assess for
 improvement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 20:16.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged. 
 There has been some interval improvement in aeration throughout the lungs with
 persistent bilateral airspace process  relatively sparing the right mid lung. 
 There is improved aeration at the left base.  These findings likely reflect
 improving, but residual moderate pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infectious
 process should also be considered.  There continue to be layering bilateral
 effusions.  There is confluent opacification at the left base likely
 reflecting a component of lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contour is stable.  Severe degenerative changes of the
 right glenohumeral joint is again seen.
