                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Labored breathing, question aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 9:29 a.m.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, the ET tube has been removed.  Again seen is a
 right IJ central line with tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Again seen are prominent patchy opacities in both upper zones, bilateral
 effusions, and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The opacity at
 the right base has improved compared with the earlier film.  Opacity in the
 right upper and left upper zones is probably more confluent than on the
 earlier film.Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities in both lungs, which appear worse in both
 upper zones and slightly better at the right base compared with the prior
 film.  The differential includes multifocal pneumonia or other causes of
 alveolar infiltrates.  The possibility of associated superimposed aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
