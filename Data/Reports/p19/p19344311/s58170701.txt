                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CVA, now PEG placement, ET tube position.  Known aspiration risk.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 The ET tube lies approximately 9 mm above the carina, pointing towards the
 right mainstem bronchus.  This is new compared with the prior film dated
 ___.  The previously seen Dobbhoff tube has been removed.  The appearance
 on the earlier film suggested the presence of a hiatal hernia.  A right IJ
 central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  
 
 There are dense interstitial and confluent opacities throughout both lungs,
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and a layering left effusion. 
 The possibility of some right-sided pleural fluid cannot be excluded. 
 Incidental note made of severe right glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
 
 The pulmonary findings have progressed considerably compared with ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube tip 9 mm above the carina pointing towards the right mainstem
 bronchus.  Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction, approximately 1
 cm, is requested. (Please see subsequent CXR showing ETT has been removed.)
 
 2.  Patchy but diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities,
 considerably progressed compared with ___, with layering left effusion and
 continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  This could represent
 asymmetric CHF with pulmonary edema.  The possibility of infectious
 infiltrates should also be considered.  At least some of this could represent
 sequela of prior aspiration.
