                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina with
 the neck in a flexed position.  Central venous catheter terminates in the
 superior vena cava.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. 
 Widespread areas of consolidation are again demonstrated throughout both
 lungs, with slight interval improvement compared to the recent study.  There
 is relative sparing of the right mid lung region peripherally, with otherwise
 diffuse distribution.  Within the right upper lobe, there is mild associated
 volume loss with elevation of the minor fissure.  Observed findings probably
 represent a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed allowing for
 positional differences of the patient.
