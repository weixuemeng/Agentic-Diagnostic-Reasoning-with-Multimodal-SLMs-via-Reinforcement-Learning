                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Focal streaky opacities seen within the right hilar region
 as well as patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the right. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is clearly evident. 
 Extensive degenerative changes are noted involving both glenohumeral joints,
 more pronounced on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky right upper lobe opacity may reflect an area of infection or
 aspiration.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect areas of
 atelectasis, though additional areas of infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up imaging with radiographs are recommended and if
 there is persistence of these findings after treatment, CT is suggested.
