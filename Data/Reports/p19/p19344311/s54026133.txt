                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:23 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  New desaturation after mucus plugging causing atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema developed between ___, worsened appreciably
 between ___, quite likely with accompanying pneumonia or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  Since ___, decrease in mediastinal venous caliber
 and small right pleural effusion suggest improvement in hemodynamic balance,
 but there is still extensive edema and probably multifocal pneumonia,
 worsening in the right lower lobe.  Greater consolidation in the right upper
 lobe could be a function of atelectasis, but pneumonia should be considered in
 that location as well.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse is reflected in ipsilateral mediastinal shift, toward
 the uniformly opaque left lower lobe.
 
 No pneumothorax.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard
 placements and the nasogastric drainage tube ends in the distal stomach.
