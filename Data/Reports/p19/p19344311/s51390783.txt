                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 1:06 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 1:06 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain unchanged in
 position.  Lung volumes remain low with a diffuse reticulonodular interstitial
 abnormality and more confluent opacity at both bases and in the right upper
 lobe.  These findings are concerning for a diffuse infectious process. 
 Overall, the perihilar vasculature is slightly less prominent suggesting a
 component of resolving perihilar edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged given differences in positioning.  The patient's mandible
 obscures the lung apices.  There are severe degenerative changes of the right
 glenohumeral joint.  No pneumothorax.
