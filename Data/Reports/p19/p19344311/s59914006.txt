 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal improvement in ventilation at the left lung bases,
 potentially due to a partial resolution of a pre-existing left pleural
 effusion.  No other relevant change.  No change in size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  The monitoring and support devices are constant in position.
