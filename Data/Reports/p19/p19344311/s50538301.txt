                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with trach and tube feeds.  Evaluate for
 aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 1:06
 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing bibasilar opacities which would be concerning for aspiration or a
 worsening infectious process.  There is also a persistent diffuse
 reticulonodular interstitial abnormality which likely is not significantly
 changed.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right
 subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are in unchanged position.  Severe
 degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No large effusions, although there is some blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which could reflect a small effusion.
