                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe pneumonia per outside hospital records, mild
 non-productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided PICC line has been removed.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  On the lateral film, there is some increased
 opacity overlying the heart in the expected region of the right middle lobe
 that may represent the previously described right middle lobe infiltrate.  It
 is difficult without the outside films to assess for change in appearance. 
 There is volume loss seen in the right lower lung and mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung is clear.
