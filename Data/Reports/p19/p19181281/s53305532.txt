                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post left flank stab wounds and
 left pneumothorax.  Perform images in standing to assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  Heart size is
 unchanged and remains normal.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No mediastinal
 abnormalities are present.  Several linear densities on the left base and mild
 blunting of the pleural lateral sinus is present as before and coincides with
 the previously described local chest wall emphysema related to stab wounds and
 surgical repair.  The amount of chest wall emphysema present reaches up to the
 axillary area and appears to be stable in comparison with the next previous
 portable chest examination.  As before, some local strands of chest wall
 emphysema are overlying the apical area, but there is no conclusive evidence
 for any apical pneumothorax.  Thus, both lungs remain well aerated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Local stab wounds with small atelectasis on left base but no
 evidence of massive infiltrates, large pleural effusion or apical
 pneumothorax.
