                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:25 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with end-stage renal disease and lupus nephritis
 after renal transplant.  Pancreatitis and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs,
 ___:
 
 Extensive relatively homogeneous pulmonary opacification in the setting of
 chronic moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous
 engorgement is explained by edema.  On the other hand, this could be
 noncardiogenic, diffuse alveolar damage, with or without a component of
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. 
 No pneumothorax.
