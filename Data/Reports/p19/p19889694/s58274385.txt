                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatitis and new lung abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has substantially improved and may be
 responsible for residual opacification at the lung bases, but on the left, the
 asymmetry could be due alternatively to pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 still present and mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature engorged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
