                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and fever  // ?Pneumonia      ?Pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated due to COPD.  An extremely small region of
 peribronchial opacification in the left lower lung projecting lateral to the
 cardiac apex on the frontal view could be due to an early pneumonia.
 
 The heart is mildly to moderately enlarged, given the degree of pulmonary over
 inflation, and the upper lobe vessels are mildly dilated but there is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Moderate size gastric hiatus hernia is
 unchanged.
