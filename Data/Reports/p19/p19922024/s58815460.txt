 FINDINGS: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes are noted causing crowding of the central
 bronchovascular structures.  There are possible small left pleural effusion. 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is normal in size
 given the low lung volumes.  The bones are diffusely demineralized which
 limits assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible left pleural effusion.
