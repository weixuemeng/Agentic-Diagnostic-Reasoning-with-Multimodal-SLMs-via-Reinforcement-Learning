                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is minimal
 streaky opacity in the left lung base.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base.  This likely reflects
 atelectasis though developing infection cannot be completely excluded.
