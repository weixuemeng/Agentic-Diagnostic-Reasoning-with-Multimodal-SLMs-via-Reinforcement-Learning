                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  The gastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm,
 extending to the expected location of the stomach.  There are air distended
 loops of bowel not well evaluated on this study.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  A tortuous aorta is again seen, similar in appearance to the chest
 radiograph from ___.  Slight prominence of the ascending aorta may
 be technical and due to tortuosity, although mild dilatation of the ascending
 aorta is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the level of the diaphragm terminating in the
 expected location of the stomach.  Air distended portions of the
 gastrointestinal tract not well evaluated on this study. 
 
 Slight prominence of the ascending aorta may relate to tortuosity and
 technique, however, mild dilatation of the ascending aorta is not excluded on
 this study and could be further evaluated for with nonemergent CT.
