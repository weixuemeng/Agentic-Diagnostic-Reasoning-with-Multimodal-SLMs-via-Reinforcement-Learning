                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M from nursing home after trying to escape  // ?
 infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 pulmonary edema.  The interstitium is slightly prominent but this likely
 reflects age related change or small airways disease.  On the lateral view,
 there are several calcified rounded opacity measuring up to 2.2 x 1.6 cm which
 project over the anterior mediastinum on the lateral projection, and therefore
 could represent calcified lymph nodes related to prior granulomatous
 infection.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Comparison to prior imaging
 would also be helpful to better delineate the etiology. Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Aorta unfolded and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 2. Nonspecific rounded calcified opacities on the lateral projection may
 represent calcified mediastinal nodes suggesting prior granulomatous
 infection.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
