                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with palpitations and shakes.  Patient also with
 history of diabetes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Apparent
 increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette is likely exaggerated due to
 low lung volumes.  However, the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and may
 reflect cardiomegaly or a pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, possible mild cardiomegaly or a
 pericardial effusion.
 
 2.  No other acute cardiopulmonary process.
