                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The central
 catheter tip of the right chest port terminates in the distal SVC.  The
 patient is slightly rotated.  There is a nodular opacity adjacent to the left
 heart border, which is compatible with the known history of pulmonary nodules.
 There is no clear sign of effusion or pneumonia, although assessment is
 limited by the patient's rotation, and no correlating of effusion or pneumonia
 on the lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No bony
 abnormality is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute findings.
 
 2. Nodular opacity adjacent to the left heart border, compatible with known
 history of pulmonary nodules.  
 
 3. No clear sign of effusion or pneumonia, although assessment is limited by
 rotation.
