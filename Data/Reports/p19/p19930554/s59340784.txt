                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy for breast cancer, presenting with pain crisis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided indwelling catheter is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.    No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Note is made of asymmetry in the patient's breast shadows, smaller on the
 left.  There appears to be some increased density over the left lung. Given
 the density of the left breast on the ___ CT, it is possible that this is
 accounted for by increased soft tissue density in the present. In addition,
 there is a nodular density at the left lung base, projecting adjacent to the
 left cardiac contour, measuring approximately 21 mm in diameter.   Possible
 right base pulmonary nodules similar to the ___ film.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  The right
 lung is grossly clear. Though the mediastinum appears midline, there does
 appear to be slight asymmetry in the lungs, slightly larger on the right.  No
 CHF or right-sided opacity is detected. No effusion is detected  on either
 side. 
 
 Punctate density overlying the left neck may represent a small amount of
 carotid artery calcification. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible slight asymmetry in the size of the hemithoraces, though not
 clearly different from ___.
 
 2.  Hazy opacity overlying the left lower lung. Given the degree of increased
 density in the left breast on the ___ CT, this could be due to density
 of the overlying breast tissues, rather than a primary process in thelung. 
 
 3.  Nodular density at left lung base concerning for a lung nodule or
 pulmonary metastasis.  This probably is accounted for by a pulmonary nodule
 seen on the ___ chest CT(series 2, image ___ from that study), though has
 likely grown since that time and is clearly larger than on the ___ CXR
 (approximately 21 mm in diameter today versus ___.7 mm on ___ CXR).
 
 4.  ___ CT also described sternal metastasis, which is not readily
 visible on today's exam due to technical limitations of the modality.
 
 5.  The right lung shows no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  Possible right
 base pulmonary nodules similar to the ___ film.
 
 6.  No ptx detected.
