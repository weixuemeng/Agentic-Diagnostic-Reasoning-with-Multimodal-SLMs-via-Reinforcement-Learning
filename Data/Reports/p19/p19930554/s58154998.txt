 AP FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 
 A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC, unchanged from prior.  There is
 no confluent consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Known lung nodules appear
 similar to prior.  There is mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles, which suggests new trace pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Unchanged appearance of multiple
 lung nodules.
 
 2.  Probable new trace bilateral pleural effusions
