                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal ca s/p ___. Extubated. Please
 perform on morning rounds. Patient may transfer to floor this evening.  // NG
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at ___:47, there is opacity along the right chest
 wall, slightly increased. On today's exam, there is equivocal irregularity
 involving at least 1 rib along the lower right chest, as well as a defect in
 the posterior sixth rib that likely relates to the recent surgery. Otherwise,
 I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is the NG type tube extending along the right mediastinum. 
 Additional linear density likely reflects an epidural catheter.  A right-sided
 chest tube is also present, unchanged.
 
 There is mild vascular plethora without frank CHF.  Patchy opacity at the left
 base medially is again noted, possibly slightly increased.  Patchy opacity at
 the right base is similar to the prior film.  No gross effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NG tube extending along right mediastinum in this the patient with a
 history of esophageal surgery .  Tip poorly visualized, but probably lies at
 the level of the right cardiophrenic angle.
 2. Mild vascular plethora, without frank CHF.
 3. Patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly slightly increased on the left side,
 but without significant change on the right.
 4. Opacity along the right chest wall slightly increased, question pleural
 fluid and/or thickening.  Possible irregularity of a lower right chest wall
 rib raising the question of a nondisplaced rib fracture.  Does the the patient
 have focal tenderness in this location?  This is in addition to the
 postsurgical defect of the right sixth rib posteriorly.
