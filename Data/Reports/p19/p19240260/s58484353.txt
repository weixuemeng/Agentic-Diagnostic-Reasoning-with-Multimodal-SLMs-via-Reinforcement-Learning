                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart appears to be borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 Elevation of right hemidiaphragm is age indeterminate.  Atelectasis is
 demonstrated in both lung bases.  No left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is of unknown chronicity.  Comparison with previous radiographs
 is recommended.
