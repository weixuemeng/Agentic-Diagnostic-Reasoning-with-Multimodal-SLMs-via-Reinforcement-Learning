  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position. Moderate left tension
  pneumothorax with catheter in place however, there appears to be a large
  loculated component projecting over the left lower hemi thorax. Component of
  pneumoperitoneum in the abdominal cavity is not excluded.  ED team was aware
  at time of image interpretation.
  
  Extensive opacity projecting over the right greater than left lungs could be
  due to extensive aspiration neck, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection, ARDS.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated d/t respiratory failure  // ? acute
 process, tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above level the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the left
 upper quadrant expected location of the stomach.  There is a moderate left
 pneumothorax with the left chest catheter in place.  Large lucency projects
 over the lower left hemi thorax concerning for large loculated component of
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is shifted to the right.  There is also
 widening of the rib interspaces on the left compared to the right, and
 flattening of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with tension.  There is
 diffuse opacity projecting over the right lung and to a lesser extent the left
 lung which may be due to massive aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, extensive
 infection.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
 low SVC.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is extensive left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left tension pneumothorax with catheter in place however, there
 appears to be a large loculated component projecting over the left lower
 hemithorax.
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 
 Extensive opacity projecting over the right greater than left lungs could be
 due to extensive aspiration neck, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection, ARDS.
 
 Extensive left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema
