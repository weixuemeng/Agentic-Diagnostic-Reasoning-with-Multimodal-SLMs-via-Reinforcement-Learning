 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Autoimmune hepatitis with immunosuppressive therapy, now presenting
 with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is new mild volume loss at the left lung base, with streaky
 opacification and a suspected very small pleural effusion.  More generally,
 there is a diffuse mild interstitial abnormality, which is most prominent in
 the mid and lower lungs and could be seen with pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 In the setting of suspected infection, however, the possibility of atypical
 pneumonia could be considered and more focal developing pneumonia is also a
 differential consideration for retrocardiac opacification at the left lung
 base versus atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality for which fluid overload or atypical
 pneumonia could be considered.
 
 2.  Focal left basilar opacity, possibly developing pneumonia, although
 atelectasis could explain the findings.
