 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  When compared to prior, there has been interval resolution of the
 right hemithorax whiteout.  There is some residual blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle and right basilar opacity.  Right pigtail catheter is again
 seen.  There may be a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Left lung remains
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Nodular opacity over left lung base
 laterally is thought to represent a nipple shadow.
