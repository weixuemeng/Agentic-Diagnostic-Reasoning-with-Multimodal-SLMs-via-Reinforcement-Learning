                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis and hypoxia, now intubated //
 please evaluate position of ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___. ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates initial placement
 of the endotracheal tube into the right mainstem bronchus. The endotracheal
 tube was subsequently repositioned such that the tip ends 2.2 cm from the
 carina. There has been interval clearing of the right base, and new
 obliteration of the left hemi-diaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Probably tiny left apical pneumothorax is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube ultimately positioned such that the tip ends 2.2 cm from the
 carina.
