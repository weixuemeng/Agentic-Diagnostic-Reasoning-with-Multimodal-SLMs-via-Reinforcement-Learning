                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, evaluate for interval change in infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates a Swan-Ganz
 catheter which is far past midline into likely segmental right pulmonary
 artery.  It should be retracted by at least 6-7 cm for more appropriate
 positioning in the proximal pulmonary artery.  As compared to prior study, the
 lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac contour.  The heart and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Diffuse right lung opacities are slightly
 improved with worsened opacification of the left lung, likely equilibrating
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned Swan-Ganz catheter, which should be retracted by at least 6
 cm for more appropriate positioning.
 2.  Equilibrating pulmonary edema, improved on right right and worse on the
 left.
 
 These findings were relayed to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, at 9:37 a.m., three
 minutes after discovery.
