                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, pleural effusion, evaluate heart and lung.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to most recent study, there has been no significant interval change
 with a large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. 
 There may be some increased atelectasis due to leftward shift of mediastinal
 structure.  There is fluid partially loculated within the left major fissure. 
 There may be a tiny right pleural effusion as well.  The right lung remains
 clear.  The left heart border is obscured entirely.  Mediastinal structures
 are otherwise unremarkable.  A right chest Port-A-Cath is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large partially loculated left pleural effusion with probable increase in
 atelectasis.  Tiny right pleural effusion.
