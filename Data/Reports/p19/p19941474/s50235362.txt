                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemia and ?tamponade  // please eval for
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unilateral interstitial and alveolar pattern in the left lung is accompanied
 by left-sided volume loss and a moderate left pleural effusion.  There is a
 suggestion of a possible left hilar mass, difficult to assess on this portable
 radiograph. Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unilateral combined alveolar and interstitial pattern in the left lung with
 associated volume loss and left pleural effusion. These findings raise the
 possibility of a central malignancy with associated lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis and possible postobstructive pneumonia and atelectasis.
 Contrast enhanced CT may be helpful for further assessment if not already
 performed.
