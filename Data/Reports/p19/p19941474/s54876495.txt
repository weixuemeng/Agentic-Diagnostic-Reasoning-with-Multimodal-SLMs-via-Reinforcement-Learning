                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion.  Evaluate pleural
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right chest wall port catheter terminates in the upper right atrium.  In
 comparison to ___, there has been significant improvement in the left
 pleural effusion.  The mass like lingular opacity and reticulonodular opacity
 seen in the mid and lower left lung could reflect changes secondary to
 lymphangitic spread.  Left-sided pleural catheter projects over the left lung
 base.  Lungs are hyperinflated which may reflect underlying COPD.  Heart size
 is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Significant interval decrease in left pleural effusion following placement
 of pleural catheter.
 2.  Masslike lingular opacity and reticulonodular opacity in the left mid and
 lower lung.
