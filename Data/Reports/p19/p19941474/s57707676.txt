                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new L sided pleurex  // r/o ptx      r/o ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ most recently
 ___ 24:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pneumothorax which developed following evacuation of left
 pleural effusion with the insertion of a left pleural drain earlier today has
 increased in size, now moderate.  There is no appreciable residual left
 pleural effusion although there is pleural thickening.  Pleural restriction
 may explain failure of the left lung fully re-expand.  Mediastinum is now
 midline.  Atelectasis at the right lung base is mild.  A small right pleural
 effusion could be present.  Heart size is probably normal.
 
 Right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends low in the right
 atrium, as before.  No right pneumothorax.
