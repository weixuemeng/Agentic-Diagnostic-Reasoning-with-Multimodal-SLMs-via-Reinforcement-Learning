 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, s/p chest tube  // eval for

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph from 1 day earlier, a left pleural
 catheter remains in place with persistent loculated left basilar hydro
 pneumothorax.  Confluent opacity adjacent to left heart border likely reflects
 the patient's known lung cancer and adjacent atelectatic lung parenchyma.  A
 unilateral interstitial pattern in the left upper lobe is concerning for
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Right lung is hyperinflated and grossly clear
 except for minimal linear scar or atelectasis at the right base.
