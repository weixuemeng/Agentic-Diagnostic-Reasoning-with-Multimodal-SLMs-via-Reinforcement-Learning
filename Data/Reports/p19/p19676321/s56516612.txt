 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, emesis, hypoxia and sepsis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia.  Its size is even increased
 somewhat, although this may be due to waxing and waning degree of aeration. 
 The pulmonary vasculature appears indistinct, suggesting mild fluid overload. 
 Streaky opacities at the medial lung bases are typical for atelectasis
 associated with a large hiatal hernia.  It is difficult to exclude small
 pleural effusions, although none are explicitly demonstrated.  Spinal
 curvature and moderate degenerative changes along the lower thoracic spine
 appears similar, but not completely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large hiatal hernia, somewhat increased air bubble associated with it.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
