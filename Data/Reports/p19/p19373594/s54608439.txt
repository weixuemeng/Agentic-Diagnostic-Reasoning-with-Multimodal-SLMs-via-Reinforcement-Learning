                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is a persistent opacity in the left mid lung, as well
 as a posterior basilar component which is probably in the left lower lobe. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent patchy left lower lung opacities, although improved in
 the posterior basilar component.  Pneumonia could be considered for this
 appearance in the appropriate clinical setting but there has been some
 improvement in opacification.
