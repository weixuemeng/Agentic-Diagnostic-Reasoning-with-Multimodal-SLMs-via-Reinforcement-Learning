                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M s/p fall, L hemothorax with L3-9 rib fx, ___% on 3L NC 
 // interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are better aerated with interval resolution of the left lower lung
 collapse.  Left lower and mid thoracic rib fractures appear slightly more
 displaced as compared to prior.  Bilateral patchy lung opacities could
 represent either consolidation or asymmetric edema; contusion is considered
 less likely.  A very small left apical pneumothorax is noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged given changes in positioning. 
 Multiple contiguous left rib fractures appear more displaced as compared to
 the previous radiograph of ___
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multifocal patchy airspace opacities could represent multifocal aspiration,
 developing infection, or asymmetrical edema. Contusions is considered less
 likely given new and progressive course of most of the opacities compared to ___.
 2. Interval resolution of left lower lung collapse.
