                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pain to the left posterior chest status
 post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no focal consolidation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Several left-sided rib
 fractures are identified which include lateral fifth sixth and seventh ribs as
 well as the seventh rib posteriorly.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect atelectasis though a small
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Increased density within the soft
 tissues is likely reflective of focal hematoma as in association with the rib
 fractures.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Several left-sided rib fractures with associated chest wall hematomas. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small pleural
 effusion and/or atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Findings were communicated via telephone with the ordering
 physician doctor ___ by Dr.  ___ at 14:53 on ___.
