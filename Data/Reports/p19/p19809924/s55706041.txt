                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a left
 basilar opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  There are also
 diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities, greater on the right than the left.
 There is an unusual curvilinear lucency in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, lateral to the liver, though no definite free air is noted under the
 diaphragm.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Remote right sided rib fractures are noted.
 There is an acute distal left clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar opacity which is non-specific, but may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia.
 2.  Minimally displaced distal left clavicular fracture.
 3.  Ill-defined curvilinear lucency in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, lateral to the liver, of unclear significance.
 4.  Peripheral interstitial opacities greater on the right than the left which
 may represent chronic changes.
