                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected position of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Prominent costochondral calcifications are seen
 bilaterally.  Rounded left hilar calcifications may be due to calcified hilar
 nodes which could be due to prior granulomatous disease.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aortic arch
 is calcified.
