                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is stable substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some decrease in the degree of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Right lung is relatively clear.  On the
 left, there is retrocardiac opacification consistent with substantial volume
 loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would be impossible to exclude.
 
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip remains in the right pulmonary artery.
