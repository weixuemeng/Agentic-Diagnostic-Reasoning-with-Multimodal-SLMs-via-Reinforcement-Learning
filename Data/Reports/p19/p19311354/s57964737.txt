                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung volumes.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary
 artery.  Left lower lobe opacities are consistent with increasing atelectasis.
 If any, there is a small left effusion.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.
