                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for consolidation in a patient with shortness of breath
 and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple sternal wires and
 severe cardiomegaly, which appears unchanged.  Increased bilateral opacities
 are consistent with increased vascular congestion and mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis
 and edema.  No definite focal consolidation is identified.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. No definite focal consolidation identified.
