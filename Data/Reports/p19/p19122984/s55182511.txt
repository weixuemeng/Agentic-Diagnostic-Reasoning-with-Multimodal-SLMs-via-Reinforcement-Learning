                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates now
 re-intubated  // placement of ETT?      ; ___ year old man with OD, rhabdo,
 respiratory failure now extubated.  // interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from 04:29 and 06:38 hours.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The initial radiograph from ___ hr shows acute worsening of extensive
 bilateral airspace opacities.  The left subclavian central venous catheter
 terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged.
 
 The followup radiograph from ___ hr shows improved airspace opacities
 following intubation.  The new ET tube is slightly high-riding.  Advancement
 by 2-3 cm is suggested for more optimal ventilation.  In addition, a new
 nasogastric tube enters the stomach, but its side port is at the GE junction. 
 Advancement by 5 cm is advised.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Initially worsening bilateral airspace opacities have improved following
 intubation.  The rapid change may be due to severe pulmonary edema, pulmonary
 hemorrhage, or drug reaction.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 12:28 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
