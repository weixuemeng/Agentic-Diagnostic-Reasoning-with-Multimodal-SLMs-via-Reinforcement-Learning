                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been slightly advanced.  The tube now projects 2.6 cm above the carina.  The
 opacities in the right lung apex have decreased in extent, but the basal
 opacities, in part aggravated by the bilateral pleural effusions, are still
 seen in almost unchanged manner.  No pneumothorax.
