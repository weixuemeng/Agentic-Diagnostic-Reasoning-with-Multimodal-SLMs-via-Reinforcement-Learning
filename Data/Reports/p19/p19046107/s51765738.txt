                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, with COPD and CHF.  Evaluate intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects above the level of the clavicles,
 approximately 8.5 cm from the carina.  For more optimal positioning, could be
 advanced by 2 cm.  Bilateral alveolar opacities and broncho-vascular
 congestion likely indicates pulmonary edema.  There is a small to moderate
 right pleural effusion and a left pleural effusion is likely.  Stable
 cardiomegaly compared to the prior study from ___.  Prominence of the
 mediastinum is likely due to unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 8.5 cm from the carina
 and for more optimal placement, this could be advanced by 2 cm.
 
 2. Bilateral alveolar opacities and bronchovascular congestion consistent with
 severe pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion and likely left pleural
 effusion.
