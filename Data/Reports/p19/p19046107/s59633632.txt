                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina with
 the neck in a flexed position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing
 for accentuation by rotation and lower lung volumes.  Moderate right and
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusions appear larger than on the prior
 study, but positional differences limit comparison.  Pulmonary edema has
 apparently slightly progressed since the recent radiograph, but remains
 improved compared to an earlier ___ radiograph at 8:26 a.m.
