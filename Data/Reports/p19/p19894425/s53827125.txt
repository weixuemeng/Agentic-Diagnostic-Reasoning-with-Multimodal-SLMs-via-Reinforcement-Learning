                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion, falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears at least mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 Minimal streaky opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are
 seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with left lower lobe atelectasis.
