                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and diarrhea, on chemotherapy.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is chronic elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  The lung volumes are low; however, there is no focal
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is normal and there is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  Hilar
 structures are unremarkable.  Cervical fusion hardware and abdominal clips are
 constant.
 
 The known pulmonary nodules are better evaluated on the prior CT and are too
 small to evaluate by radiography.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
