                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with central line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis
 versus small effusion.  Left lung is clear, noting that the costophrenic angle
 is excluded from the field of view.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  New left-sided central
 catheter is seen; however, the tip projects over the upper mediastinum on the
 left.  Anterior cervical fixation hardware is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided central catheter with tip projecting over the upper
 mediastinum on the left.  The exact location of which is indeterminate on this
 study; however, please see subsequent CT scan for additional detail.
