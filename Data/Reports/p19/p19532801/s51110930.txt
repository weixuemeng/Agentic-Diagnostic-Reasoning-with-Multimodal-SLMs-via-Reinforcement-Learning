                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, on chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided central venous catheter has been removed.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Evidence of volume
 loss in the right lung with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and collapse
 of the right middle lobe appear chronic.  Linear opacities within the right
 lung base likely reflect right lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.  Left lung
 is clear.  No pleural effusion is identified.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged, and there is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.  Partially seen is anterior cervical fusion hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic right middle lobe collapse with adjacent right lower lobe subsegmental
 atelectasis.
