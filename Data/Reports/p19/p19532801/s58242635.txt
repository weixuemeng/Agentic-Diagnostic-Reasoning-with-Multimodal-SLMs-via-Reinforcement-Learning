 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pancreatic carcinoma, now with

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Unchanged appearance of thoracic
 aorta which is mildly widened with prominent aortic arch, but no local contour
 abnormalities or advanced wall calcifications are present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Similar as on previous examination, the
 pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an irregular peripheral pattern, coinciding
 with some flattened diaphragms consistent with COPD.  Acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are not seen.  The next previous examination (___),
 plate atelectasis in the right lower lobe and middle lobe area have
 disappeared.  Unchanged appearance of left-sided rib resection (#6).
