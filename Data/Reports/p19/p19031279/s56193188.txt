                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the
 apices, compatible with underlying emphysema.  Calcified granuloma is noted
 within the right mid lung field.  Linear opacities within the right lung base
 most likely reflect atelectatic changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.  Emphysema.
