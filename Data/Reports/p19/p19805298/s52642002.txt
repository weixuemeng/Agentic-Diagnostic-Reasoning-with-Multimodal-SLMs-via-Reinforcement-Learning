                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with severe congestive
 heart failure and new onset of chest pain and protrusion of bony protuberance
 of lower sternum.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  Upper
 zone redistribution, perihilar haziness, and interstitial linear opacities are
 more pronounced that might be consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the
 right, are noted, overall unchanged as compared to the prior study.  Pacemaker
 defibrillator leads are in unchanged position.
