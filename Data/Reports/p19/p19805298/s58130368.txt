                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and a basilar predominant
 interstitial abnormality which most likely represents interstitial edema. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right, with
 interval decrease in size since the prior radiograph.  There is also improving
 aeration in the left retrocardiac region, likely resolving atelectasis.
