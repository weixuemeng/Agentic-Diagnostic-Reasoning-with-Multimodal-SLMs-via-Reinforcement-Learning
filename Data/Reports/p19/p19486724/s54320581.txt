                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Patchy right infrahilar
 opacity has remained the same and so is probably due to minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
