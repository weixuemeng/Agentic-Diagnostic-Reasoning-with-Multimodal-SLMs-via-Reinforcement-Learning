                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Generalized weakness, nausea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest provided.  The lungs appear
 largely clear bilaterally aside from mild dependent basilar atelectasis. 
 Slightly underpenetrated technique limits the evaluation for subtle mild
 congestion, though there is no overt evidence for pulmonary edema.  The heart
 size appears normal.  The mediastinal contour is stable and within normal
 limits.  The bony structures appear intact.  There is no free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No overt evidence for pneumonia or edema.
