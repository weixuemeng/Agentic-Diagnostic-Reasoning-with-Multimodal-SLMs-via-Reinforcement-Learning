                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough and asthma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear
 clear.  The right lower mediastinum has a bulging contour which may be
 associated with an abnormality of the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Bulging right atrial contour; this appearance is not necessarily abnormal
 but follow-up echocardiogram should be considered in addition to correlation
 with clinical history.
