                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration.  Unfolding and calcification are noted along the aorta.  The
 interstitium is mildly prominent suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are suspected, greater on the left than right. 
 Posterior opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus has a convex
 appearance which may reflect loculated pleural effusion or potentially
 parenchymal opacity that could be seen with atelectasis.  Pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Small pleural
 effusions.  Posterior left-sided basilar density, which is highly non-specific
 but a combination of atelectasis or pleural effusion may be suspected;
 pneumonia is difficult to completely exclude, however.  Follow-up chest
 radiographs are suggested to show resolution or stability, and comparison to
 prior radiographs, if available, may be helpful if clinically indicated.
