                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, volume overload versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 22:15 p.m.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with the prior film, there has been improvement in the patchy
 bilateral opacities, suggesting interval improvement in CHF findings.  There
 is residual patchy opacity in the left greater than right lungs.  No effusion
 and no confluent consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged,
 but unchanged.  Suspect background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval imrpovement, but with continued slightly patchy
 interstitial opacities, in left greater than right lungs.  The differential
 diagnosis includes resolving CHF, but interstitial pneumonia or other
 interstitial disease cannot be excluded.
