                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a left chest wall mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly has increased since ___.  Fullness in the right
 tracheobronchial angle is due either to azygos dilatation from elevated
 central venous pressure, or volume or right heart failure or adenopathy, more
 likely vascular.  Pulmonary vascularity in the right lung is normal.  On the
 left, there is an abnormality in the upper lobe, which is also low in volume,
 consisting of a large group of ring shadows varying in caliber.  I suspect
 this is severe bronchiectasis, but I would welcome a chest CT scan to
 delineate all of the abnormalities described previously.  There may be a very
 small left pleural effusion.
