                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:28 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ongoing cough and wheezing after surgery. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since tracheal extubation, lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature has
 grown engorged, mediastinal veins are dilated and cardiomegaly has worsened,
 all pointing towards volume overload and/or cardiac decompensation.  I do not
 see lobar collapse, appreciable pleural effusion or large pneumonia.
