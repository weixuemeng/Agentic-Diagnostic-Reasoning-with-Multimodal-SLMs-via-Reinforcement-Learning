                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mediastinal
 contours are relatively unchanged.  There is continued mild pulmonary edema,
 slightly worse compared to the previous exam, with patchy bibasilar opacities
 likely reflecting atelectasis noted 1.  Additionally, as noted previously,
 prominent ring shadows are noted within the left upper lung field suggestive
 of bronchiectasis.  Left apical pleural thickening is unchanged.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild to moderate degenerative changes
 are noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis, but aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.
