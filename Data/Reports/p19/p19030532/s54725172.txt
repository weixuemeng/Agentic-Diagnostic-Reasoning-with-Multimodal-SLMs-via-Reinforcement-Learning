 HISTORY:  Anginal pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  A metallic stent projects over the left
 heart border.  Heart size is stable.  Slight widening of the vascular pedicle,
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, and mild perihilar haziness are
 consistent with new mild pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes are low but there is
 no focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New mild pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation.
