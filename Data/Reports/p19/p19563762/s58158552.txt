 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:53 AM
  1. Peribronchial opacification in the lower lung extending to the chest wall,
  concerning for aspiration.
  
  2. Left lower lobe collapse, which could also be possibly due to aspiration.
  
  3. Left pleural effusion.
  
  4. ET tube and right IJ central line are in adequate position.
  
  5. NG tube terminates with the side port at the level of the GE junction. The
  tube could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.

  1. ET tube and right IJ central line are in adequate position.
  
  2. NG tube terminates with the side port at the level of the GE junction. The
  tube could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
  
  3. Linear opacity in the right lung base and dense retrocardiac opacity,
  likely representing atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in
  the right clinical setting.
  
  4. Left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with transfer, intubated, sepsis  // Eval for
 infiltrate and tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube and right IJ central line are in adequate position. The NG tube
 terminates with the side port at the level of the GE junction. The tube could
 be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Peribronchial opacification is seen in the right
 lower lung extending to the chest wall, concerning for aspiration. There is
 left lower lobe collapse, which could also possibly be due to aspiration.
 Diffuse hazy opacity at the left lung base suggests a left pleural effusion.
 There is no effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung extending to the chest
 wall, concerning for aspiration.
 
 2. Left lower lobe collapse, which could also be possibly due to aspiration.
 
 3. Left pleural effusion.
 
 4.  ET tube and right IJ central line are in adequate position.
 
 5. NG tube terminates with the side port at the level of the GE junction. The
 tube could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings from original wet read communicated to Dr.
 ___ at 7:51 a.m. ___ by phone.
