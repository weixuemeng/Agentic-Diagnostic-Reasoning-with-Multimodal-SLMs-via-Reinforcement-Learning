                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and rhonchi, worse during the night.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 multiple prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is a rounded opacity
 adjacent to the left heart border, relatively nodular, approximately 18 mm in
 diameter, better appreciated on one of the two PA views and not clearly seen
 on the lateral view.  This finding might represent focus of infection,
 potentially developing or resolving.  Alternatively, pulmonary nodule cannot
 be excluded.  
 
 As per followup, assessment of the patient four weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy may be considered with chest radiograph to document
 resolution.  Otherwise, chest CT to exclude the possibility of pulmonary
 nodule might be considered given the lack of this finding on the prior study
 from ___.
 
 Findings submitted to Radiology Dashboard by Dr ___ on ___
