                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with question abnormality in the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.  A
 clinically insignificant region of linear atelectasis in the left lung
 projects lateral to the cardiac apex, probably in the lower lobe.  Of more
 concern is an elliptical opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine
 which could be nothing more than the superimposition of osteophytes and
 inferior pulmonary veins, but could also be a tubular lung lesion like a
 mucoid impaction.  For evaluating that I would recommend routine oblique
 views.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is top normal size, as before,
 but there is no pulmonary vascular abnormality, edema or pleural effusion. 
 Moderate thoracic scoliosis probably contributes to the large osteophytes
 through the mid and lower thoracic spine.
 
 A left pectoral generator sends a thin pacemaker wire at least as far as the
 lower neck.
