                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach.  The heart size is normal.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours otherwise unremarkable.  Except for minimal streaky opacity in
 the retrocardiac region which likely reflects atelectasis, the lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 No displaced fractures are seen.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine with dextroscoliosis present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube tips in standard positions.  Minimal
 left basilar atelectasis, though given the history of seizure, aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
