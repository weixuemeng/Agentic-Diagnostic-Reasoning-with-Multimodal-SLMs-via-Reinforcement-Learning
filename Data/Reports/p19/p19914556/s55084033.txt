                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male who presents for evaluation of a right upper
 lobe abnormality.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___; ___;
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right upper lobe demonstrates a sclerotic reaction likely at
 the first rib.  This appears to have been stable compared to multiple prior
 exams dating back to ___.  However, to delineate if this is
 truly at the rib or intraparenchymal, would recommend additional apical
 lordotic views for further evaluation.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis;
 otherwise, no focal consolidations are seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is stable.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 There is a sclerotic lesion at the right upper lobe which appears to have been
 stable compared to multiple prior exams dating back to ___.  
 
 However, to truly delineate if this is intraparenchymal or part of the rib,
 would recommend apical lordotic views.
