                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  The PAC is noted
 overlying the left lateral upper hemithorax.  There is a relative opacity
 projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung, possibly in the lingula which
 could relate to patient positioning, underlying consolidation due to an
 infection or contusion given not excluded.  No pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Thoracic scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung is
 nonspecific, however, may represent consolidation which could be due to
 infection or if in the setting of trauma pulmonary contusion.
