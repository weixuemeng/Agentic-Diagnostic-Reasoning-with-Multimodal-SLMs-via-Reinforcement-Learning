 Heart size is mildly enlarged with of left ventricular predominance.  The
 aorta remains tortuous with mild atherosclerotic calcifications.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is re- demonstrated.  Lungs are hyperinflated with streaky opacity

 costophrenic angles suggests trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
