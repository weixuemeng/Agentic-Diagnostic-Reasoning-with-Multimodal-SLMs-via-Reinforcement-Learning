                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified,
 although the extreme lung apices are somewhat obscured by the patient's chin
 projecting over this region.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures with multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Partially imaged is fusion hardware at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 probable bibasilar atelectasis.
