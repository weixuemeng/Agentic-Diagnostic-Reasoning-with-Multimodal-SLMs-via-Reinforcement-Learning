                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Postoperative day 7 after AVR.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A pulmonary arterial catheter, as well as its introducer, have been removed.
 Pulmonary edema has resolved. There is persistent retrocardiac opacification
 which probably reflects a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 perhaps somewhat decreased, however.  A Calcified granuloma projects over the
 right lower lung versus nipple shadow. There is a small pleural effusion on
 the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolution of pulmonary edema. Persistent left base opacification, probably
 due to atelectasis and some degree pleural effusion. Removal of pulmonary
 artery catheter.
