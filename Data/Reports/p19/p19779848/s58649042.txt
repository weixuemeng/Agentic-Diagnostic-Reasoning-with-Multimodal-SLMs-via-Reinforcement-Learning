                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cancer, endotracheal tube placed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube distal
 side port at the level of GE junction/distal esophagus.  Recommend advancement
 of the skull through the stomach.  Stomach is mildly distended with air.  The
 ascending aorta appears slightly prominent and there is a prominent density
 adjacent to the left heart border, underlying aortic aneurysm is not excluded
 versus other mass.  Correlate with prior imaging/history.  Depending on this
 and the clinical scenario, consider followup chest CT for further evaluation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Right axillary surgical clips are seen.
 
 There is a rounded 4 point cm calcification projecting over the right upper
 abdomen, unclear whether external to the patient or possibly representing a
 gallstone.
 
 Deformity of the posterolateral right ___ and 6th ribs raise concern for
 fractures of indeterminate age.
