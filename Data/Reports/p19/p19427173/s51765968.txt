                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, status post right upper lobectomy with small
 apical pneumothorax.  Assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right apical pneumothorax is unchanged in comparison to study performed
 earlier the same day, again measuring no more than 1.5 cm. There is no tension
 physiology, with rightward mediastinal shift reflecting volume loss related to
 recent lobectomy.  Adjacent opacity may reflect a small amount of pleural
 fluid.  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Unchanged hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours.
