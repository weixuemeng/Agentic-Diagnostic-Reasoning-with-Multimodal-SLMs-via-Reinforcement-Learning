                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The aortic arch is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Multifocal calcified pleural plaques are again present. 
 Superimposed is mild upper zone re-distribution of indistinct pulmonary
 vascularity, suggestive of pulmonary venous hypertension or slight congestion,
 somewhat more prominent than on the more recent of the prior examinations. 
 There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared
 to the left.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of a slight vascular congestion or pulmonary
 hypertension.  Calcified pleural plaques, suggestive of prior asbestos
 exposure.
