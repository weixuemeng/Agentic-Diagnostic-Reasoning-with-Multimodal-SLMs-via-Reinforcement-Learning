                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxemic respiratory failure, assess
 for interval progression.
 
 Comparison is to ___ at 2:15.
 
 A portable AP chest film dated ___ at 4 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular introducer catheter has its tip in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  A right subclavian PICC line has its tip at least to level of the
 mid superior vena cava, unchanged.  
 
 2. Bilateral diffuse airspace process appears unchanged with the exception of
 loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure. These findings may reflect
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, though bilateral infectious process cannot
 be entirely excluded.  The right costophrenic angle is not entirely included
 on the current examination.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No pneumothorax.
