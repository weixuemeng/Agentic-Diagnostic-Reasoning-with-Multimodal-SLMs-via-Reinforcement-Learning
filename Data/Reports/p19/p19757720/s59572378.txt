  Orogastric tube tip is in the stomach. New right central venous catheter with
  the tip at the superior cavoatrial junction. Otherwise, little change from
  prior study on the same day at 7:55 am with bilateral pleural effusions,
  moderate on the right, small on the left, and right middle and lower lobe
  opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, an OG tube is in
 place with the tip in the stomach.  However, the sidehole appears to be above
 the esophagogastric junction.  Right IJ catheter tip extends to the
 mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.  Endotracheal tube remains in good position.
 
 There is increasing bilateral opacifications consistent with worsening
 pulmonary edema.  Moderate-to-large right and small left layering pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
