                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard positions.  Bilateral,
 confluent, airspace opacities, right side more than left are unchanged since
 ___.  As mentioned previously, these opacities are likely from
 combination of pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or pleural effusion.  Enlarged
 heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours have similar appearance.  Increased
 retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is similar.
