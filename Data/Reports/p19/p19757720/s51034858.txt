                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with likely alveolar hemorrhage and
 worsening edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG
 tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Of note, the lower aspects of
 the hemidiaphragms were not included on the film.  Cardiomegaly is obscured by
 lung abnormalities.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidations, severe on the
 right and moderate on the left, are unchanged.  As mentioned in prior studies,
 these findings are a combination of pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and
 pleural effusions.  There are no new lung abnormalities.  The main pulmonary
 artery is enlarged.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured by lung abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.
