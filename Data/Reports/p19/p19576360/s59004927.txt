                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hemoptysis, hypoxia  // evaluate for
 worsening extent of opacities/possible pulmonary hemorrhage
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ study there is diffuse pulmonary opacities seen,
 with progression in the right upper and right middle lobes as well as new
 opacities in upper lung.  Again given the setting setting of hemoptysis
 pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded as well as pulmonary edema and
 aspiration.  Given the rapidity of the progression pneumonia is less likely. 
 Again seen is a right jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the
 right atrium.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable when compared
 to previous studies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of diffuse pulmonary opacities in the right upper, right middle,
 and left upper lobes that may represent pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of
 hemoptysis versus pulmonary edema versus aspiration, with pneumonia being less
 likely given rapid time course.
