 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pacer leads are in stable position. 
 Hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.  The lungs
 are essentially clear, and the right lung base is partially obscured by the
 overlying pacemaker generator. Prosthetic valves and sternal wires are
 unchanged. Blunting of left costophrenic angle likely indicates a small
 pleural effusion.
