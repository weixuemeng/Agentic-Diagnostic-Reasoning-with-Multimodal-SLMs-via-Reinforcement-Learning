                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD, pretransplant.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is still enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure,
 though substantially less than on the prior study.  The more focal
 opacification at the left base is not appreciated at this time.  There is
 fluid within one of the major fissures, though no substantial free pleural
 effusion.
