                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fevers.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Diffuse interstitial opacities have not
 significantly changed from prior.  Posterior costophrenic angles are sharp. 
 Thickening along 1 of the major fissures may represent fluid or pleural
 thickening.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  
 Right chest wall dual lead pacing device is again seen.  There is a new right
 chest wall tunneled dual lumen catheter with distal tip in the right atrium. 
 There is no new confluent consolidation.  No acute osseous abnormality
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change since prior.  Diffusely increased interstitial
 markings compatible with interstitial edema versus chronic changes.  No
 superimposed acute process.
