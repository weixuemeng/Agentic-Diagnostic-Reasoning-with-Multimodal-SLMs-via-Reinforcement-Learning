                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates enlarged heart, replaced aortic valve and
 substantial mitral annulus calcifications, unchanged since the prior study. 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is diffuse interstitial opacities as well as
 engorgement of azygos vein as well as bilateral small pleural effusions,
 findings most likely consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.  An
 additional left lower lobe pneumonia is a possibility and potentially other
 areas of infection are present obscured by the interstitial pulmonary edema.
