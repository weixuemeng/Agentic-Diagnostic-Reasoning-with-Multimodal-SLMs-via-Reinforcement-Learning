 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve
 replacement.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with calcification of the aortic knob again noted.  Mild pulmonary
 edema appears progressed compared to the prior exam with small bilateral
 pleural effusions, also minimally increased compared to the prior exam.  Left
 basilar opacification likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval worsening of mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
