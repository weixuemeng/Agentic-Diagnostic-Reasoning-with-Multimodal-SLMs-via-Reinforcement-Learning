                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and mitral valve
 replacement.  A right internal jugular dialysis catheter continues to
 terminate in the right atrium, and biventricular pacer/ICD leads are unchanged
 in position as well.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening
 interstitial edema.  Additionally, a more confluent area of opacity is present
 in the left lower lobe, partially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  This is
 concerning for developing pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are present
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lower lobe consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Worsening interstitial edema and small pleural effusions.
