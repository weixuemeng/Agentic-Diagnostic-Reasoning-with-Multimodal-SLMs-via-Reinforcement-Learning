                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent ICD implant, evaluate lead positions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS: There is a biventricular pacer/ICD with leads terminating in the
 coronary sinus and right ventricle.  The right atrial lead takes an unusual
 course, directed posteriorly.  While this appears unchanged from the prior
 study on the frontal view, an aberrant location should be considered.  There
 is no evidence of lead fracture or displacement.  Aortic valve prosthesis is
 again noted.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are present.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There has been further improvement in the
 mild pulmonary edema.  Further aeration of the left lung base is consistent
 with resolving atelectasis and pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Lead intended for the right atrium is  directed unusually
 posteriorly.  While this lead is likely in the right atrium, correlation with
 electrophysiology measurements would be helpful.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:50 AM on ___ by telephone ___ minutes after discovery.
