                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for evidence of acute congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior study of ___, the appearance
 of the chest is unchanged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with
 multiple mediastinal surgical clips compatible with prior CABG.  A mitral
 valve prosthesis is unchanged in position or appearance.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and stable with minimal calcification of the aortic knob.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  No significant pleural effusion
 is present.  On the lateral radiograph, there is opacification along the
 fissure of the left lung corresponding to left basilar opacification on the
 frontal radiograph.  This finding is unchanged from the prior study and may
 represent partial lobar collapse or fluid trapped within the fissure.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild edema and left lower lobe atelectasis vs fluid in
 the fissure.  Unchanged from ___. Bronchial obstruction cannot be
 excluded.
