                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, ? pna; on pripor x-ray question
 atelectasis vs conosolidation  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no significant interval change since the prior radiograph performed
 yesterday evening. A biventricular pacer defibrillator is visualized.  The
 hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in the right
 atrium.
 
 There is persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by
 interstitial pulmonary edema. No new areas of focal consolidation are
 identified.  Left lung base opacity is probably due to a combination of a
 small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. A small right pleural
 effusion is also noted. Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Stable pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
 2. Left lung base opacity is probably due to a combination of small left
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
