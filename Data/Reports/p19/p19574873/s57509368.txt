 compared to the prior exam. There is stable mild cardiomegaly compared to the
 prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. Note is made of discontinuity of the
 left hemidiaphragm, with herniation of fat, better characterized on the prior
 CT. Note is made of extensive aortic calcification on this study, however
 extensive coronary and aortic calcifications were also better characterized on
 the prior CT. Deformities of the right ___th ribs are likely due to old,
 healed rib fractures, as seen on the prior CT. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
