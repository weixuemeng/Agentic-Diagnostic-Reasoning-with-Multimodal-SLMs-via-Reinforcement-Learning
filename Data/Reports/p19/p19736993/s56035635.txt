                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:28 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with SIADH.  Evaluate possible mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  Patient has had median sternotomy.  Pulmonary
 vasculature, particularly centrally, is engorged, but there is no pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusion.  Heterogeneous opacification at the lung apices is
 probably scarring.  A small mass could be obscured, and therefore CT scanning
 would be helpful.
