                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of respiratory distress and transient hypoxia.  Please
 evaluate for interval change, aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs dated back to ___, most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is evidence of the moderate cardiomegaly, slightly worsened
 compared to the exam from ___ however stable compared to the most
 recent exam.  The previously noted vascular congestion in the upper lungs has
 improved; however, there appears to be an interval increase in the left
 perihilar opacification compared to the prior exam, suggestive of worsening
 aspiration.  There are stable small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous opacification of the lung apices is
 likely secondary to scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval worsening of the left perihilar opacification consistent with recent
 aspiration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:30 p.m. by Dr. ___
 ___ by telephone on the day of the exam.
