                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views were reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 are well expanded.  Vague density in the lateral left mid lung field without a
 clear correlate on the lateral view may be due to overlapping structures, but
 evolving consolidation is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left mid lung zone opacity only appreciated on the frontal
 view which may be due to overlapping structures, but evolving consolidation is
 not excluded.
