                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, history of congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Linear opacities within the left upper lung field may reflect atelectasis or
 scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 Lungs are hyperinflated. Mild degenerative changes are seen within the
 thoracic spine. Multiple rounded radiopaque densities projecting over the
 right shoulder are likely external to the patient. Marked narrowing of the
 right acromiohumeral interval suggests rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
