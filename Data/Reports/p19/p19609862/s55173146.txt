                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever and cough, evaluate for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Mildly increased
 interstitial markings at bilateral lung bases are unchanged from multiple
 prior studies and likely represent chronic interstitial lung disease.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The descending aorta is partially
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged chronic interstitial lung disease.  No focal consolidation.
