                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Oxygen desaturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ obtained at___ at 14:50.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are somewhat widened, but this is likely due to low lung volumes and the
 presence of mediastinal fat.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Minimal bibasilar streaky
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
