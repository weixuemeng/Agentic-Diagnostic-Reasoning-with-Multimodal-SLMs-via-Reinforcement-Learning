                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears borderline enlarged.  Tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta is again noted with atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the
 aortic knob.  Convexity at the AP window and left superior mediastinal contour
 likely reflects known mediastinal lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the
 previous CT.  Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vascular
 markings and bullous changes in the right lung base compatible with emphysema.
 There has been interval development of a moderate size left pleural effusion. 
 Left basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded.  Known lung nodules are better assessed on previous CT. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval development of moderate size left pleural effusion with associated
 left basilar opacity, likely compressive atelectasis.  Infection, however,
 cannot be completely excluded.
 2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the previous CT.
 3. Emphysema.
