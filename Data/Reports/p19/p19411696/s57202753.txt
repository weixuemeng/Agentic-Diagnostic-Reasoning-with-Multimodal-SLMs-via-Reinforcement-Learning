 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Slight upper
 paratracheal opacity likely represents prominence of vascular structures and
 without change since the prior study and without indentation on the trachea. 
 Evidence of DISH is seen along the thoracic spine.  In addition, degenerative
 changes are also seen along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of free air
 beneath the diaphragms.
