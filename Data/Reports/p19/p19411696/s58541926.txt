                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube has been placed which makes a single coil within
 the stomach.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for differences in technique.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size.  The lung volumes appear low.  The lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air is demonstrated. 
 Degenerative changes involve each shoulder.  The right acromiohumeral interval
 appears narrowed which can be seen with rotator cuff pathology, and suture
 anchors in the left humeral head suggest prior rotator cuff repair, also
 present before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Nasogastric tube terminating in
 the stomach.  No evidence for free air.
