                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of recent pneumonia,
 routine followup to evaluate for resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  As before, relatively high positioned diaphragms obscure
 partially the cardiac silhouette, but significant increase of the heart size
 is unlikely.  Thoracic aorta, as before, mildly widened and elongated but
 without local contour abnormalities or advanced wall calcifications. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and no new acute parenchymal
 infiltrates can be identified.  Also, the lateral pleural sinuses are free and
 the same holds for the posterior pleural sinuses on the lateral view.  Again,
 no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  On the preceding examination, the
 right basal lung portion was considered to be improved in comparison with a
 more remote study of ___, but no reoccurrence of infiltrates has
 occurred.  A chest CT of ___ is also reviewed, and the findings
 reported the diagnosis of scattered inflammatory processes in the lower lobe
 area as seen on chest examination of ___.
 
 Today's followup examination does not show any reoccurrence of the acute
 infiltrates in this patient with general findings compatible with COPD. 
 Centered at kyphotic curvature related to a vertebral body compression
 fracture of old date is again seen and appears stable.
