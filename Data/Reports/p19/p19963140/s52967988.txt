 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Posterior spinal hardware is
 seen extending from the mid thoracic spine inferiorly. There has been recent
 left thoracotomy with reason removal of a left chest tube.  Previously noted
 left pneumothorax has resolved. In this patient with known left hilar mass,
 there is persistent vague opacity in the left mid upper lung which may reflect
 known lung cancer. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with probable
 small left effusion and left basal atelectasis. The right lung remains clear.
 Heart size cannot be assessed. The mediastinal contour appear is similar to
 prior. Bony structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of left pneumothorax with persistent left mid to upper
 lung opacity compatible with known malignancy. Interval elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with left basal atelectasis and small left effusion.
