                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluate for pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior radiographs performed four hours
 earlier.
 
 No definite pneumothorax is seen; however, there is curvilinear density within
 the left apex, which is felt not to represent a pneumothorax given that lung
 markings are seen beyond it.  Moreover, there is pleural effusion at the left
 base.  There is also apparent air/fluid level at the left base similar to the
 prior study, which is of unclear etiology as it is not well seen on the
 lateral view.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with prominent
 loops of colon.  The visualized right lung field is clear.  Spinal hardware is
 present.
