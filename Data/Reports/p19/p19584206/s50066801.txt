                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with POD ___ s/p AVR and MVR  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 Sternotomy wires and 2 prosthetic valves again noted. The degree of
 retrocardiac density is not significantly changed and, as before, is
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The possibility
 of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear, without CHF or right-sided infiltrate. Equivocal trace right pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above
