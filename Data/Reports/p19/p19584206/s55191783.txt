 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is a further increase in
 diameter of the cardiac silhouette, with blunting of the left costophrenic
 sinus, potentially reflecting small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged
 extensive left lower lobe atelectasis.  In the ventilated parts of the lung
 parenchyma, there is no evidence for the presence of pneumonia.  The sternal
 wires and valve replacement are in unchanged position.
