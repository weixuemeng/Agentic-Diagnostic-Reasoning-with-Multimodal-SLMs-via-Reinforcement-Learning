                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, incr secretions  // PNA?      PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 10:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 10:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the proximal
 stomach.  The bilateral pleural effusions appear smaller, but this likely is
 related to differences in patient positioning.  Stable bibasilar opacities
 favoring atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be
 considered in the correct clinical setting.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi-erect technique.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
