 Please evaluate for PNA.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left lung is clear.  A region of very mild peribronchial opacification in
 the right lower lung could be atelectasis or early pneumonia. I would suggest
 followup in 24 hours with conventional chest radiographs.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
