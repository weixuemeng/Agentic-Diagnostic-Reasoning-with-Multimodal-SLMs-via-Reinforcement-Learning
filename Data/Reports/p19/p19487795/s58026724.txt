 AP CHEST, 6:59 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after tap of a right pleural effusion.  Evaluate
 possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller, but I do not think there is a
 pneumothorax.  Vascular congestion has improved, moderate right basal
 atelectasis has not.  Heart size is normal.  Dialysis catheter tips are in the
 low SVC and upper right atrium, as before.
