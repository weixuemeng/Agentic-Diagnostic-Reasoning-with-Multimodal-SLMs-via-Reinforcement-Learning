                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever, evaluate for new
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  On AP frontal view,
 appearance of previously described HD catheter unchanged.  Heart size not
 increased.  The right-sided pleural effusion appears to have increased again
 and is now resulting in diffuse basal haze overlying the right lower lobe
 structures as the fluid apparently is layering in the posterior pleural
 compartments.  There is no evidence of new discrete local pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates which can be identified on this single AP portable
 chest view.  Had a lateral view been repeated similar as ordered on
 yesterday's examination, the increasing degree of right-sided pleural effusion
 could have been assessed more appropriately and a possible pneumonia been
 eliminated with greater assurance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased pleural effusion on right side, no evidence of new
 acute infiltrate seen on single AP chest view.
