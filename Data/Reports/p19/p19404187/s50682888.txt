                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with known left upper lobe mass, hemoptysis.  Please
 evaluate for pleural effusion, empyema, interval change of tumor.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates decreased size of the
 left upper lobe opacity possibly due to resolution of hemorrhage, now
 measuring 2.8 in the craniocaudal dimension compared to 3.5 cm on prior study.
 There is persisitent if not increased streaky retrocardiac opacities, possibly
 related to aspiration. No definitive opacification concerning for pneumonia.
 Minimal left costophrenic angle blunting, likely represents small left pleural
 effusion.  No osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in size of left upper lobe opacity, possibly
 reflecting resolution of prior hemorrhage.  Likely small left pleural
 effusion.
