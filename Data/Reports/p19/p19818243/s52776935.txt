 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable apparently supine chest radiograph is submitted with
 regular and edge enhancement technique.  A temporary transvenous pacing line
 is seen extending over the expected course of the right internal jugular vein
 down across the right side of the heart with the tip at the expected level of
 the right ventricle.  Other radiodense lines in the view of the film appear to
 be outside the patient.  Compared to prior study from one day earlier, both
 hemidiaphragms are now obscured related to some combination of pleural fluid
 and subsegmental atelectasis, the former most likely.  Taking into account
 differences in projection, the heart and mediastinal contours are not
 significantly changed.  Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen at
 both carotid bifurcations.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Hazy obscuration of both hemidiaphragms and hilar region most likely
 related to atelectasis, as no fluid is seen tracking.
 2.  Temporary pacer line appears in adequate position.
 3.  Carotid vascular disease.
