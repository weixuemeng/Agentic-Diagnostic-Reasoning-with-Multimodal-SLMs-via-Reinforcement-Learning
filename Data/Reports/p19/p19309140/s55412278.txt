                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall with right chest wall pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No acute
 fracture is detected radiographically, but the sensitivity of routine chest
 radiography for rib fractures is low.  Right axillary round calcification is
 seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute findings.  Sensitivity of routine chest radiography for rib fractures
 is low.  If there is high clinical suspicion, dedicated rib series should be
 performed.
