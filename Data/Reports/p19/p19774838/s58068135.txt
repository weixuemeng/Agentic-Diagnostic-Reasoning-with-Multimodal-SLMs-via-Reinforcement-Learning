                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with presentation of V tach and interventional
 procedures and IABP question line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable AP radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, the IABP has been removed.  ET tube, NG
 tube, and left PICC line catheter are unchanged.  A Swan-Ganz catheter tip is
 seen in the right main pulmonary artery.  Again seen are bilateral diffuse
 hazy opacities with haziness at the bases, which could represent pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Removal of IABP.  Otherwise, no significant change.
