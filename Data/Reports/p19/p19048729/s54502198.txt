                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT.  // ? NGT placement, ? worsening
 ARDS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 3 hours prior, 6 hours
 prior, and 10 hours prior on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an
 endotracheal tube terminating in mid thoracic trachea and an enteric tube
 terminating within the stomach.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities continue to
 increase.  There is a new small to moderate right pleural effusion and
 possible trace left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Continued increase in bilateral pulmonary opacities, possibly/pulmonary
 edema or ARDS, although multifocal pneumonia is also a consideration in the
 right clinical setting.
 2. New small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Of note, pleural effusions
 are less commonly seen in ARDS.
