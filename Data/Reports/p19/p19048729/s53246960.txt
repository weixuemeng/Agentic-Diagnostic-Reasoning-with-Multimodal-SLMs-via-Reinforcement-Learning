 INDICATION:  ___M intubated
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine portable AP radiograph through the chest demonstrate an
 orogastric tube which appears to traverse along the expected course of the
 esophagus with terminal and within the stomach. An endotracheal tube is
 identified 5.7 cm from the level of the trachea in appropriate position.  Low
 lung volumes and patient rotation. Limited assessment of cardiomediastinal
 contours. Additionally, low lung volumes resulting crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube appear in appropriate position. Limited
 assessment of cardiomediastinal contours and the lungs due to low lung volumes
 and patient rotation.  Attention on follow up radiographs recommended.
