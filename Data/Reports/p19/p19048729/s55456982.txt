                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rapidly worsening inability to ventilate,
 severe shock s/p arrest.  // ? ETT placement, ? ARDS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 2.5 and 6 hours prior on the
 same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A semi upright portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a endotracheal
 tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and an enteric tube which
 terminates just distal to the GE junction.  There are low lung volumes, as
 before.  The heart is likely normal in size, allowing for exaggeration due to
 low lung volumes.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities are increased compared to the
 most recent chest radiograph.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased bilateral pulmonary opacities, possibly flash pulmonary edema. 
 However, in the right clinical setting, ARDS or multifocal pneumonia can also
 be a consideration.
 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Enteric tube terminating just
 distal to the GE junction.  On subsequent chest radiograph, this tube is
 advanced.
