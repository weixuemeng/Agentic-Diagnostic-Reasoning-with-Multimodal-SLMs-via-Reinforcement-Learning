                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Post-surgical.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is new mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with streaky opacity
 most suggestive of minor atelectasis.  On the left, there is a streaky left
 retrocardiac density, most suggestive of atelectasis, with a possible trace
 pleural effusion.  The lung volumes are low.  Cholecystectomy clips project
 over the right upper quadrant.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild atelectasis as well as new mild
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm; infection is difficult to
 exclude although doubted.
