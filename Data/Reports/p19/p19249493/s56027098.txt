                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Ovoid calcification seen on shoulder x-ray, question location.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the ovoid
 calcification projecting over the soft tissues of the axilla.  This could
 represent a calcified node or less likely a skin lesion.  The lungs are clear
 without infiltrate or effusion.  The bony thorax is normal.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are normal.
