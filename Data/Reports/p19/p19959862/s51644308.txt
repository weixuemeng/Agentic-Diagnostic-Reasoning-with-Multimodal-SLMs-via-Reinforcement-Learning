                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New right IJ.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating in the low SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are prominent right greater than left
 perihilar opacities.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace
 right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiac silhouette is
 top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Right greater than left perihilar opacities may be due to infection vs
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, other alveolar process not excluded.
