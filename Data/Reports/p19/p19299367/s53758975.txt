                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Angina.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Slight prominence of the hila may be due to vascular engorgement without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
