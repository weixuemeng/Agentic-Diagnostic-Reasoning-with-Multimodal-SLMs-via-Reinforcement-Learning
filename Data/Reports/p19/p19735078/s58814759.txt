                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and fever.  History of
 thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and ___ CTA chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with
 persistent small-to-moderate effusion.  Increased opacity at the left
 costophrenic angle is thought to represent fluid within the fissure, and there
 is some fluid seen posteriorly on the left as well.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 grossly clear noting low inspiratory effort.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
