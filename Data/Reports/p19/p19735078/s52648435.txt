                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right-sided back pain.  Status post left chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, similar in configuration, but is somewhat of a
 globular configuration.  Underlying pericardial effusion is not excluded. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles suggests trace pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are stable.
 No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, underlying pericardial
 effusion not excluded.  No chest tube is seen on the images.
