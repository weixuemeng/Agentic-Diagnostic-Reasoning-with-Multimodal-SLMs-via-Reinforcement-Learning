                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post pericardiocentesis with low saturation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has decreased.  Large right pleural
 effusion is probably unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the
 patient.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacities are likely
 atelectases.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small left effusion is unchanged.
