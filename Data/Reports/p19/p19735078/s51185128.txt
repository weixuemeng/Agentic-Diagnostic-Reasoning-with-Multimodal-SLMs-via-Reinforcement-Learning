                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube remains
 in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Persistent opacification at
 the right base is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectatic change.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 Continued low lung volumes.
