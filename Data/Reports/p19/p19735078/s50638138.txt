                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent pleural effusion and recent pericardial effusion of
 unknown etiology.  Please assess for pleural effusion or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval decrease
 in size of cardiac silhouette; however, there is similar "water bottle"
 configuration to the cardiac silhouette suggesting persistent pericardial
 effusion.  Right pleural effusion is decreased, now small to moderate in size.
 Faint opacification projecting over the right lower lung likely reflects
 residual atelectasis.  No pulmonary nodules identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased cardiac silhouette with configuration suggesting
 residual small pericardial effusion.  Slight interval decrease in size of
 right pleural effusion.
