                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening substernal chest pain, previously diagnosis
 of left pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion, with overlying
 atelectasis.  Left basilar consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is
 minor blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle and a trace right
 pleural effusion may be present.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with a
 somewhat globular configuration and underlying pericardial effusion is not
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, left basilar consolidation not entirely excluded.  Possible new
 trace right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette in a somewhat globular configuration,
 underlying pericardial effusion is not excluded.
