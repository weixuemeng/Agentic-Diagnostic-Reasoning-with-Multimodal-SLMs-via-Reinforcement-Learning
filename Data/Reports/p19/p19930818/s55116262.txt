                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dCHF presenting with decompensate heart
 failure  // eval of pulmonary edema. please perform at 6am
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the right IJ line appears to have been retracted,
 and now lies near the cavoatrial junction, perhaps very slightly distal to it.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is a left-sided
 dual lead pacemaker, with lead tips over right atrium right ventricle; marked
 cardiomegaly, with a calcified, unfolded aorta; CHF, with interstitial and
 probable areas of alveolar edema; and small right greater left effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Calcified nodes and granulomas
 again noted, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval retraction of right IJ line, which now lies near the
 cavoatrial junction, possibly slightly distal to it.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  No pneumothorax detected.
