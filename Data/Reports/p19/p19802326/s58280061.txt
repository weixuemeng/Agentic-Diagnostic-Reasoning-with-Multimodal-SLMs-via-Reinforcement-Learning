 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with the aorta appearing mildly tortuous.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
