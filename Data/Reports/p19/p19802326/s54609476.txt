                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis, altered mental status, status
 post nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm to
 the expected region of the stomach, although the tip is outside the field of
 view provided.
 
 There is cardiomegaly.  Bilateral basal opacities are similar to the x-ray
 obtained earlier today and may represent atelectasis versus
 aspiration/pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small left pleural
 effusion is noted.
