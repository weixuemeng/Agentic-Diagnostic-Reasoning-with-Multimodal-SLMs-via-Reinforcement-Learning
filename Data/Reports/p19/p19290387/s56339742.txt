                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Winged scapula on the right.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No mass
 lesion is identified.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal. The scapula is not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: Normal chest radiographs. If a scapular abnormality is suspected
 clinically, dedicated scapular radiograph would be recommended.
