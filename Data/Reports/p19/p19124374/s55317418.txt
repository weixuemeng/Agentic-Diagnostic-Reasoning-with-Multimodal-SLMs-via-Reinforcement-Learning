 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lupus and shoulder pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava, not
 significantly changed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.  There are streaky opacities at both lung bases, new on the right and
 improved on the left, suggesting minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips
 project over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There is again very
 mild rightward convex curvature to the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
