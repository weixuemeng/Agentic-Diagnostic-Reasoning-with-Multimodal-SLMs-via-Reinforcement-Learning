                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lupus and serositis with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid to lower superior vena cava. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear changed.  Streaky opacities
 at the lung bases are more coalescent, corresponding to decreased lung
 volumes, suggesting waxing and waning atelectasis rather than pneumonia.  The
 pulmonary vasculature appears within normal limits.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
