                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lupus presenting with difficulty breathing and pleuritic chest pain.
 Evaluate for pleuritis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a right-sided port
 with the catheter unchanged in the low SVC.  Compared to the prior radiograph,
 there are decreased lung volumes with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  The
 cardiac shadow is larger than the prior radiograph, possibly indicating
 pericarditis as a cause of the patient's pleuritic chest pain.  If there is a
 pericardial effusion, is not hemodynamically significant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  
 
 2. Enlarged cardiac shadow possibly indicating non hemodynamically significant
 pericardial effusion.
