                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for patient rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance, with normal heart size and tortuous thoracic aorta. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and lungs are grossly clear.  Minimal
 blunting of posterior costophrenic angles is new and suggestive of small
 pleural effusions.
