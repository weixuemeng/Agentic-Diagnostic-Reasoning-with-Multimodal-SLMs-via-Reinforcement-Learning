                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chronic cough, fever  // Evidence of acute
 process, infiltrate      Evidence of acute process, infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there is a disparity in radiodensity, right hemi thorax laterally
 more dense than the left, I think this is due to differences in soft tissue
 thickness rather than a widespread pulmonary abnormality.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is exaggerated by the AP projection.   There is no pleural abnormality.  Large
 hiatus hernia is more readily visible on the prior study.  No pneumothorax.
