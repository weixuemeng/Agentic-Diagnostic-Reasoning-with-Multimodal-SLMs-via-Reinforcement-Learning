                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post left VATS and pleural biopsy with a
 question of a pneumoperitoneum on chest radiograph performed 4 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pneumoperitoneum is confirmed and of unclear etiology.  No
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum evident.  Findings consistent with trapped
 lung again identified on the left with pleural thickening decreased
 intercoastal spaces. Multiple opacities in the left upper lobe, lingula and
 left lower lobe are stable.  Decreased density projecting over the left lung
 may reflect improved inspiratory effort, decreased pulmonary edema .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pneumopertoneum.  This finding was discussed with ___ via
 telephone at 12:15 on ___ at the time of confirmation.
 2.  Findings consistent with trapped lung again identified.  Minimally
 decreased left lower lung opacification may reflect decreased atelectasis and
 possibly decreased pulmonary edema.
