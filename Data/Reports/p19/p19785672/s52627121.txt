                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, status post left VATS and pleural biopsy on
 ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pleural thickening and narrowing of the intercostal spaces are
 again noted, consistent with trapped lung.  There is persistent medial left
 upper lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion.  Nodular opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung appears similar and may correspond to the
 pleural mass seen on chest CT.  No new focal consolidation, right pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There has been interval resolution of radiographically detectable
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent evidence of trapped left lung, medial left upper lobe
 consolidation, and small left pleural effusion.
