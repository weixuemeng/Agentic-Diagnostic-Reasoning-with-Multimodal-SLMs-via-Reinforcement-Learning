                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG. Evaluate for pneumothorax after removal of the
 chest tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the right chest tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax
 is identified. The lung volumes have slightly improved, though there is
 persistent retrocardiac atelectasis.  There is no new opacity or pulmonary
 edema.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with an expected post-operative
 appearance. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with
 the tip in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right chest tube removal. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
