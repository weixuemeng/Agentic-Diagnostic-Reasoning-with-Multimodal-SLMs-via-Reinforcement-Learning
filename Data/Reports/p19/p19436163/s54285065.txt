                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is at least mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky and linear
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is visualized. No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
