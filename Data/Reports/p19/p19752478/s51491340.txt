                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  Heart is
 upper limits of normal in size.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present
 without overt evidence of pulmonary edema.  Lungs are grossly clear except for
 a small patchy opacity at the right lung base.  Short-term followup
 radiographs would be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude an active
 process in this region.
