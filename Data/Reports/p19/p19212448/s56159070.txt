                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop fever. Recent left partial nephrectomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  Bilateral hilar enlargement
 is present.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated with vascular indistinctness, and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Opacification of the lung bases likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis although pneumonia is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bilateral
 hilar enlargement compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.
