                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post right CVL IJ placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been
 interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  As before,
 there is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Bilateral hilar
 enlargement is likely due to pulmonary hypertension.  The mediastinal contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 probable small bilateral pleural effusion.  Opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  
  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  
 
 2.  Pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusion.  Opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
