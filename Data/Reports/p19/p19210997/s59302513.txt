                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia and shortness of breath. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___; most recent from
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse patchy
 opacities throughout both lungs, particularly within the right lung base which
 have increased compared to the most recent prior examination.  Given the
 absence of hilar indistinctness and vascular enlargement, findings are most
 suggestive of worsening multifocal pneumonia given the clinical history.  In
 addition, moderate cardiomegaly is stable and no new pleural effusions are
 identified.  Right humeral prosthesis appears similar to prior examination. 
 Severe degenerative change of the left glenohumeral joint is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased diffuse lung parenchymal opacities which are most
 suggestive of multifocal pneumonia given the clinical history and lack of
 evidence for pulmonary edema.
