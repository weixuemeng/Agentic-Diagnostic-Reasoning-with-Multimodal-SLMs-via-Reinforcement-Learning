 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive

 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette
 mildly enlarged and the aortic calcified and tortuous.  Partially imaged is a
 right humeral prosthesis.  Degenerative changes at the left shoulder with a
 possible loose body again seen.
