                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, cough, dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view of the chest provided.  The patient is
 slightly rotated to the left.  There is increased opacity in the right lung
 base which is concerning for pneumonia.  In addition, there is retrocardiac
 opacity, mostly in a linear configuration, which could represent atelectasis,
 less likely pneumonia/aspiration.  A few scattered more nodular-appearing
 opacities are seen in the mid-to-upper lungs, at least one of which likely
 represents an EKG related to sternal artifact.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 large effusion.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the right lung base concerning for pneumonia. 
 Presumed retrocardiac atelectasis.  Additional nodular opacities in the right
 lower lung and left upper lung could represent true pulmonary nodules and a
 non-emergent chest CT is recommended to further assess once the acute symptoms
 resolve.
