                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post mediastinal cyst resection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  Small left pleural
 effusion is present.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Heart size is normal.  Round opacity projecting over the hilar and cardiac
 silhouette is no longer visualized compatible with patient's history of cyst
 resection.  No pneumothorax.  Right-sided chest tube is in place.  Partial
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
