                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:37.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, slightly worse
 compared to the prior exam.  Heart remains mildly enlarged.  Tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta, which is diffusely calcified, is again noted.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left are again present, with bibasilar
 opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is present with loss of
 height of several lower thoracic vertebral bodies, which are age
 indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval,
 with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflecting atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
