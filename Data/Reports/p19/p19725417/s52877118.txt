 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted. 
 There is diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta.  There is perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, with bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflecting atelectasis though infection or aspiration is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.
