                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cancer with malaise, coughing and phlegm.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  No
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. 
 Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs raises the possibility of some chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Some probable fibrotic or atelectatic streaks are seen
 anteriorly at the mid chest level.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 consistent with some pleural thickening.
