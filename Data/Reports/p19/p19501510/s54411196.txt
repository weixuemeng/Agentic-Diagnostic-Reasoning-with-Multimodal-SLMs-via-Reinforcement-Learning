                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with symptoms of pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Patient is known to
 have underlying emphysema accounting for hyperinflation and upper lobe
 lucency.  There are ill-defined peribronchovascular opacities in the lower
 lungs concerning for pneumonia, perhaps slightly progressed from the prior CT
 chest.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal
 contour appears stable.  Clips are noted in the left upper abdomen.  Bones
 appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Emphysema with irregular peribronchovascular opacity in the lower lungs,
 slightly increased from prior CT exam from 2 days ago, likely reflect
 worsening pneumonia.
