                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, especially the left atrium.  A moderate
 interstitial abnormality suggest congestive heart failure.  There is a pleural
 effusion on the left, probably small to moderate in size, and a small
 right-sided pleural effusion.  Fissures appear thickened.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Interstitial type opacification is most confluent in the
 posterior right lower lobe, although suspicion is that this is also edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most consistent with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema,
 accompanied by pleural effusions.  Attenation in follow-up suggested regarding
 more confluent opacity at the right lung base although edema is again the
 suspected etiology; coinciding pneumonia is not excluded, however.
