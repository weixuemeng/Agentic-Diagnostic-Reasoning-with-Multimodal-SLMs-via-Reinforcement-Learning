                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  As on prior, there are
 increased interstitial opacities.  More conspicuous right basilar opacity is
 seen, and there are probable right greater than left pleural effusions. 
 Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at
 the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema and probable right greater than left
 effusions.  More dense right basilar opacity could represent superimposed
 pneumonia.  If desired, PA and lateral could be obtained to further
 characterize.
