                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension
 presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic knob are again noted.  The mediastinal contour is
 similar.  There is mild pulmonary edema, not substantially changed in the
 interval.  Hazy opacities in both lung bases, more so on the left, likely
 reflect small layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is clearly
 evident.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, not substantially changed in the interval with small
 layering bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
