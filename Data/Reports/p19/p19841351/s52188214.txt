                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation, tachycardic, status post spinal fusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  No
 CHF, focal consolidation or effusion is detected.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region may be
 present.  Lateral view raises the question of a very fine infiltrate in the
 upper zone anteriorly.  There is no obvious correlate on the frontal view, but
 the appearance is concerning for an ill-defined early interstitial infiltrate
 that is poorly visualized radiographically. No effusion. 
 
 Prominent loops of bowel, likely colon, noted in the upper abdomen.    No
 frankly dilated loops of air-filled bowel seen on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Borderline cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Possibility of a subtle interstitial infiltrate cannot be excluded,
 particularly in the left lingula and anteriorly on the lateral view.  Followup
 imaging or, if indicated, further assessment with CT could help.  No frank
 consolidation, CHF or effusion identified.
