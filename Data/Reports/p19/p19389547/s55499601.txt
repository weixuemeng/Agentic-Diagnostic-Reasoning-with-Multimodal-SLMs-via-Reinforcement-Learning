                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheobronchoplasty.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence
 of opacification adjacent to the right lateral chest wall.  It is unclear
 whether this could merely reflect change in degree of obliquity of the patient
 or whether there is a reason to suggest increased fluid within the pleural
 space.  The right hemidiaphragm remains sharp and there is nothing to indicate
 layering pleural effusion.
 
 This information has been telephoned to Dr. ___, ___ was covering for Dr.
 ___.
