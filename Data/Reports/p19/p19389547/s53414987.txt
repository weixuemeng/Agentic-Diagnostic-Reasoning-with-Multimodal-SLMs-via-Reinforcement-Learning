 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent tracheoplasty.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing partly
 pleural partly parenchymal opacities on the right have completely resolved. 
 There is an obviously post-surgical rib defect on the right at the level of
 the fifth rib.  Minimal scarring in the region of the middle lobe, but no
 acute changes.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
