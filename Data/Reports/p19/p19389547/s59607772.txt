  Low lung volumes. Right-sided chest tube. Bilateral atelectasis however the
  opacity overlying the left lower lobe is suggestive of a  atelectasis and
  pleural effusion. There is also apparent left hemidiaphragm elevation which
  raises the possibility of phrenic nerve injury. Continued followup is
  recommended.
