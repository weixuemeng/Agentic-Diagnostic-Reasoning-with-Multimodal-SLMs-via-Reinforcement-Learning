                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of sarcoidosis.  Evaluate hila area.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographic studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Symmetric hilar enlargement and widened or bulging mediastinal contours
 indicate adenopathy in both paratracheal, the subcarinal and paraesophageal
 stations, and both hila.
 
 There is a suggestion of mild interstitial abnormality consisting of tiny
 nodules and thickening of lymphatics in the mid and lower lungs as well as at
 least one sub cm nodule projecting over the left ___ anterior rib.  Heart is
 normal size.  There is no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Symmetric adenopathy in the mediastinum and hila, numerous small pulmonary
 opacities, and probable lymphatic infiltration, best explained by sarcoidosis.
 At least one discrete subcentimeter pulmonary nodule, also most likely due to
 sarcoidosis.  Comparison to any prior chest radiographs is recommended to
 establish chronicity of these findings.
