                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and influenza-like illness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A subtle
 patchy left basilar retrocardiac opacity is seen, nonspecific, could be due to
 atelectasis, although a pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Old right-sided rib
 deformity at approximately the right lateral eighth rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar retrocardiac opacity could be due to
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
