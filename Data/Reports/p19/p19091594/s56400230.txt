                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of COPD on home oxygen, lung
 cancer status post left upper lobectomy presents with hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity obscuring medial left hemidiaphragm is potentially
 atelectasis however infectious process cannot be excluded.  Patient is status
 post left upper lobectomy with volume loss of the left hemithorax and post
 surgical changes at the left hilum. Chronic blunting of left costophrenic
 angle noted.
 There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Left posterior rib changes likely postsurgical.
 No evidence of free air below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity obscuring medial left hemidiaphragm potentially
 atelectasis however infectious process cannot be excluded.  Consider PA and
 lateral chest radiograph if patient amenable.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider PA and lateral chest radiograph if patient
 amenable.
