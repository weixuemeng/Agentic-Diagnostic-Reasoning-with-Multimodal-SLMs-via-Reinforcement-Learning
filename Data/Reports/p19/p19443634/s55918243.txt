                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 14:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bibasilar crackles, question
 infiltrate.
 
 Please note that the patient has history of small cell lung cancer treated
 with chemo and radiation therapy.
 
 Pa and lateral views of the chest ___ at 14:22 are submitted and
 compared to previous PA and lateral chest film of ___ as well as
 selected images from a PET CT dated ___, which demonstrated a mass in
 the right medial upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right hilar and suprahilar opacity with associated elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss.  These findings could represent
 post treatment changes, although recurrence should be considered as this
 appears to correlate to the area of the patient's initial mass in ___.  A
 pneumonia could also have this appearance. Further imaging evaluation with CT
 may be helpful in order to differentiate recurrence from an acute infectious
 process at this time.  There continues to be soft tissue fullness in the right
 paratracheal area, which could represent prominent vessels versus
 lymphadenopathy.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac size is stable.  Degenerative changes in the
 thoracolumbar spine.  Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints.  No
 acute bony abnormality appreciated.
