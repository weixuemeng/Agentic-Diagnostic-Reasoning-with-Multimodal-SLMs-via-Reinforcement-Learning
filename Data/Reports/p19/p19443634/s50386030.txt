                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ with same-day CTA of
 the chest at that time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been no significant interval change from the
 most recent prior study of ___.  Right perihilar opacity persists,
 corresponding to soft tissue concerning for recurrent malignancy on prior CTA
 of the chest.  Linear opacities in the right lung apex with opacification of
 the right paratracheal stripe may represent right upper lobe collapse and/or
 radiation changes.  There is no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to low lung volumes.  The
 mediastinal contours are prominent, related in part to unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta and right lung opacities.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable from the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, stable appearance of the chest with right perihilar and
 upper lobe opacities reflecting radiation fibrosis and/or tumor recurrence.
 Possible small left lower lobe pneumonia.
