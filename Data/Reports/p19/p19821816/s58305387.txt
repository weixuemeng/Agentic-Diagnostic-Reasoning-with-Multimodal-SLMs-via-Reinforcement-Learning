                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of hypersensitivity pneumonitis here for slowly
 progressive dyspnea // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Central perihilar ground-glass
 opacity is similar to prior and may reflect changes related to known
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  No significant change from prior.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 stable.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar pattern of perihilar ground-glass opacity likely reflects known
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  Difficult to exclude a subtle superimposed
 process.
