                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fatigue.  History of
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis per prior radiology report.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The degree of interstitial
 abnormality has slightly improved on the left when compared to prior with
 persistent infrahilar and retrocardiac opacities.  Hazy opacity projects in
 the right lung somewhat overall conspicuous compared to prior however appears
 more diffuse in distribution.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement in the appearance of the left lung with residual infrahilar
 retrocardiac opacity compared to prior.  Opacities in the right lung overall
 appear less dense when compared to prior but are more extensive in
 distribution.  Findings again compatible with chronic underlying lung disease
 with potentially superimposed acute component or infection on the right.
