                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are lower compared to the
 prior study.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is
 likely at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged.  Interstitial opacities bilaterally are primarily within
 a perihilar and basilar distribution and appear slightly worse when compared
 to the prior chest radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, and no acute osseous abnormality is seen.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is not engorged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes with slightly increased interstitial opacities
 within a bibasilar and perihilar distribution, which could reflect worsening
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  A superimposed infectious process cannot
 be completely excluded.
