 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Slightly weaker inspiratory effort with subsequent lower lung volumes
 and minimal crowding of the basal parenchymal structures.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Tortuosity of the calcified aorta.  No recent changes
 such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  No evidence of pleural effusions.
