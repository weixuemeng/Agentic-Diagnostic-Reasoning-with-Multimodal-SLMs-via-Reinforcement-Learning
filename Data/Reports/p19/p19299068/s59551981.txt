                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF and interstitial lung disease, now with worsening
 shortness of breath and left-sided chest pain, here to evaluate for pneumonia
 or pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.  CT
 of the chest without contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Note is again made
 of diffuse interstitial opacities with lower lung predominance compatible with
 the patient's known interstitial lung disease.  No superimposed focal
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 stable.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute interval change in diffuse interstitial lung disease.
