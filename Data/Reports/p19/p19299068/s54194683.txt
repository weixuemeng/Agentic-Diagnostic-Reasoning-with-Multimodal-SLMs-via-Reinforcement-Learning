 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:10 PM
  ET tube in position 4.7 cm from the carina.  NG tube with the tip out of the
  field of view.  Persistent diffuse widespread opacities, stable from a few
  hours prior.  Likely a combination of the known ILD and pneumonia, although
  again, superimposed edema is a consideration. Lower lung volumes.  Probable
  stable cardiomegaly, although the cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate
  given the opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:44 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after cardiac arrest.  Check ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 6:14 p.m.:
 
 Severe pulmonary edema has not improved and may have worsened in the left lung
 compared to 6:14 p.m.  ET tube tip is no less than 6 cm above the carina with
 the chin in neutral or elevated position.  There is room to advance the tube
 another 2 cm if more secured seating is required.  Heart is large but obscured
 by edema.  Volume of any pleural fluid cannot be assessed given the size of
 this patient and supine positioning.  There is probably no substantial
 pneumothorax.  An enteric drainage tube ends in the mid stomach.
