                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Diffuse lower lung predominant interstitial opacity appears similar compared
 to prior, consistent with patient's known interstitial lung disease.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart
 size is enlarged.  Increased prominence of the azygous vein suggests fluid
 overload.  The study is slightly limited by motion artifact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interstitial lung disease with cardiomegaly, prominent azygous vein and
 possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
