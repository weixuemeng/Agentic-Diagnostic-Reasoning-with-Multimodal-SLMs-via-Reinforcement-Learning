                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is limited by a combination of optimal positioning,
 relatively low lung volumes, and large body habitus.  With these limitations
 in mind, cardiomegaly and widespread predominantly interstitial opacities
 appear relatively similar compared to the prior radiograph.  Slightly more
 confluent opacities are present at the lung bases, and there is also
 suggestion of small pleural effusions, which were not evident on a prior
 radiograph.  When the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral
 chest radiographs would be helpful for more optimal assessment of the lungs
 and pleura, as well as to allow more accurate comparison to previous
 radiographs.
