                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of congestive heart failure, COPD,
 and asthma with mild leukocytosis, presenting with dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___ and CT chest from ___.  Again seen are
 diffuse bilateral ill-defined opacities throughout the lungs, which appear
 more conspicuous at the bases.  There is no new large dense consolidation, nor
 effusion.  The lung volumes appear appropriate.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings in the lungs
 bilaterally similar to prior exam, compatible with patient's known chronic
 underlying lung disease.  Please note that new subtle regions of consolidation
 or interstial edema would be difficult to exclude given diffuse background
 parenchymal changes.
