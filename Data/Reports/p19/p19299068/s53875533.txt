                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with trouble breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Diffuse
 ill-defined opacities have become more prominent at both lung bases since the
 prior examinations.  No pneumothorax is present.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Current radiograph may represent exacerbation of chronic diffuse
 infiltrative disease such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or reflect the
 superimposition of a secondary acute process such as edema or pneumonia on top
 of chronic changes.
