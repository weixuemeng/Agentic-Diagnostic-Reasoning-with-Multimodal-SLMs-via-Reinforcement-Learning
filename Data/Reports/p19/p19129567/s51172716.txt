                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  End-stage renal disease, Pre-hemodialysis access
 evaluation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for right basal opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis,
 infection is unlikely.  Correlation with PA and lateral views is suggested.
