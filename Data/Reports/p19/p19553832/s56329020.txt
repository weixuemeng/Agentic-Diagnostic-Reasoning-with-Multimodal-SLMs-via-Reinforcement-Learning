                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with C5-C6 subluxation, T8 vertebral body
 fracture and ACDF of C5-C6 for interval change post-extubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Enteric tube traverses the stomach.  Post-surgical changes are
 noted in the lower cervical spine.  Known T8 vertebral body fracture is not
 well evaluated on this study.
 
 Lung aeration appears improved.  Heart appears stably enlarged.  Bilateral
 small pleural effusions appear stable with adjacent atelectasis.  Previously
 noted left basilar atelectasis is again noted in the retrocardiac region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration with bilateral small pleural effusions and
 adjacent atelectasis persisting in the lower lungs.
