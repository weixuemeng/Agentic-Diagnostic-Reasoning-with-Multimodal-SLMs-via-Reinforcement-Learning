 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube positioning.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from the same
 day at 9:31 am.   
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is noted in the region of right mainstem bronchus and
 retraction by 3.5 cm would be recommended for optimal positioning.  The ET
 tube appears properly positioned on the followup radiograph at 9:31 am however
 and no adjustment is needed at this time. 
 
 The heart appears moderately enlarged but stable.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis
 is noted along with mild vascular congestion.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.
 Postsurgical changes are noted in the lower cervical spine.  Known T8
 vertebral body fracture is not well evaluated on this study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube was in the region of the right mainstem bronchus retraction
 by 3.5 cm was recommended for optimal positioning. However, the followup
 radiograph at 9:31 am demonstrates proper positioning of the Endotracheal tube
 and thus no adjustment is needed at this time.
