                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after laryngectomy and
 thyroidectomy, to exclude pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable in appearance.  The upper mediastinal slight widening
 is most likely related to recent surgery.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is surgical drain projecting over the right upper neck. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, partially imaged.
