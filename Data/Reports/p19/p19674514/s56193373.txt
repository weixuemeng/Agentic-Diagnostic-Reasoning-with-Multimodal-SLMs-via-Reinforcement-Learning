                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: ET tube is 6 cm above the carina but remains below the thoracic
 inlet.  An enteric tube terminates within the stomach.  A right PICC line is
 seen terminating in the mid superior vena cava.
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded.  Improved haziness at the lung bases compatible
 with resolving pleural effusions.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. 
 Pleural calcifications are again noted.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: ET tube 6 cm above the carina but below the thoracic inlet.
