                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with severe mitral regurgitation and prolapse. 
 Preoperative assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe heterogeneous opacification in the left mid lung extending from the
 hilus to the lateral chest wall, new since ___ is most likely pneumonia,
 and the interval enlargement of the left hilus and fullness in the prevascular
 mediastinum would be due to reactive adenopathy.  However if the patient does
 not manifest pneumonia, aggressive malignancy should be considered and
 investigated with CT scanning. The extent of cardiac decompensation judged by
 pulmonary vascular caliber is stable although moderate enlargement of the
 heart is slightly larger.   There is no pleural effusion. This interpretation
 was discussed by telephone with a member of the cardiac surgery care team at
 ___AM, ___.
