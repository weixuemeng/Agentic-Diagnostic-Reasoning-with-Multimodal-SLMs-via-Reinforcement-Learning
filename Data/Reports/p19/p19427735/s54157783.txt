                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with mitral valve
 replacement, followup. 
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of the low SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated, minimally increased since the prior
 study, although it does potentially maybe due to upright position of the
 patient during the chest radiograph.  No pneumothorax is seen.
