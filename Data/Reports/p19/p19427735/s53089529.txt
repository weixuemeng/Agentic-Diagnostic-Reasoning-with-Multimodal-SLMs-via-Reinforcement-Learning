                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent multifocal
 pneumonia, assess for interval resolution.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, left upper lobe consolidation has almost
 entirely resolved with only minimal linear opacity still present, most likely
 reflecting scarring.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Rest of
 the lungs are clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Almost entire resolution of left upper lobe pneumonia.  Follow up
 in four weeks for documentation of complete resolution is recommended.
