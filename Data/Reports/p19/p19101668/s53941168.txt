                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath.
 
 Please assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low; particularly in that
 context, faint basilar opacities are likely due to minor atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiothoracic process. Patchy
 opacities likely attributable to minor atelectasis.
