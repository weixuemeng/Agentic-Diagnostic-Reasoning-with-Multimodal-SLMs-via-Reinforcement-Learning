                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post hanging, respiratory failure, extubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  ET and NG tubes have
 been removed.  There is significant improvement in aeration of the lungs with
 resolved pulmonary edema.  There is a small residual left pleural effusion and
 left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is right perihilar opacity which could
 represent atelectasis, though pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the correct
 clinical setting.  Heart size appears grossly stable.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval improvement in aeration of the lungs with
 persistent right perihilar and left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis. 
 Small residual left effusion.
