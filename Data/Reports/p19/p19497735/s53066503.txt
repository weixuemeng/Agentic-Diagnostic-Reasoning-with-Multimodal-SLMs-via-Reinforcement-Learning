 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:30 PM
  AP portable chest radiograph is compared to radiograph dated same date at
  10:45.  A right chest port terminates at or just below the cavoatrial
  junction.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable relative to prior
  examination.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Lung volumes are low.  There
  is no focal consolidation which is convincing for pneumonia.  No pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
