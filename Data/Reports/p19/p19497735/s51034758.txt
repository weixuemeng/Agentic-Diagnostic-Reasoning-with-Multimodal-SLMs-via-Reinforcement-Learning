                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Low lung volumes are present. 
 Heart size appears moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is distinct with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted.  Widening of the superior mediastinal
 contour may be reflect underlying lymphadenopathy.  Patchy and linear
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  There may be
 a small right pleural effusion, though no large pneumothorax is identified on
 this supine exam.  No displaced fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy and linear opacities, likely
 atelectasis.  Please note that aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.
 2. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 3. Widened superior mediastinal contour suspicious for mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.
