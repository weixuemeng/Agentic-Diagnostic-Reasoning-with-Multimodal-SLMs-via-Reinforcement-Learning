                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged,
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base is slightly worse
 compared to the previous chest radiograph.  The left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased patchy opacification in the right lung base could reflect worsening
 atelectasis however infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
