                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in the bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior study there has been an interval increase in the right-sided pleural
 effusion that now tracks superiorly along the right lateral hemithorax.  The
 trace left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Linear opacity in the right lung
 may represent compressive atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Two chest tubes with tips ending in the right lung apex are
 unchanged in position.  ___ in the mid to lower portion of the right lung
 are again noted.  Small collections of fluid in the anterior soft tissues and
 pleural space are likely related to the recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion.  Unchanged left pleural
 effusions.
