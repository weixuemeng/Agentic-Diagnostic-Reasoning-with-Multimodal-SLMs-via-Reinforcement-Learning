                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the chest tubes
 have been removed and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Some increased
 opacification is seen at the right base consistent with atelectasis, small
 effusion, and an area of loculated gas in the region of the costophrenic
 sulcus laterally.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect
 developing consolidation.
