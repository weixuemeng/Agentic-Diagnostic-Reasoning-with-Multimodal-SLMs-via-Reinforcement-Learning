 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p VATS ___ hamartoma, POD#1 Right CEA. 
 // Asymptomatic hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal shadow is unchanged.  No airspace opacification.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Mild density seen in the left costophrenic
 angle which may represent atelectasis or a small pleural effusion.  Suture
 material projecting over the right hilar area.  Narrowing of the subglottic
