                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman struck by car  // ?injury
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The examination is limited due to is placement of the patient's arms across
 the lower chest, obscuring detail of the lower mediastinum and lung bases as
 well as the pleura and ribs in this region.  Heart size and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits, and lungs are grossly clear.  Minimal
 blunting of left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly could reflect pleural
 thickening or small effusion.  Mild compression deformities at the
 thoracolumbar junction on the lateral radiograph rib indeterminate age without
 older studies for comparison.  No acute, displaced rib fractures are evident
 on this limited assessment.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited chest radiograph due to partial obscuration of the lower chest as
 described above.  Within these limitations, no acute traumatic injury is
 identified in the chest.  If clinical suspicion is high, consider repeat
 radiograph with improved positioning of the arms or a CT scan.
