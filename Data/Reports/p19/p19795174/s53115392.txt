                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M on chemo with dyspnea  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is
 slight blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle which may be due to
 a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No focal consolidation is
 seen in the right lung.  Subtle opacity at the left lung base may relate to
 overlap of vascular structures versus early/focal pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace right pleural effusion.  Subtle opacity at the left lower lung may
 represent overlap of structures or focal pneumonia.
