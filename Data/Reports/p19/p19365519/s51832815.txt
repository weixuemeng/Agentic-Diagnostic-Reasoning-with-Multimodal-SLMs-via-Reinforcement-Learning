                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post VATS left wedge resection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to prior study, the left-sided chest tube has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is atelectasis at the left base and some
 hazy opacity along the lower left chest wall, which may be slightly more
 pronounced.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base and minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is new.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is probably unchanged. The left hilum appears prominent on the current
 study. The patient's left breast prosthesis is faintly visible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of chest tube.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 Minimal left base atelectasis and left lower chest wall opacity is slightly
 more pronounced.
