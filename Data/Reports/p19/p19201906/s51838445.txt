                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status, evaluate for
 infiltrate or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are in general low lung volumes with retrocardiac and left
 lower lobe atelectasis along with some streaky atelectasis in the right lower
 lobe. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, but no evidence of
 overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral atelectasis likely due to low lung volumes. Follow up
 PA and lateral radiographs can be obtained when the patient is stable to
 better evaluate for lung pathology.
