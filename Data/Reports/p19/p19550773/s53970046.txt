 of the right heart border by the pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a pleural drainage catheter projecting over the right

 single view, and correlation with output is recommended.  Large right pleural
 effusion with associated compressive atelectasis, not significantly changed
 compared to the prior study from ___.
