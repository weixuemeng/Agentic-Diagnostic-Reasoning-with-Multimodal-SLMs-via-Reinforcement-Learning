                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion is present with compressive atelectasis of the
 right lung accounting for near complete opacification of the right hemithorax.
 Mediastinal and left hilar contours appear unremarkable.  Heart size cannot be
 assessed given the presence of the large right pleural effusion.  Left lung is
 clear.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen likely reflective of prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.  Clear
 left lung.
