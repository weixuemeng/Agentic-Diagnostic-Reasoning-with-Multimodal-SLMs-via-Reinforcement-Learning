                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  New opacification in the mid right lung field is also concerning for
 interval development of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again demonstrated is a right hilar mass with worsening volume loss in the
 right lung and unchanged nodular pleural thickening.  Increased interstitial
 opacities throughout the right lung may reflect worsening lymphatic
 engorgement superimposed on tumor and infiltration.  Small to moderate size
 right pleural effusion is without substantial interval change.  Left lung is
 hyperinflated without new focal consolidation.  No left-sided pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased volume loss in the right lung and increased interstitial opacities
 in the right lung suggestive of worsening lymphatic engorgement, superimposed
 upon tumor infiltration.  Unchanged small to moderate right pleural effusion.
