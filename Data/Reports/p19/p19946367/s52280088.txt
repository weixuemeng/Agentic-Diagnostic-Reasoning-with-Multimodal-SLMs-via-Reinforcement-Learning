                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent intubation/pneumonia.
 
 Comparison made to previous study dated ___ at 15:56.
 
 A portable supine chest from ___ at 3:44 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has the tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  External pacing wires are in place.  There is interval worsening
 of bilateral effusions and right airspace disease which may reflect moderate
 pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage or ARDS should also be
 considered.  Retrocardiac region difficult to assess but could reflect lower
 lobe collapse, compressive atelectasis or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.There is marked patient rotation, limiting evaluation of the cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  However, the heart remains enlarged, most likely
 representing cardiomegaly as no large pericardial effusion was seen on the
 recent chest CT of ___.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiographs. 
 Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  Degenerative
 changes in the spine.
