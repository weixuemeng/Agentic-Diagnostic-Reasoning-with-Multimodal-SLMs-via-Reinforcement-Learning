 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pna on ___ cxr. ?pna resolved
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  Lung volumes are again low, with continued
 obscuration of the left heart border. These are most likely atelectatic
 changes in the left lung base.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal without
 pleural effusion.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Continued obscuration of the left heart border favors left lower lung
 atelectatic changes over pneumonia. Otherwise, stable chest x-ray.
