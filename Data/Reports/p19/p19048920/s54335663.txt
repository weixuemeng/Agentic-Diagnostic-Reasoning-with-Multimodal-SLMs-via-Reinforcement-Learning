                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and left-sided back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a persistent opacity projecting
 over the spine in the lateral projection which remains concerning for lower
 lobe pneumonia.  However, the right lung base appears clear on the current
 frontal projection and there is increased opacification of the left base with
 a new small left pleural effusion.  Findings likely reflect ongoing left lower
 lobe pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia with new small left pleural effusion. 
 Previously seen opacity within the right lung base is no longer evident.
