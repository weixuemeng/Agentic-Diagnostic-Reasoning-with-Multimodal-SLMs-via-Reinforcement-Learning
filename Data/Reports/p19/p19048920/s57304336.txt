 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new atelectasis
 appeared at the right lung bases.  There is, however, no evidence of
 pneumonia.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus could suggest the
 presence of a minimal left pleural effusion, combined to a minimal left
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
