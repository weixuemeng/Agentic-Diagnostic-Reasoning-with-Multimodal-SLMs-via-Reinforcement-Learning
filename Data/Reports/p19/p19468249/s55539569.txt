                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new  right internal jugular central venous line
 placement/ evaluate CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of
 the mid SVC. Heart size is normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 within the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Calcified mediastinal
 lymph nodes are present suggestive of prior granulomatous disease. Hilar
 contours are normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified. No pulmonary edema is visualized. 18 mm nodular opacification
 overlying the right mid lung field appears to contain a central area of
 calcification and may reflect a hamartoma. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax.
 2. 18 mm nodular opacity in the right mid lung field for which comparison with
 prior imaging is suggested or consider chest CT for further assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Comparison with previous chest imaging is recommended. If none are available,
 consider non-emergent chest CT for further assessment.
