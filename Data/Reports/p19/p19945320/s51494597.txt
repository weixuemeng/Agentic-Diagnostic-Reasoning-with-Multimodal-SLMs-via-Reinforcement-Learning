                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of discomfort.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight increased opacity at the right lung base which could be due to
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in right base opacity, likely atelectasis. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, early consolidation is not
 excluded.
