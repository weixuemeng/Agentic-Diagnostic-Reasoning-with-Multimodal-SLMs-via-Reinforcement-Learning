                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent seizure and now with altered
 mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from ___
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased density at the
 left lung base is unchanged from ___. A small focus of linear
 atelectasis is seen in the lingula.  The remainder of the lungs is clear. 
 There is no substantial pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for
 lung volumes.  No upper abdominal or osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly increased opacity at the left lung base is likely
 atelectasis, but could represent aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
