                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypertension, lower extremity edema, dyspnea on
 exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous, as seen previously.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Patchy opacities are seen in the right lung base, possibly atelectasis. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities seen.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacity in the right lung
 base, likely atelectasis.
