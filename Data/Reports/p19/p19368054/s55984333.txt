                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with dual-chamber
 pacemaker.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Mild interstitial
 opacities appear to be unchanged and might reflect a combination of underlying
 lung disease and mild vascular engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation to suggest infectious process
 demonstrated.
