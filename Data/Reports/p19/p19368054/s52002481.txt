                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  No focal consolidation,
 large pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild
 central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  However, please note that there was a
 rounded parenchymal opacity seen on the prior study only on the lateral view,
 for which followup to resolution is recommended.  It was not seen on the
 frontal view of the prior study, and should be followed up with lateral view.
