                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of hypertension,
 hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver with abnormal LFTs who presented to the
 ED with imaging suggestive of possible atypical pneumonia now remains
 intubated for worsening ARDS.  // worsening hypoxemia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the previous radiograph of earlier the same date,
 pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema are persistent
 findings.  Tip of endotracheal tube continues to terminate above the thoracic
 inlet level, approximately 6.6 cm above the carina.  This could be advanced
 for standard positioning.  Widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities are
 overall similar to the prior study except for slight improvement in the left
 lung base.  No definite pneumothorax, but the presence of subcutaneous
 emphysema reduces the sensitivity of radiographs for detecting small
 pneumothoraces.
