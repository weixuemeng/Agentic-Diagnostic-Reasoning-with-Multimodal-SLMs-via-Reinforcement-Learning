                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated with free air noted on CXR.  //
 Evaluate for ongoing free air/expansion. Please ensure patient is sitting
 upright for the study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema which limits assessment.  No
 definite free air under the diaphragm seen however dedicated decubitus
 radiographs may be helpful to clarify.  Persistent patchy airspace opacities
 are noted in the bilateral lungs.  A right internal jugular catheter
 terminates in the proximal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change compared to the prior study.
