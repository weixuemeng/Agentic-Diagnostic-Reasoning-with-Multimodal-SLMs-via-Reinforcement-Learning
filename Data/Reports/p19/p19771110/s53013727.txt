                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes.  Multifocal areas of the opacity are new in the
 right upper lobe, new in the right middle lobe and worse in the left perihilar
 region.  The heart is top-normal in size.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is
 mild interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right upper lobe and lingula opacities are consistent with pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting.  Treatment for pneumonia and follow-up
 radiographs in 6 weeks are recommended.  If the opacities do not resolve CT is
 recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  New right upper lobe and lingula opacities are consistent
 with pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Treatment for pneumonia and
 follow-up radiographs in 6 weeks are recommended.  If the opacities do not
 resolve CT is recommended.
