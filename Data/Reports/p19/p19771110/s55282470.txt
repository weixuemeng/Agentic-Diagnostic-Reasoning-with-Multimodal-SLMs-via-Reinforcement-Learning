                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with PNA failing levofloxacin, dyspnea to 40s, hypoxia  //
 eval ? ptx, persistent PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted. Superimposed on atelectasis and
 bronchovascular crowding are diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities
 throughout the lungs which given differences in technique have not
 significantly changed since yesterday's exam.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities which could be seen in the setting of
 pneumonia, potentially atypical, versus edema.
