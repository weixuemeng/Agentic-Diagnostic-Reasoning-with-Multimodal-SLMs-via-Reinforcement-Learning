                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with VV ECMO/ARDS  // Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread subcutaneous emphysema has minimally decreased in extent in the
 interval, but pneumomediastinum has apparently increased.  The presence of
 subcutaneous emphysema reduces sensitivity for detecting pneumothoraces, and
 no large pneumothoraces are evident within this limitation.  Widespread
 pulmonary opacities have slightly progressed in the interval.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
