                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p thoracid duct ligation, now with worsening
 breathing, desat to mid 80s at rest  // respiratory insufficiency, interval
 changes, aspiration vs pna     respiratory insufficiency, interval changes,
 aspiration vs p
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison prior study dated ___ at 07:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ 04:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflecting
 increasing pleural effusion or possibly hemorrhage into the pleural space.
 Clinical correlation is advised. A left basilar chest tube remains in place
 with the small pneumothorax seen on recent CT dated ___ not
 appreciated.  A right basilar chest tube is again seen and there is a small
 but stable right apical pneumothorax. Stable small right effusion. Rounded
 lucency adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm on the previous study does not
 persist. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the opacity of the left
 hemithorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve
 replacement. Patchy opacity at the right lung base persists and may represent
 an area of atelectasis or pneumonia, less likely hemorrhage. Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
