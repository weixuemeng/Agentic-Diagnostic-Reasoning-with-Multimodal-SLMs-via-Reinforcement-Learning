                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob s/p cabg. Assess for pneumonia or heart
 failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph separate ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hypoinflated lungs.
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis again noted. Retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with
 combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid given elevated left hemidiaphragm
 however cannot exclude overlying infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting. No focal opacity. No pneumothorax. Heart size mediastinal contour are
 unremarkable. Multiple clips noted within mediastinum in a patient who is
 status post coronary artery bypass graft. Diffuse hyperdensity of bilateral
 lungs is likely artifactual due to over penetration given hypodensities over
 bilateral subcutaneous tissue.
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact and mitral valve replacement is again noted.
 
 Limited assessment of upper abdomen is unremarkable and osseous structures are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with combination of
 atelectasis and pleural fluid however cannot exclude overlying infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
