                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chylothorax s/p bilater chest tubes. Acute
 left lung white out over night, no s/p new left chest tube.  // Improvement in
 left lung inflation/ptx     Improvement in left lung inflation/ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ 04:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ 07:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a second left sided pleural catheter with introduction
 of some air within the pleural space consistent with a hydropneumothorax but
 no substantial change in opacification of the left hemithorax. Given the lack
 of improvement and when correlated with the CT dated ___, this
 likely reflects left lung collapse given the presence of debris filling the
 left mainstem bronchus on the recent CT study.  Superimposed infection cannot
 be excluded.  Bronchoscopy may be helpful.  Patchy opacity at the right base
 is stable and could reflect an area of aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis.
 No pulmonary edema. Right chest tube in place with stable small right apical
 pneumothorax.  Status post median sternotomy with valve replacement.
 Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, however, is difficult
 given the opacification of the left hemithorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by
 phone on ___ at 10:40am.  She informed us that the second chest
 tube has subsequently been removed and the patient has already undergone
 bronchoscopy.
