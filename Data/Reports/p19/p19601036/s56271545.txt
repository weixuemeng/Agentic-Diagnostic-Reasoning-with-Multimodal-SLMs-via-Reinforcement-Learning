 There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which courses
 below the diaphragm and is coiled within the stomach. Bibasilar chest tubes
 remain in place with no pneumothorax appreciated.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy for CABG and valve replacement with stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Lungs are relatively well inflated with small residual
 pleural effusions and suggestion of possible underlying emphysema.  Patchy
 opacities at the bases likely reflect scarring or atelectasis. No pulmonary
 edema.
