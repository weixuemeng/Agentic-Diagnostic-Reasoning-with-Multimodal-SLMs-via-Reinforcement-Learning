                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a thoracic duct injury, now status-post
 repair. Evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant change since ___ when accounting for differences
 in imaging technique. Persistent bilateral effusions, moderate on the right
 and small on the left, with adjacent stable compressive atelectasis
 bilaterally. Stable elevation of left hemidiaphragm. The left upper lung
 peripheral opacity, better characterized on recent CT as a fluid and air
 collection, is unchanged. The lungs are otherwise clear, without focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila appear Sternotomy wires, prosthetic
 cardiac valve, left PICC line, and enteric feeding tube read, appear intact
 and unchanged in position. Expected post-lymphangiogram appearance of the
 nodes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
