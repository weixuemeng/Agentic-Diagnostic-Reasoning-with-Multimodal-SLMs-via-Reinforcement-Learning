 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:19 AM
  
  
  
  Single AP portable radiograph demonstrates new placement of left pigtail
  catheter. No appreciable left-sided pneumothorax is identified. Persistent
  opacities identified within the left middle lung zone. Additional note is made
  of opacity at the right lung base which may reflect pneumonia and small right
  effusion, unchanged. A right-sided pneumothorax persists stable in size. A
  right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. A right basal pleural
  tube is unchanged in position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusions, recurrent left lung
 collapse, new left pigtail catheter  // Placement of pigtail catheter,
 pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was inserted into
 the left pleural space.  A small part of the left fluid collection has been
 drained. However, the remaining fluid collection is still substantial.  No
 evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Unchanged position of the
 right PICC line and the right chest tube.  The small right-sided pneumothorax
 is unchanged in extent and severity. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.
