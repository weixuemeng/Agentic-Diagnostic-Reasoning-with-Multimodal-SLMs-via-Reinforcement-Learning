                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, rule out pneumothorax status post chest tube DC.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Two films from ___.  
 
 Multiple lines and tubes ,including previously seen left chest tube, have been
 removed.  Right IJ sheath has also been removed.  
 
 Compared with the film from ___ at 9:46 a.m., there is a small amount of
 atelectasis and probable pleural fluid at the left base which has accumulated
 in the interim.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Hazy opacity at the right base is similar to prior film and likely represents
 some layering fluid, along with some associated atelectasis/consolidation. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to prior. 
 Minimal  plate-like atelectasis is noted in the left mid zone. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette, sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of left chest tube.  No pneumothorax detected.  Increased
 atelectasis and probable small amount of pleural fluid at the left lung base.
 2.  Hazy opacity at right base, unchanged -- ? small amount of pleural fluid
 and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 3.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, also unchanged.
