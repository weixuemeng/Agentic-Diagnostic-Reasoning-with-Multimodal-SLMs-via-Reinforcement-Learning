                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pleuritic chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and lungs are
 clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  There is relative
 lucency of the left hemithorax, which could represent a technical artifact.
