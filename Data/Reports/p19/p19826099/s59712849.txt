                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, edema and tachypnea.  Recent postpartum day #5.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mild to moderately enlarged.  Diffuse
 opacification is mildly asymmetric, somewhat more prominent in the left mid
 lung than right, but most likely due overall to pulmonary edema.  Opacity also
 obscures the posterior left hemidiaphragm, which shows upward tenting.  This
 type of appearance could be seen with atelectasis, although infection is not
 entirely excluded by this examination.  Fissures are thickened.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse opacification and cardiomegaly suggesting pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy focal left posterior lower lobe opacity, which can probably be
 explained by atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded.  In addition to
 correlation with clinical presentation, short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful to reassess.
