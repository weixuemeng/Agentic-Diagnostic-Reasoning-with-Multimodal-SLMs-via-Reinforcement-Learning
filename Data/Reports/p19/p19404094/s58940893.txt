                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MCC with hemodynamic instability, splenic flexure,
 rib fractures.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube has been removed.  The enteric tube ends in the stomach.  A
 left-sided chest tube is in place.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are
 again seen.  There is decrease in bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and possibly aspiration.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decrease in parenchymal opacities bilaterally, likely
 representing atelectasis with possible aspiration.
