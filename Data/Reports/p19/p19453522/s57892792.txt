 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued opacification
 involving the mid and lower lung zones on the right.  However, the pattern has
 somewhat change, with the right heart border quite well seen.  This suggests
 that the appearance reflect substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe
 with pleural effusion.
 There is some elevation of the right minor fissure with opacification above
 it.  This suggests some volume loss with superimposed pneumonia in the right
 upper lobe.
 The left lung remains clear.
