                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, fevers.  Assess for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates mild pulmonary
 vasculature engorgement possibly reflecting an element of mild fluid overload.
 Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  
 
 There is slight asymmetric increased opacifiction projecting over the left
 lower hemithorax, not clearly anatomical or intraparenchymal and may be due to
 overlying soft tissue or technique.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.  Increased density projecting below the left hemidiaphragm likely
 relates to significant splenomegaly evident on ___ CT.  No
 osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, likely reflecting element of
 fluid overload.  Slight asymmetric increased opacifiction projecting over the
 left lower hemithorax, not clearly anatomical or intraparenchymal and may be
 due to overlying soft tissue or technique. If continued concern, could be
 further assessed with frontal and lateral radiograph.
