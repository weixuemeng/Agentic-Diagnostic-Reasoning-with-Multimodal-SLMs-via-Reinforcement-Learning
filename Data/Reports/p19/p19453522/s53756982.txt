                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New right subclavian line placement.  Please assess.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 right subclavian line terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion identified.  Otherwise, the examination is unchanged. 
 There is redemonstration of vague opacification projecting over the left
 hemithorax with no clear anatomical relationship and may represent increased
 soft tissue density due to patient's positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right subclavian venous line without pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Stable opacification projecting over the left hemithorax of unclear
 etiology, possibly increased due to patient positioning.
