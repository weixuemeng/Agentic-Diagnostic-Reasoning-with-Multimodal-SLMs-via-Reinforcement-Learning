                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing ventilation requirements.  Assess for interval change
 or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, eight hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  The patient is
 markedly rotated, limiting assessment.  Opacification of the left lower
 hemithorax is unchanged reflecting a combination of stable moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly with superimposed mild bilateral pleural effusions and
 atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.
