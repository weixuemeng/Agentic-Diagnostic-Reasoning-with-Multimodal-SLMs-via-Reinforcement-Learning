 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation, hypertension and diabetes admitted ___ with
 GI bleed status post colectomy on ___.  Evaluate for interval change.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study there is no significant change.  The ET tube, NG
 tube and right internal jugular lines are in unchanged position.  A right PICC
 ends deep in the right atrium. Stable moderate cardiomegaly in a configuration
 which could suggest a pericardial effusion. Substantial retrocardiac
 atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Mild fluid
 overload persists.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right PICC ends deep in the right atrium and could be pulled back by
 approximately 4 cm to be in the lower SVC
 
 2.  Stable moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a configuration
 that could suggest pericardial effusion. Recommend correlation with
 echocardiogram if not recently performed.
