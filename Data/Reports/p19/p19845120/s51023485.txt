                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right colectomy status post Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:06.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiographs of the upper abdomen and lower chest were
 obtained.  The first image labeled "For NGT #1" demonstrates the enteric tube
 curled within the upper esophagus pointing superiorly.  The second image
 labelled "for NGT #2" with a later time stamp demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube
 with the weighted tip within the stomach.  There is otherwise little change
 from the prior study with stable cardiomegaly and bibasilar opacities.  The
 lung apices and right costophrenic angle are excluded from this image.
