 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis of unknown origin, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.

 cardiac silhouette.  Likelihood of atelectasis at the right lung bases and a
 small pleural effusion on the left might combine to a larger left basal
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
