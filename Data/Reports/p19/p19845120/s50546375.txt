                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:08 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.  Assess infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged with a configuration suggesting a
 dilated pulmonary outflow tract, but much of the left heart is enveloped in
 mediastinal fat.  The hilar pulmonary arteries are top normal size.  Lungs are
 relatively clear aside from right infrahilar peribronchial opacification which
 could be atelectasis.  Azygos vein is distended.  Upper lungs show mild
 engorgement of peripheral pulmonary vasculature, but there is no pulmonary
 edema.
 
 The tubular configuration of the trachea and proximal bronchi is conceivably a
 function of severe mediastinal lipomatosis, but CT scanning would be necessary
 to exclude central adenopathy as a cause.  This would also provide useful
 information about cardiovascular abnormalities.
