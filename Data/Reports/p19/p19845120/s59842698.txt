                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE ___ FILM ___ AT 9:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old admitted with septic shock, now with
 increasing oxygen requirement, question consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 13:30.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC.  Lung
 volumes are slightly lower with persistent consolidation at the left base
 likely reflecting combination of pleural fluid and left lower lobe atelectasis
 or pneumonia.  Streaky opacities at the right base are slightly worse,
 suggestive of increasing atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Given the left basilar airspace process, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal
 contours is limited on this study.
