                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged, similar to possibly mildly
 increased as compared to the prior study.  Findings could be due to underlying
 cardiomyopathy however, pericardial effusion is not excluded.  There is slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there may be a small pleural
 effusion.  Trace effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.  Again, there
 is bilateral hilar prominence and vascular cephalization suggesting mild
 vascular congestion.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again seen, possibly mildly
 increased, may be due to underlying cardiomyopathy however underlying
 pericardial effusion not excluded.
 
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
