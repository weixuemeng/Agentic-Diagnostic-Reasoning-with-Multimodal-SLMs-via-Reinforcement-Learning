                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a globular configuration is
 not substantially changed from the prior radiograph and likely reflects the
 presence of a moderate size pericardial effusion, as was previously
 demonstrated on the prior CT.  Aortic knob calcifications are again noted. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is again present.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is minimal streaky atelectasis at the lung bases.
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively similar appearance of enlarged globular configuration of the
 cardiac silhouette likely reflective of a moderate size pericardial effusion.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
