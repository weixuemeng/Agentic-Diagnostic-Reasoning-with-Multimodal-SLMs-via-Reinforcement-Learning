                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status.  // ? pneumonia or
 atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New right lower lung opacities likely reflect asymmetric edema in the setting
 of severe cardiomegaly, although this may be emphasized by volume loss.  
 Concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. Lung
 volumes are decreased with moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are possible. The heart size is unchanged.  A new right
 central line tip is seen in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lung opacities likely represent asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 However, concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical
 setting.
