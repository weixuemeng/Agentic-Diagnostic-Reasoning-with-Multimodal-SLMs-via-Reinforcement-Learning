                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Addendum:  Branching, linear lucencies within the right upper quadrant may
 reflect pneumobilia, particularly if the patient has a history of a prior
 sphincterotomy, or massive portal venous gas, reflecting bowel ischemia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress after extubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Despite the history of extubation, an endotracheal tube is present
 and terminates 1.7 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube ends in the esophagus
 and would need to be advanced at least 10cm to move all the sideports into the
 stomach.  A left subclavian catheter tip terminates in the mid superior vena
 cava.  Orthopedic hardware and a vascular abdominal stent are noted.
 
 The lung volumes are low which results in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is prominence of the central vasculature without overt
 evidence for pulmonary edema.  A rounded opacity is seen at the right lung
 base and is new.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 size in normal.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is unchanged.  
 
 Dilated air-filled loops of large bowel below the diaphragm.  No free air seen
 on this supine only view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. ETT should be pulled back 2-3 cm for better positioning.
 2. Advancement of the enteric tube by at least 10 cm is recommended for
 positioning within the stomach.  
 3. Air-filled loops of dilated bowel, no free air seen on this supine view.  
 4. Right lower lung rounded opacity which may reflect metastatic disease,
 pulmonary infarction or atelectasis.  This could be further evaluated with
 cross-sectional imaging or repeat radiograph at full inspiration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:33 AM on ___ the time of discovery.
