                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This slightly limits assessment of the lung bases. 
 Hazy ill-defined opacity within the right lung base is suspicious for an area
 of infection.  A streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top
 normal, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy right basilar opacity is suspicious for an area of infection.
