 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of vomiting, acidotic.

 costophrenic angle is not well seen, which may be due to overlying soft
 tissue, although a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  However,
 in reference with abdomen and pelvis CT performed at ___
 earlier the same date, ___, no left pleural effusion is seen.  No focal
 consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
