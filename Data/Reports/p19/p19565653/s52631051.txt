                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 11:17 P.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain and hypoxia, question fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Right hemidiaphragm has always been elevated relative to the left but the
 differential has been much greater since ___ than it was previously and
 greater today than on ___.  This could be due to varying degrees of
 atelectasis at the right lung base or a phrenic nerve palsy captured at
 different stages in the respiratory cycle.  There could also be a
 space-occupying process in the right upper abdominal quadrant such as
 exacerbation of hepatomegaly or a growing liver mass.  Heart is normal size
 and mediastinum is not shifted at all to the right.  I would recommend
 evaluation of peridiaphragmatic pathology, either fluid or mass.  Left lung is
 clear and there is no left pleural effusion. 
 
 Healed fractures of the posterolateral and anterolateral portions of left
 middle ribs, the latter more recent and not completely healed are new since
 the end of ___, but with enough bony callus to indicate they did not occur
 in the past several weeks.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed with the house officer caring for this patient at the
 time of dictation.
