 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic valve repair, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The sternal wires show unchanged normal alignment.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia. 
 However, there are bilateral pleural effusions, better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph, with subsequent basal areas of
 atelectasis.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
