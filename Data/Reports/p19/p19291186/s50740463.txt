                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ventriculoseptal defect and pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is severe cardiomegaly, with widening of the mediastinal
 contour.  Additionally, there is a 3.5-cm additional rounded contour at the
 apical lateral aspect of the aortic knob, which appears to be vascular, but is
 unusual in size and location.  The hilar contours show some prominence of
 central pulmonary vasculature.  Trace effusions are present with mild vascular
 congestion.  Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  3.5-cm additional rounded contour at the apical lateral aspect of the
 aortic knob, which is of unclear etiology.  Further evaluation with a
 dedicated chest CT with contrast is recommended.
 
 Results were uploaded to the online ___ critical results database.
