                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Gastric outlet obstruction.  Patient is status post
 esophagectomy with gastric pull-through.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest provided.  As seen on
 prior exam, an NG tube is seen terminating in the lower chest with contrast
 residua seen within the distal aspect of the gastric pull-through.  In this
 patient with diaphragmatic hernias, better assessed on prior CT, air-filled
 loops of colon project over the left lung base.  The mid-to-upper lungs remain
 grossly clear.  No large effusions are detected.  The heart size is difficult
 to assess due to subjacent hernia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Contrast residua within the lower portion of the gastric
 pull-through with NG tube terminating in this region.  Large diaphragmatic
 hernia accounting for opacities projecting over the lower lungs, consisting of
 intra-abdominal fat and loops of bowel.
