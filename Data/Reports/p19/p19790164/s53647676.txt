                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of esophageal conduit, now with dyspnea, here to evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Suture material projecting vertically over the right lung on the
 frontal view is compatible with the patient's esophageal conduit.  An
 air-fluid level in the right lung apex is also related to the conduit.  There
 is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  Complete opacification of the
 right lung base suggests right lower lobe collapse.  Mild left basilar
 atelectasis is new from the prior exam.  A small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion is probably not changed from ___.  A left pleural effusion is
 small, if any.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  The right hilus is obscured by opacification in the right chest.  The
 left hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe collapse and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 2.  Mild left basilar atelectasis, new from prior.
 3.  No definite pneumothorax, although evaluation is limited due to esophageal
 conduit on the right.
