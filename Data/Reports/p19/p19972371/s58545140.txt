                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, history of metastatic melanoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 aorta shows mild unfolding, as before.  The heart is normal in size.  There is
 no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is no pneumothorax.  Slight
 new blunting of each costophrenic sulcus potentially indicates trace
 effusions, but if confirmed, quite small.  Moderate degenerative changes are
 similar along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease aside from perhaps trace pleural
 effusions.
