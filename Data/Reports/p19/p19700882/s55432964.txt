                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Compared with the most recent examination there
 has been interval accumulation of a small to moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion. Linear markings at the right lung base likely represent atelectasis
 versus scarring. A right small apical pneumothorax persists, with concurrent
 pleural thickening and pleural calcification likely sequela of prior insult.
 Left apical calcification and scarring is also present, stable. The left lung
 is clear. There is no left-sided effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiac size is
 top-normal. The aortic valve is replaced. Sternotomy wires are intact
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval accumulation of a small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with
 associated right basilar atelectasis/scarring. Otherwise unchanged appearance
 of the lungs with a small right apical pneumothorax with associated pleural
 thickening and pleural calcification. Left apical calcified pleural plaque. No
 opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
