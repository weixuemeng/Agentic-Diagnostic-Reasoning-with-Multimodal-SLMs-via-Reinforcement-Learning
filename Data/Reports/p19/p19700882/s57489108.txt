                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 743
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post AVR, intubated, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  Right internal
 jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the right pulmonary artery. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  Mediastinal drains and left basilar chest tube remain in
 place.  There are likely small layering effusions.  There is cephalization of
 the vasculature suggestive of pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis
 related to a layering left effusion.  There is also possibly a smaller
 layering right effusion.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable in this post-operative patient status post
 median sternotomy.
