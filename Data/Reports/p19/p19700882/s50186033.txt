                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change in
 the opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis. The effusion on the left has essentially resolved.
 Right apical opacities again are better appreciated on the prior CT scan. 
 Small apical right pneumothorax is probably still present. The PleurX catheter
 at the right base is again seen.
 The left lung is essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
