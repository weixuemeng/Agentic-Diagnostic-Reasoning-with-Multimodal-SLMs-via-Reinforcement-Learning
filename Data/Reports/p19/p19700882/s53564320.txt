                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath for one week post-AVR. 
 Evaluate heart and lungs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___ and chest CT from ___.  There are
 basilar pleural effusions which appeared to have slightly grown in size given
 differences in positioning and technique since most recent exam.  There is
 underlying atelectasis, although a component of infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 Biapical nodular opacities are seen, right greater than left, similar to prior
 CT scan, which appear more conspicuous, likely due to technique when compared
 to most recent chest x-ray.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions with
 underlying atelectasis, noting a component of infection cannot be excluded.
