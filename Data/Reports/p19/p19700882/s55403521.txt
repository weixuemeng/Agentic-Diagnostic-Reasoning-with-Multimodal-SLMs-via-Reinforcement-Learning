                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with aortic stenosis, progression of
 dyspnea symptoms, status post cardiac catheterization today, plan for aortic
 valve replacement, pre-operative chest examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No typical configuration abnormalities
 identified.  Thoracic aorta of ordinary ___ and no significant calcium
 deposits are seen in the wall.
 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are present.  There is mild blunting of the right lateral pleural
 sinus, but as the posterior pleural sinuses are free, there is no evidence of
 free pleural effusion.  No acute infiltrates can be identified.  Skeletal
 structures are well preserved, considering the patient's high age causing mild
 degree of vertebral body demyelinization is seen in the thoracic spine, which
 demonstrates a mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature.  No evidence of
 vertebral body compression fractures is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal heart size, no conclusive evidence for aortic valve or
 aortic calcifications on standard views.  No significant left ventricular or
 left atrial enlargement, and no pulmonary congestion.
