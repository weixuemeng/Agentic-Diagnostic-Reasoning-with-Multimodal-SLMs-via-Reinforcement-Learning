                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minor linear opacities within the left lung
 base are seen, most likely due to atelectasis/scarring.  No new focal
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No congestion, edema
 or large pleural effusions are evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior. 
 Calcifications of the thoracic aorta are stable.  Degenerative changes are
 seen along the thoracic spine. The thoracolumbar junction/upper lumbar spine
 is not well evaluated on this study and compression of vertebral bodies in
 that region can not be excluded.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 The thoracolumbar junction/upper lumbar spine is not well evaluated on this
 study and compression of vertebral bodies in that region can not be excluded.
