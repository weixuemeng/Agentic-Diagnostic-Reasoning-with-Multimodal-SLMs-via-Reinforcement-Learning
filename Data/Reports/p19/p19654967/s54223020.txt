                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:    ___M with eval for edema or pna  // eval for edema or pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph pulmonary edema is nearly resolved. 
 There is an unchanged small right and trace left pleural effusion with
 associated bibasilar atelectasis worse at the right lung base.  Focal opacity
 in the left mid lung and at the left lung base with apparent air bronchograms
 is essentially unchanged.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged left midlung opacity with air bronchograms, concerning for
 pneumonia.
 2.  Possible mild fluid overload without pulmonary edema, improved from prior.
 3.  Right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacity
 potentially atelectasis noting that infection is possible as well.
