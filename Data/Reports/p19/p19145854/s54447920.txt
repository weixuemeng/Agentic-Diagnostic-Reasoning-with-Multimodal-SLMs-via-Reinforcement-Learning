                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and right-sided rib
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lung volumes are extremely low, with mild asymmetric elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Opacity in the right lung base, likely represents
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. A small right pleural effusion is
 likely present. If there is concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series can
 be performed with a marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity is likely a combination of
 atelectasis/consolidation and effusion, but PA and lateral CXR may be helpful
 for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
