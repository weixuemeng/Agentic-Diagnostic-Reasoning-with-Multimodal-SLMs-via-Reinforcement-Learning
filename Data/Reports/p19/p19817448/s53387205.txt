  1. Interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion which is small,
  though not completely assessed as the right costophrenic angle is excluded
  from the field of view.
  
  2. Worsening opacification in the retrocardiac region which could reflect
  worsening atelectasis, aspiration, or infection.
  
  3. Small left pleural effusion.
  
  4. Low lying endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.3 cm from the
  carina, and should be withdrawn for optimal placement.
  
  5. Unchanged metastatic lesions involving the left ___ and 3rd ribs as well as
  the right 4th rib.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is low lying and terminates approximately 2.3 cm from
 the carina.  A nasogastric tube tip appears to be within the stomach.  A
 catheter likely reflecting a chest tube is seen entering via a right basilar
 approach, with tip terminating adjacent to the right hilum.  Lung volumes are
 low.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Previously noted small
 right pleural effusion appears slightly decreased in the interval.  The right
 costophrenic angle however is excluded from the field of view.  Blunting of
 left costophrenic angle is unchanged compared to the prior study, and is
 likely reflective of a small left pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac
 opacification appears progressed when compared to the prior study, and could
 reflect infection, atelectasis, or aspiration.  Expansile metastatic lesion
 involving the left ___ and 3rd ribs with osseous destruction is again noted as
 well as a metastatic lesion involving the right 4th rib.  There is no definite
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion which is small,
 though not completely assessed as the right costophrenic angle is excluded
 from the field of view.
 
 2. Worsening opacification in the retrocardiac region which could reflect
 worsening atelectasis, aspiration, or infection.
 
 3. Small left pleural effusion.
 
 4. Low lying endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.3 cm from the
 carina, and should be withdrawn for optimal placement.
 
 5. Unchanged metastatic lesions involving the left ___ and 3rd ribs as well as
 the right 4th rib.
