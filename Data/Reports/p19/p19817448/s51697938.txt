                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single erect portable radiograph of chest is compared with prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar lung opacities likely
 atelectasis, left side more than right, and mild to moderate left pleural
 effusion is present.  Because of the left lower lung opacities obscuring the
 cardiac margin, assessment of heart was limited.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, left side more than right, and
 minimal-moderate left pleural effusion.
