                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size allowing for this
 factor, but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.  Aorta is tortuous
 and calcified.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Bibasilar atelectasis has
 developed, involving the right lung base greater than the left.  There are
 also new small bilateral pleural effusions.  
 
 A 5 cm diameter, elliptical extraparenchymal opacity (pleural or extrapleural)
 in the upper left hemithorax is new since ___, but is in
 retrospect similar to preoperative chest radiograph of ___.  On
 today's study, there is a question of adjacent rib destruction at the third
 left anterolateral rib level associated with this opacity.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 5 cm elliptical opacity in the left upper hemithorax, with apparent adjacent
 focal rib destruction.  As this finding is new since ___, it is
 concerning for a possible focus of metastatic disease in this patient with
 history of primary renal malignancy. CT may be helpful for further
 characterization.
 
 Dr. ___ has been notified of this finding by telephone at 8:30 a.m.
 on ___ at the time of discovery.
