                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right pleural effusion after right thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The known left apical mass is re-demonstrated.  There is substantial decrease
 in the right pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax.  A pleural
 nodularity consistent with metastatic pleural disease is partially seen on the
 current study.
