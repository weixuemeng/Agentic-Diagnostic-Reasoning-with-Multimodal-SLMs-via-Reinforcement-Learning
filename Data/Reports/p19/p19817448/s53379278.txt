                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and crackles at the right lung base. 
 Evaluate for fluid overload or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules were fully described on recent CT from
 ___.  A left apical soft tissue mass is not significantly
 changed in size compared to recent CT, measuring up to ___.5 cm.  This mass
 causes marked destruction of the posterolateral portions of the left second
 and third ribs, as before.  Smaller right apical nodule with destruction of
 the posterior 4th rib also seen, as before.  A moderate right pleural effusion
 is substantially increased compared to the prior chest radiograph from ___, but was present on recent CT from ___, although a size
 comparison of this effusion between modalities is difficult.  Heterogeneous
 opacities at the right lung base are likely secondary to compressive
 atelectasis, although a concomitant infiltrate cannot be excluded.  There is
 minimal left lower lung atelectasis.  There is no definite left pleural
 effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion, probably not significantly changed
 compared to recent CT from ___.
 
 2.  Right lower lung compressive atelectasis.  Concomitant infection at the
 right lung base cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Bilateral pulmonary nodules and large left apical soft tissue mass with
 adjacent rib destruction, all of which was fully described on the recent CT
 torso report from ___.
