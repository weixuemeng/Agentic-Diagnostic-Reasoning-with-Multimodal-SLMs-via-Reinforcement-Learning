                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath.  Known right pleural effusion. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In comparison to
 the prior exam, the lung volumes are slightly lower.  The small right-sided
 pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.  There is associated right
 basilar atelectasis.  A small left-sided pleural effusion appears stable. 
 There are no new consolidations, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Right upper
 lobe ill-defined focal opacity is unchanged, likely reflective of a
 metastasis. Other previously noted pulmonary nodules are better assessed on
 the prior CT. The cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  A large mass which results in expansile
 destruction of the left second and third ribs is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight increase in size of right pleural effusion and stable small left
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Unchanged osseous metastasis involving the left second and third rib.
