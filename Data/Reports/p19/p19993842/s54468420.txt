                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, assess for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 Frontal portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Examination is
 limited due to patient's body habitus and portable technique.  The lungs are
 low in volume and appear clear with poor evaluation of the retrocardiac
 region.  Moderate cardiomegaly is likely somewhat exaggerated by portable
 technique.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study without acute intrathoracic process.
