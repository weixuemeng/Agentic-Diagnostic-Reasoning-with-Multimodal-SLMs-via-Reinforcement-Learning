                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 Comparison study of ___.
 
 Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the ribs.  With this limitation
 in mind, no acute, displaced right rib fracture is identified, and there is no
 evidence of either pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is diffusely calcified.  Lungs
 are clear except for a small calcified granuloma at the right apex.  No
 pleural effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute, displaced right rib fracture or pneumothorax.  If
 symptoms are localized to a specific rib level, dedicated rib series may be
 considered if warranted clinically.
