                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. 
 Bilateral suprahilar opacities are felt to more likely represent vascular
 structures versus less likely areas of consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Right upper lobe nodular calcifications measuring up to
 5 mm are most consistent with calcified granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral suprahilar opacities may be due to vascular structures,
 although underlying consolidation due to infection is not excluded.
