                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman progressive weight loss, normal labs, normal
 colonoscopy.  // r/o tumor
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The lungs are hyperinflated
 which likely reflect underlying COPD/emphysema. A nodular structure projecting
 adjacent to the right heart border and a left perihilar nodular structure may
 represent en face vasculature though given concern for malignancy, CT
 correlation is advised. \
 
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. There is no
 effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative disease is noted in
 the thoracic spine with large anterior spurs. No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lung and left perihilar nodular opacities, which may represent
 normal vascular structures. Consider CT to further assess.
