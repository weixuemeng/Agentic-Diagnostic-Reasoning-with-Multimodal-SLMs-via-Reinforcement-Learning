                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and knee pain after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Right apical calcifications are unchanged.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with minimal left basilar atelectasis.
