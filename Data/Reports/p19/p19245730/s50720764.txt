                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia, and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is borderline in size. 
 Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic arch.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Parenchymal
 detail is blurred somewhat but there is suspicion for a developing opacity in
 the right upper lung lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination but concern for possible developing pneumonia in the right
 upper lobe.  If feasible clinically, short-term follow-up with standard PA and
 lateral radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
