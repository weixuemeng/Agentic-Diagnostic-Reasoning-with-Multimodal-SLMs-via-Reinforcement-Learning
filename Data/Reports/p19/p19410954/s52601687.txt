                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Small-to-moderate, partially layering right
 pleural effusion is present with adjacent right retrocardiac opacity which
 probably reflects atelectasis, less likely infectious consolidation.  Small
 left pleural effusion is also present, as well as linear left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
