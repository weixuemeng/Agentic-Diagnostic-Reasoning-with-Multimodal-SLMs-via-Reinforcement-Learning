 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement and probably
 coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A right internal jugular venous
 catheter terminates at approximately the confluence of the right internal
 jugular vein with the right subclavian.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is similar volume loss at the left lung base
 with patchy atelectasis.  It is difficult to exclude a pleural effusion on the
 left.  There is no indication of pleural effusion on the right.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular catheter terminating at the confluence of
 the right internal jugular and subclavian veins.  No evidence of acute
 disease.
