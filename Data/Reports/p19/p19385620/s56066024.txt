                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer s/p esophagectomy  // eval
 post op change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had prior median sternotomy with CABG.  A nasogastric tube
 terminates at the level of the GE junction.  An external pacer lead remains in
 place. Right apical chest tube in place with small right apical pneumothorax. 
 There is a small amount of right upper chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. The
 patient has had recent esophagectomy with a small amount of expected
 postoperative pneumopericardium and pneumoperitoneum. Band-like airspace
 opacities at both lung bases and at the periphery of the right lung are most
 likely due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are most likely due to atelectasis given
 improvement on the subsequent radiograph.
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
 
 Small amount of expected postoperative pneumopericardium and pneumoperitoneum.
