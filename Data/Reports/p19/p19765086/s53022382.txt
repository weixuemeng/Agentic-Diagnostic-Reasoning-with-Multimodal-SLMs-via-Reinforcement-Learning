                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left subclavian CVL  // left subclavian CVL
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 03:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, there has been
 interval placement of a new left subclavian line that terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction. Remainder of the support lines and devices are unchanged.
 Endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina.  The enteric tube is
 seen in the stomach, but the tip extends beyond the inferior margin of this
 image. There are two left-sided chest tubes and a left mediastinal drain.
 
 There is a loculated right pleural effusion that has increased since yesterday
 morning's CXR. Additionally, there is slightly worsening opacification of the
 left lung base, which is probably due to a combination of atelectasis and a
 small left pleural effusion.  Interval improvement in extent of underlying
 pulmonary edema since yesterday. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left subclavian line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 2. Interval worsening of loculated right pleural effusion, and a small left
 pleural effusion.
 3.  Pulmonary edema has improved.
