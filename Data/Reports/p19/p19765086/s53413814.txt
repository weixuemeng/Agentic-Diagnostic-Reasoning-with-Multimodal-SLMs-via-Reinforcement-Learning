 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 22:33 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the
 bilateral diffuse airspace and interstitial process which appears to have
 slightly worsened likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema, although a
 worsening pneumonia should also be considered. There are likely layering
 effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. A gastrostomy tube is in
 place. Residual contrast is seen within non-distended transverse colon.
