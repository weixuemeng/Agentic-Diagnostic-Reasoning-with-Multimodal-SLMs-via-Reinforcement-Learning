                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Intubated and respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same afternoon.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable supine.
 
 FINDINGS:   An endotracheal tube has been placed since the prior examination,
 which terminates 3 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses towards
 the stomach.  Its tip not visualized.  The sidehole, however, appears to lie
 slightly above the left hemidiaphragm.  Superimposed on background elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm, there is persistent opacification at the right
 lung base with right infrahilar opacification and suspected pleural effusion. 
 Aeration is much better in the left lower lung, however, which appears better
 expanded with reduction in opacification.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild
 congestion appears similar to slightly decreased with enlarged indistinct
 vessels.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal tube placement; sidehole of orogastric tube
 projecting above the gastroesophageal junction.  The clinician was aware of
 the finding and the tube had apparently been replaced by the time of
 interpretation.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Persistent right basilar opacification suggesting atelectasis associated
 with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and suspected pleural effusion.
 
 4.  Improved aeration of the left lung base.
