                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of metastatic prostate cancer with generalized weakness. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___. CT torso
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Multiple dense opacities
 throughout the lungs correspond to known pleural plaques.  However compared to
 prior studies there appear to be more discrete opacities, particularly in the
 right lung.  This may represent worsening of metastatic disease or infection. 
 The bones are sclerotic compatible with known metastases. Sclerosis in the
 right humerus is again noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Wedging of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies  may have progressed from the
 prior exam, although visualization is obscured by overlying opacities.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Pulmonary opacities, corresponding to known calcified pleural plaques.
 
 2. New opacities particularly in the right lung base may represent metastases
 versus infection.  This can be further clarified by CT as indicated.
 
 3. Diffuse bony metastases with possible new wedging of multiple thoracic
 vertebral bodies.
 , new since ___.
