                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient intubated, check position of endotracheal tube.
 
 CHEST 
 
 The endotracheal tube lies 18 mm from the carinal angle and should be
 re-positioned.  The position of the dialysis catheter and IJ line are
 unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities are again noted and allowing
 for differences in penetration, they are probably unchanged.  Probable cause
 remains pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube 18 mm from carinal angle and should be
 re-positioned.
