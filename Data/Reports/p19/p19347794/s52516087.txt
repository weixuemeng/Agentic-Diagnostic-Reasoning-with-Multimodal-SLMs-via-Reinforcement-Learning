                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A Dobbhoff tube is visualized with its tip at the gastroesophageal junction. 
 Right-sided central dialysis line is noted with the catheter tip at the
 superior cavoatrial junction.  Internal jugular central venous line is noted
 with the tip at the origin of the SVC.  
 
 Again noted at the visualized lung bases are diffuse bilateral heterogeneous
 pulmonary opacities as noted previously and suggestive of edema with possible
 concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 again noted and appear relatively stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dobhoff tube tip is at the gastroduodenal junction.  Heterogeneous pulmonary
 findings suggestive of edema with possible overlying pneumonia or pulmonary
 hemorrhage are again noted.
