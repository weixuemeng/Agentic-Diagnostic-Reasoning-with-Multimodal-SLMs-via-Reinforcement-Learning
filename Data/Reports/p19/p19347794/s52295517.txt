                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased oxygen demand over 12 hours, evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.  Left
 internal jugular central venous line ends at the brachiocephalic junction.  An
 enteric tube ends off the imaged portion of the screen.  There are diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacities which have slightly progressed.  Cardiac
 silhouette is not well assessed.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in bilateral parenchymal opacities may represent
 edema; however, underlying pneumonia is not ruled out.
