                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aphasia, shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  There is patchy
 opacity at the left lung base with new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
 moderate in degree, suggesting coinciding volume loss.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion although it would be
 difficult to detect a subpulmonic pleural effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacity with volume loss at the left lung base which can probably be
 attributed to atelectasis although pneumonia is not excluded.  Short-term
 follow-up radiographs with PA and lateral technique may be helpful to
 reassess.
