 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC enters a left-sided superior vena cava and subsequently
 courses vertically to terminate in the lower left hemithorax, just above the
 level of the diaphragm.  Withdrawal by approximately 8 cm could be performed
 to ensure positioning within the lower left superior vena cava.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  Opacities involving the right middle and right
 lower lobe appear slightly improved and may reflect atelectasis and/or
 infectious consolidation.  Moderate right pleural effusion with subpulmonic
 and intrafissural components is unchanged as well as a small left pleural
 effusion.
