                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with right lower lobe
 effusion developed after CABG, now with suspected recurrence.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior studies, there is reaccumulation of the right pleural
 effusion, at least moderate.  Post-sternotomy wires in a patient with history
 of replaced aortic and tricuspid valve are noted.  There is no evidence of
 failure.  The heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No left pleural effusion
 is noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Note again is made that there is unchanged appearance of displaced fractures
 of first, second, and third ribs on the left.
