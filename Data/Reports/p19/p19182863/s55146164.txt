                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Obstructed renal transplant status post percutaneous nephrostomy got
 5 unita of fresh frozen plasma now with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs ranging from ___ through
 every ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is overall little change compared with prior exam dated ___
 with slight decrease in hazy opacification of the right hemithorax and
 improvement in pulmonary vascular engorgement and small right pleural effusion
 although this could be attributable to upright positioning of the patient
 compared to semi erect positioning on the previous study.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains moderately enlarged.  The right IJ central venous catheter is
 unchanged in position with the tip projecting over the mid SVC.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little change since prior study with slightly improved appearance of the
 vascular congestion and right pleural effusion although this could be due to
 different technique.
