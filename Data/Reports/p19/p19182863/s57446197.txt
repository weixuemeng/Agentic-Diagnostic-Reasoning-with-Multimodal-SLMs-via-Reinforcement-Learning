                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of renal transplant with AFib and increased shortness of
 breath.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left PIC line is unchanged in position compared to the prior
 radiograph.  It enters a left-sided approach and makes a descent at the level
 of the aortic arch in keeping with known left-sided superior vena cava.  There
 is stable mild cardiomegaly.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There has been slight interval improvement of the large right
 pleural effusion associated with atelectasis/consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The replaced valves tricuspid and aortic are redemonstrated. 
 There has been mild improvement of the previously noted interstitial edema. 
 There has been interval improvement in the opacities in the left mid and lower
 lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval improvement in the large right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Improvement in the previously noted bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Stable left lower lung opacities compared to the prior exam.
