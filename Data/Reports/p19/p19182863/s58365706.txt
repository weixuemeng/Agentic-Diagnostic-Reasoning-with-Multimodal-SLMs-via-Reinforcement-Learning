                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve replacement with recent fluid
 resuscitation, here to evaluate for evidence of fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating in the low SVC.  A small caliber left IJ
 line is also noted.  The lung volumes are slightly decreased.  There is slight
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 prominent postoperatively.  There is mild calcification of the aortic knob. 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is increased from the most recent prior
 study.  There is increased streaky opacification at the right lung base
 compared to the most recent prior study.  In the absence of aspiration, this
 most likely reflects atelectasis.  Mild opacification of the left lung base is
 unchanged and compatible with mild atelectasis.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, increased from ___.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis on the right
 greater than the left.
