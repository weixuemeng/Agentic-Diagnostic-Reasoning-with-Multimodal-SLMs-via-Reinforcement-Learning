                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of CABG, presenting
 with chest pain and AFib.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and aortic and tricuspid valve repair.  There
 has been interval development/increase in bilateral, right greater than left,
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Right base opacity may relate
 to effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  Displaced anterolateral left second rib fracture is
 again seen.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase/development of bilateral, right greater than
 left, pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Right base opacity may be
 due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
