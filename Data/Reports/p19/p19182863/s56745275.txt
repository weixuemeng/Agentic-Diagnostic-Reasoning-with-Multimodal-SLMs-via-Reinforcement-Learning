                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with renal allograft and
 Clostridium difficile.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, currently large,
 associated with atelectasis/consolidation.  Interstitial pulmonary edema has
 slightly progressed and there are also new/progressing opacities in the left
 mid and lower lung that might reflect infectious process as well.  The left
 internal jugular line tip is in the persistent left SVC, unchanged in
 appearance.  The replaced valves, tricuspid and aortic are redemonstrated.
