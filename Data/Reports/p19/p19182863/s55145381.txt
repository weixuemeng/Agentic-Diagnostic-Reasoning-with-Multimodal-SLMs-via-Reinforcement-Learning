                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with bronchoscopy, lavage, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left lung lavage was recently done, explaining probably the increased density
 of left middle lung.  There is a small left pneumothorax measuring 3 to 6 mm. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is new.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.  Minor
 fissure on the right side is slightly thickened with an atelectatic band in
 right lower lung.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are moderately enlarged. 
 Aortic knob calcification is unchanged.  Patient had prior sternotomy for
 aortic valve, mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left middle lung increased density is probably related to recent lavage.
 2.  Left apical pneumothorax is small.
 3.  Pulmonary edema is also mild.
