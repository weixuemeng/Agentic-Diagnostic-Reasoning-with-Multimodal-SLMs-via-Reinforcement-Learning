                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with thoracocentesis on ___ and
 questionable left-sided pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Status post thoracotomy, moderate
 cardiac enlargement and evidence of aortic valve prosthesis as well as
 tricuspid valve annuloplasty as before.  The removal of the right-sided
 pleural effusion of the preceding day remains successful as the right-sided
 diaphragmatic contour and pleural sinus is free, demonstrating the pigtail-end
 catheter in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The pulmonary
 vascular pattern again demonstrates perivascular haze throughout which in
 comparison appears slightly increased again.  This may have led to question a
 left-sided pneumonia, a diagnosis which is questionable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent successful status post right-sided thoracocentesis,
 mildly increasing pulmonary congestive pattern with perivascular haze. 
 Diagnosis of left-sided pneumonic infiltrate is questionable unless compelling
 clinical findings are present.
