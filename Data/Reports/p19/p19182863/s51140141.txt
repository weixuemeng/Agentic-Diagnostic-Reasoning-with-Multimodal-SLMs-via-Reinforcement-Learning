                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD, CHF, persistent SOB and DOE  //
 Volume examination
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior study of 1 day earlier, a moderate right pleural effusion
 appears slightly larger, but positional differences may contribute to this
 apparent change.  Partially loculated moderate left effusion is unchanged, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Mild gastric distension in the upper
 abdomen is new.  No other relevant changes.  .
