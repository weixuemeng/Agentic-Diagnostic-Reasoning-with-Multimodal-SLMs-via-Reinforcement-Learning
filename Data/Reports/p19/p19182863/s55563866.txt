                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough. Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there is little change in opacification of the right
 lung base, likely combination of atelectasis and effusion, moderate
 cardiomegaly, and location of pacemaker leads and prosthetic aortic and
 tricuspid valves.  Infection at the right lung base cannot be excluded. There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and small
 right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacification, likely
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
