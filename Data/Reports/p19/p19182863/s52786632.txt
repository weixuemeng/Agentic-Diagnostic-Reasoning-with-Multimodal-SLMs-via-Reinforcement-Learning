                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiographs from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and both mitral and aortic
 valve replacements.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  There is new mild-to-moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which suggests volume loss and a patchy
 opacity in the right lower lobe has increased and is worrisome for pneumonic
 consolidation.  There is probably also some degree of new opacification in the
 right middle lobe.  A vague opacity is also new in the right suprahilar region
 in the right upper lobe, potentially an early focus of pneumonia.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest multifocal pneumonia involving the right lung.
