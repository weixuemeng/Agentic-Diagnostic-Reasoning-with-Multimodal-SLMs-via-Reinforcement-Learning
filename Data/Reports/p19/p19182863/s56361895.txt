                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left-sided pleural
 effusion, assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Right pleural effusion has
 increased in the interim, moderate.  Replaced what appear to be tricuspid and
 aortic valves are redemonstrated.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 left internal jugular line most likely continues into the left SVC given its
 position.  Fracture of the second rib on the left is noted, seen on the
 multiple previous studies.
