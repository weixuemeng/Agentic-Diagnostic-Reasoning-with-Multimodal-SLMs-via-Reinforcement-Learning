                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a linear opacity in the lower lung projecting over the
 middle mediastinum, which is nonspecific and seen on lateral view only, but
 may represent infection.  Linear opacity over the right lower lung likely
 represents linear atelectasis or scarring.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with
 persistent mild cardiomegaly.  Sternal wires and valve hardware are noted.
