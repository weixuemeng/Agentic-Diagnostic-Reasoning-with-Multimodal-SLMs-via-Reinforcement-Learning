                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker/ICD device whose lead terminates
 in the right ventricle as before.  The tricuspid and aortic valves has been
 replaced.  Hazy opacities that are predominantly central within each lung
 suggest mild pulmonary edema.  A persistent pleural effusion with loculated
 character appears unchanged on the right, with probable atelectasis opacifying
 a substantial portion of the right lower hemithorax, as before.  There is
 probably a trace pleural effusion only on the left.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Similar moderate-sized
 right pleural effusion, probably loculated to some extent, with persistent
 lung opacification that can probably be attributed to associated atelectasis.
