                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion,
 followup.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 3:01 a.m.
 
 There has been interval decrease in the right pleural effusion  that could be
 potentially related to  thoracocentesis ?  Post-sternotomy wires are stable as
 well as cardiomediastinal silhouette and replaced tricuspid valve.  Small
 amount of left pleural effusion is most likely present.  Minimal opacity in
 the left lower lung is noted, might potentially be part of the overall
 vascular congestion, attention after diuresis is recommended.
