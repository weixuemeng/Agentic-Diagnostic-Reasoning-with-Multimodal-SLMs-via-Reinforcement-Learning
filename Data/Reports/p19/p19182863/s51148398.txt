 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CAD, renal transplant, dyspnea, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 alignment of the sternal wires.  The valvular replacement is unchanged. 
 Unchanged lung volumes with, however, improved transparency at the lung bases
 and reduction in extent of the pre-existing interstitial opacities.  In the
 lung apices however, signs of minimal basal apical blood flow redistribution
 remain present.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 Minimal dorsal pleural effusions, seen on the lateral radiograph only.
