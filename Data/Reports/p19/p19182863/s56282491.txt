                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEAT RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a small right pleural effusion.  In addition, an area of parenchymal
 opacity at the right lung base has newly appeared.  This opacity is likely
 caused by a basal atelectasis.  Known status post valvular replacement. 
 Normal alignment of sternal wires.  Unchanged left lateral aspect of the
 second rib.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No other acute lung changes.
