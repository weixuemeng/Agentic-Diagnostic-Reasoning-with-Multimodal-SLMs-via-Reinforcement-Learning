                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, known right pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, chest CT
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  There has been interval
 increase in the right pleural effusion, now moderate, with right basilar
 atelectasis.  Mild edema is also seen. There is no pneumothorax. The presence
 of the right pleural effusion limits assessment of the right cardiomediastinal
 contours, but the remainder of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.  Median sternotomy wires are in similar configuration with aortic and
 tricuspid valve replacements.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate, with underlying
 atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema. Repeat chest radiograph after resolution of
 right pleural effusion is recommended to reassess the lungs and mediastinum.
