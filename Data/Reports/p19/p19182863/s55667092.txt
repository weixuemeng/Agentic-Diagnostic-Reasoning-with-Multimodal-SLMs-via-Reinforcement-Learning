                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been a substantial
 increase in the degree of right pleural effusion, which extends upward on the
 frontal view to almost the level of the carina.  There may be mild shift of
 the mediastinum to the left, though there is probably substantial volume loss
 in the right lower lung.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
