                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  A vertebral compression deformity
 in the mid thoracic spine is unchanged from the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
