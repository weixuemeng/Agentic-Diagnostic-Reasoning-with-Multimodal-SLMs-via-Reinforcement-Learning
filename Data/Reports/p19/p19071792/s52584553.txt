                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with
 calcification along the arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 In addition to a very mild diffuse interstitial process, probably vascular
 congestion, there is a focal opacity that includes some tethering to the right
 apical pleural surface with streaky opacities and volume loss, somewhat
 suggestive of chronic scarring.  Right suprahilar opacity appears irregular
 but not very dense, possibly an additional area of scarring, less likely
 pneumonia; however primary neoplasm is also a differential diagnosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality as the suggestive of vascular congestion. 
 Differential considerations may also include atypical pneumonia in the
 appropriate setting.
 
 2.  Focal right suprahilar and right apical peripheral opacities.  These may
 be due to chronic scarring but other etiologies including acute infection or
 even primary neoplasm are not excluded by this study.
 
 Comparison with any prior studies is recommended, if available; otherwise
 short-term follow-up evaluation with chest CT is recommended to reassess.
