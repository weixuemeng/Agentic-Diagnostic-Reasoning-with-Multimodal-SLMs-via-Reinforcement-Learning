                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman presenting s/p fall from standing height with
 pathological non-displaced R lateral mass fracture of C1, found to have
 episodes of asymptomatic SVT now with paroxysmal afib, occasional PVC on tele.
 Now with new leukocytosis.  // pneumonia?   pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Huge midline gastrointestinal hernia, probably through the esophageal hiatus,
 is chronic, responsible for considerable atelectasis at the left base. 
 Considerable right lower lobe atelectasis is also long-standing.  The upper
 lungs are clear.  Heart size is indeterminate but probably not enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
