                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F status post intubation, evaluate tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within the
 stomach.  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental
 atelectasis bilaterally.  Retrocardiac and medial right lung base opacities
 likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted
 in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm from the carina.
 2. Low lung volumes.
