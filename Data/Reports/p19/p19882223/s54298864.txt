                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  ___M with right chest pain, s/p fall onto right side of chest 3
 days ago.  Evaluate for any injuries, pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded without opacities concerning for pneumonia or
 inflammatory process.  Linear atelectasis in the left lung base is present.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural
 effusion pneumothorax. No rib fractures are identified.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No rib fractures are

 fractures.  If there is high clinical concern dedicated rib views should be
 performed.
