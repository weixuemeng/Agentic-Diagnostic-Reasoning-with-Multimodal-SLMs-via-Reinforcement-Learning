 pulmonary vascular congestion in the upper lobes and mild edema most readily
 visible at the right base.  Moderate cardiomegaly is not changed, however. 
 Pleural effusions, if any, are small.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
