 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:18 AM
  Enteric tube tip is probably just at the GE junction, the side port is still
  within the mid to distal esophagus.  Recommend advancing at least 10 cm to
  ensure that the tip and side poor are well within the stomach lumen. 
  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, likely from atelectasis.  Lungs are
  otherwise grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.  Pigtail catheter projects over the
  mid abdomen.  Other drains appear well positioned.
