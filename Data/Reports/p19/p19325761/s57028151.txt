                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with RLQ mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present.  Calcified right lower paratracheal calcified
 lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous disease.  The aorta is densely
 calcified diffusely.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  More
 focal opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Patchy retrocardiac atelectasis.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggest
 prior granulomatous disease.
