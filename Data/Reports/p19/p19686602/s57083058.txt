                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post vaginal delivery after preterm labor and
 chorioamnionitis, now with tachypnea, rule out pneumonia, ARDS.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  No upper zone redistribution or
 evidence of CHF.  No effusion.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  On
 the lateral view, there are some increased markings in the lower lobes --  I
 doubt but cannot entirely exclude an early infiltrate.  No other evidence of
 infiltrate.  No frank consolidation is identified.  No free air is seen
 beneath the diaphragm.
