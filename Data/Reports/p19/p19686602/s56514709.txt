                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib pain, assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  A BB marker indicates the site
 of pain in the left upper quadrant.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 No displaced rib fractures are identified. If there is a clinical basis to
 suspect chest cage trauma and the need to document that radiographically,
 detail views of marked regions of clinical findings should be requested.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
