                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever status post esophageal ring placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A subtle opacity in the left lung base could
 reflect a developing pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Mild blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggests a small effusion.  Heart size is bordelrine and
 aorta is slightly tortuous. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Subtle left basilar opacity, possibly a developing pneumonia.
 2.  Blunting of right costophrenic angle -- ? small effusion vs pleural
 thickening.
