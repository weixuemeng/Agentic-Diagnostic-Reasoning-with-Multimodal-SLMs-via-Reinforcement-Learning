                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a patchy right infrahilar opacity
 within the right lower lobe with suggestion that it may be due to atelectasis,
 although it is not completely specific.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. 
 There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  No pleural or pericardial effusions
 are seen.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy non-specific right infrahilar opacity, which could be seen
 with atelectasis, although the possibility of pneumonia is not excluded in the
 appropriate setting.
