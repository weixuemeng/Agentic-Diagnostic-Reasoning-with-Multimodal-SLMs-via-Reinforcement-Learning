                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___, AT 1:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, question pulmonary
 edema or atelectasis.
 
 Comparison to ___ at1335.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 1:16 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina. 
 Interval worsening of  linear opacity at the right base and more patchy
 opacity at the left base.  These findings may reflect bibasilar atelectasis,
 although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely unchanged, given differences in technique.  Possible small layering
 effusions.  Apparent irregularity of the right fifth anterolateral rib, which
 may be projectional or possibly indicate remote trauma.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.
