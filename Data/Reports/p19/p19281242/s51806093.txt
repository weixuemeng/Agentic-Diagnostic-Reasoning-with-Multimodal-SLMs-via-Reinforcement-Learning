                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with laryngeal carcinoma, undergoing
 chemo and radiation therapy with significant coughing and sputum production
 approaching neutropenia.  Likely large component due to laryngeal lesion, but
 want to rule out underlying pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright
 position are analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 structures are unaltered.  Pulmonary vasculature not congested.  Slightly
 high-positioned diaphragms indicative of poor inspirational effort and
 probably the course of the lateral plate thin atelectasis mostly located in
 dorsal segments of the lower lobes.  These atelectases are new in comparison
 with the previous study, however, there is no evidence of new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates and no pneumothorax has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poor inspirational effort and bilateral plate atelectasis but
 absence of any acute pneumonic infiltrate.
