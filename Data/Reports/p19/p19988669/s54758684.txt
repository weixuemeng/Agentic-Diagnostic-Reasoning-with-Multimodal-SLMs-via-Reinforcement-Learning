                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bike accident.  Please evaluate chest tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right-sided pneumothorax with a chest tube
 traversing medially and terminating along the right mediastinal border.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Note is made of subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall.
 Increased opacities at the mid right lung, is likely secondary to aspiration.
 No acute fracture is identified.  The left lung aside from mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is otherwise clear.  There is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Chest tube in appropriate position with small right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 2. Increased opacities at the mid right lung is likely secondary to
 aspiration. Continued close interval follow up is recommended.
