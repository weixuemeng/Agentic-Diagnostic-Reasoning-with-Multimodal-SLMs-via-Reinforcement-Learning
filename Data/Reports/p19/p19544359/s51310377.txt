                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following placement of a pigtail pleural catheter in the lower
 right hemithorax, a large right pleural effusion has substantially decreased
 in size with residual moderate amount of pleural fluid remaining.  A
 moderate-sized right pneumothorax has developed, with a very small apical
 component but more substantial lateral and basilar component.  The underlying
 lung in the right middle and lower lobes is partially atelectatic, but the
 right upper lobe is relatively well expanded.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are grossly clear. 
 Lytic skeletal lesions are consistent with known metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Decrease in right pleural effusion following pigtail pleural catheter
 placement  and development of a moderate hydropneumothorax.
 
 2.  Lytic rib metastases.
