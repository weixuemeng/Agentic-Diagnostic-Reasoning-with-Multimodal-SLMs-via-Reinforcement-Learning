 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tiny right apical pneumothorax, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural pigtail
 catheter is in unchanged position.  Also unchanged is the extent of the right
 pleural fluid collection and the associated atelectatic right lung changes. 
 On today's image, there is no convincing evidence for right pneumothorax. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the left
 lung.
