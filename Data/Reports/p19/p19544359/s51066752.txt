                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with RCC and pleural effusion status post
 drainage, evaluate for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 14:15.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:01 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar pigtail catheter is seen.  There continues to be a lateral
 and basilar hydropneumothorax with interval decrease in the apical component. 
 Patchy opacity at the right lung base reflects partial atelectasis of the
 right middle and lower lobes.  The left lung remains clear.  There is likely a
 small residual right effusion.  Several lytic bone lesions are seen involving
 the ribs consistent with known metastatic disease.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Radiopaque densities projecting over the
 left upper quadrant are felt to represent artifact.
