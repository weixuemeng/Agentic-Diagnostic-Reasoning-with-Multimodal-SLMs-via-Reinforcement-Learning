                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with known bilateral small
 pneumothoraces and right-sided pleural effusion.  Status post thoracocentesis.
 Evaluate questionable progression of pneumothorax and pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 obtained approximately six hours earlier during the same day.  There is no
 significant interval change between those two portable single view studies. 
 The moderate amount of right-sided pleural effusion persists, and a tiny
 pneumothorax in the apical area cannot be excluded.  A right-sided pigtail
 catheter remains in unchanged position.  In the left hemithorax, also a
 possible small apical pneumothorax exists, but it does not compromise the lung
 which appears reasonably well ventilated.  On the left base, a small drainage
 catheter is identified, similar as on the preceding study.  No new parenchymal
 abnormalities are seen, and the mediastinum has not undergone any significant
 interval change.
