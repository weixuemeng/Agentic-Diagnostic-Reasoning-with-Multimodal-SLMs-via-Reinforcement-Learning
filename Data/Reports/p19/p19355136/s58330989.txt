                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSTEMI, CHF  // Interval change in pulmonary
 edema?      Interval change in pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal limits with now
 only mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The hemidiaphragms are
 sharply seen, which could reflect decreasing pleural effusion, though some of
 the difference may merely be a more upright position of the patient.
 The right IJ catheter is unchanged.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube have been removed.
