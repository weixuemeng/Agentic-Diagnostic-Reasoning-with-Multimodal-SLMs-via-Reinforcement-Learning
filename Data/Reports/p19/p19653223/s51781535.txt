                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 right-sided PICC, terminating in the mid-to-distal SVC.  A larger bore
 right-sided central venous catheter is seen, terminating in the distal SVC. 
 There are diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, which may be
 due to pulmonary edema.  Possible component of chronic interstitial lung
 disease depending on the clinical scenario.  On the lateral view, there is
 slight blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle, which could be due
 to a trace pleural effusion, but no large pleural effusion is seen.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
