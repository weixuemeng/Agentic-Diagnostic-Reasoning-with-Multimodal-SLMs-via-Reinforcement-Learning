                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with BPAD, HIV on HAART with preserved CD4 count
 with continue cough and wheezes on exam s/p URI last week.  // Please evaluate
 for etiology of wheezes.     Please evaluate for etiology of wheezes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.
 Nasogastric tube has been removed. However, the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged and there is no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.
 There is a sharply defined nodular opacification at the left base.  This most
 likely represents a nipple shadow, though a similar opacification is not seen
 on the right. No definite nodules appreciated on the lateral view.
 Nevertheless, a repeat image with nipple marker could be obtained to
 definitely exclude the possibility that this represents a parenchymal lesion.
