                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p Asc aorta replacement  // eval for effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there is a large convex
 mediastinal opacity centered at the aortic-pulmonary window, possibly
 representing a postop mediastinal hematoma or medial loculated fluid
 collection.    Pulmonary edema, bibasilar consolidations, and moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions have improved.  Median sternotomy wires and
 right axillary clips are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large convexity of left mediastinal border adjacent to the aortic knob,
 which may represent a postoperative mediastinal hematoma or medial loculated
 pleural fluid collection.  This could be more fully characterized by CT if
 warranted clinically.
 2.  Interval slight improvement in pulmonary edema, bibasilar consolidations,
 and moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
