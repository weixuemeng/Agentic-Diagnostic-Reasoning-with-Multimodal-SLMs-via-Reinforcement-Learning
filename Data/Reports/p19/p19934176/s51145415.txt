                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior CT torso from ___ as well as a PET-CT
 scan from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known lung cancer with altered mental status, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP semi-upright portable view of the chest was provided. 
 Patient is rotated to her right which somewhat limits the evaluation.  The
 lungs appear clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  There is some prominence of the right paratracheal stripe which
 could reflect mediastinal lymphadenopathy in this patient with known
 metastatic lung cancer.  The heart size appears normal.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen though the left CP angle and the inferior right CP
 angle are excluded.  The imaged osseous structures appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widened mediastinum which could reflect lymphadenopathy in this
 patient with metastatic lung cancer.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.
