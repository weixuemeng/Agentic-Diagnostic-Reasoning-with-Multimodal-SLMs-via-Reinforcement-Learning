                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral views are suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Per the
 radiology technologist, the patient is unable to move arm prior study the
 field of view.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm
 suggesting mild volume loss/atelectasis.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms and with increased AP
 diameter, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Mild biapical
 scarring is noted.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
