                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulm edema and hypertensive emergency. 
 Assess for pulm congestion, fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright chest portable radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ at 02:02, and 03:48.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Perihilar opacity is  due to pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes are lower.Compared
 to the prior radiograph at 03:48, there is increased basal opacification due
 to moderate pleural effusions and dependent edema, though compared to 2:02 ,
 there is no significant change.  The variation over such a short period of
 time is probably due to positioning and level of inspiration. Upper lobe
 vascular congestion and moderate cardiomegaly are stable.
    There is focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate, bilateral pleural effusion and moderate pulmonary edema, unchanged
 from 02:02 on ___.
