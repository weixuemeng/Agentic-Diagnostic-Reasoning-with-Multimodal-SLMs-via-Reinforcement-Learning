                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post left VATS wedge biopsy for interstitial
 lung disease.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal
 contours demonstrate again the trachea takes a tortuous course, although no
 mass is seen on prior CT to account for that deviation.  Instead deviation is
 likely result of severe fibrosis at the right apex.  Fibrosis is also seen at
 the bases bilaterally.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The extent of pulmonary edema has improved compared
 to the most recent prior study.
