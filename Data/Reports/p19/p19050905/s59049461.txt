                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison
 with prior chest radiograph from ___.  Concurrently multiple
 prior chest CTs through ___ to ___ were reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right upper lobe volume loss with bronchiectasis and pleural calcification at
 right lung base is likely from prior granulomatous infection. Bilateral lower
 lobe predominant interstitial opacities are from progressive UIP as suggested
 from concurrent review of chest CTs through ___ to ___.  Mild
 asymmetric pulmonary edema in left lung has improved. Few discrete opacities
 in the left lung are concerning for infection.    Pleural effusion if any, are
 minimal bilaterally.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
