                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric bypass.  Now acute abdominal pain, question free air,
 opacity.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 Possible hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  The heart is not enlarged. 
 There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or gross effusion.  There is slight
 blunting of the left and ? right costophrenic angle posteriorly.   At the
 periphery of these films, fusion hardware in the cervical spine is
 incompletely imaged.
 
 No free air detected beneath the diaphragm.  No dilated loops of bowel are
 identified in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen.  Increased density
 in the splenic flexure of the colon suggests oral contrast. Surgical clips are
 also noted at the level of the diaphragm posteriorly. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) No acute pulmonary process identified.  
 2) No free air detected beneath the diaphragm.
