                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, AP and lateral.  Low lung volume causes crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  There is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis but the
 lungs are otherwise clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged given
 technique.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement but no edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Rightward tracheal
 deviation is chronic and likely secondary to an enlarged thyroid gland.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement but no frank
 edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
