                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with NGT  // NGT placement      NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip projects over the
 gastric body. Lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the cardiac silhouette.
 The left costophrenic angle is not clearly visualized, could be secondary to a
 pleural effusion, atelectasis or could be due to patient's positioning and
 overlying soft tissues. The right costophrenic angle is not included in this
 examination. The upper lung fields are clear. No definite focal consolidation
 identified on this single portable radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
 2.  Low lung volumes. Left costophrenic angle is not clearly visualized, could
 be secondary to atelectasis, pleural effusion or also secondary to patient's
 positioning and overlying soft tissues.
