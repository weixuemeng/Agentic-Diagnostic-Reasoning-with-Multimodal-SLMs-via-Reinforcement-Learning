                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nasogastric tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Lung volumes are lower compared to
 the prior study.  Heart size is accentuated as result of low lung volumes,
 appearing mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is likely due to low
 lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung bases
 most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube tip within the stomach.  Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar
 atelectasis.
