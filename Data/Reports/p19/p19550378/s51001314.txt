                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Polyneuropathy, spiked fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly without overt
 pulmonary edema and mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia. 
 No effusions.  A zone of asymmetrical right apical pleural thickening, partly
 superimposed over the scapula and the clavicle should be closely monitored
 with chest x-ray.
