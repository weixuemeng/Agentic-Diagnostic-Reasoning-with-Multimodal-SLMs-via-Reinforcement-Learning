                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding and
 calcification along the aorta.  The right upper mediastinal contour
 demonstrates a converse contour, which is most frequently seen with tortuosity
 of the great vessels, but not specific.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are
 incompletely characterized along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Convex contour to the right upper
 mediastinum, probably due to tortuosity of great vessels; other etiologies
 such as lymphadenopathy are hard to excluded, however.  If prior films are not
 available to show long-term stability of this appearance, then chest CT is
 suggested in follow-up to assess further.
