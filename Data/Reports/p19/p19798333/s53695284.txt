  1.  Right cardiophrenic opacity is of unclear etiology, and could reflect a
  pericardial abnormality such as a pericardial cyst.  An epicardial fat pad is
  considered less likely.    Follow up chest CT is recommended for further
  evaluation.
  
  2.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
