                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent aspiration pneumonia, continued
 oxygen requirement  // Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 09:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A a right subclavian PICC line is present.  The tip lies in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction, unchanged.
 
 Again seen are extensive predominantly interstitial opacities throughout both
 lungs.  No gross change is identified.  There may be slight increase in the
 degree of opacification in the right mid and infrahilar zones.  Extensive
 lucency at the right lung apex likely reflects extensive bullous change.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No gross effusion is identified,
 though minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is again noted.
