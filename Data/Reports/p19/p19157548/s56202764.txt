                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration pneumonia  // Eval for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval progression of the multifocal airspace opacification which
 previously involved the right middle and lower lung zones as well as the left
 lower lung zone, which now also involves the mid and upper lung zones.  The
 heart size is unchanged.  No significant cephalization of pulmonary blood
 vessels.  No widening of the vascular pedicle.  No large pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific multifocal airspace opacification which shows interval progression
 in distribution.
 
 No interval change in the heart size, pulmonary cephalization or pleural
 effusions to suggest pulmonary edema.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short-term follow-up imaging recommended to evaluate for
 disease progression/resolution.
