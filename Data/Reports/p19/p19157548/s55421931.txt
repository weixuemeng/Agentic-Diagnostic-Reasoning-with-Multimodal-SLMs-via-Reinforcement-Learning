  1. Marked interval increase in bilateral airspace opacities, worst at the lung
  bases, consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia.  Superimposed
  interstitial pulmonary edema is possible in the proper clinical setting.
  2. Left approach PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___,
  M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:10 PM, 45 minutes after discovery of

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with CAP vs. aspiration PNA  // f/u known prior PNA with now
 increasing WBC
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is significant bilateral lower lobe opacification compared to prior,
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  There is increased diffuse
 bronchoalveolar markings.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  There is bilateral pleural effusion.  The left PICC line
 terminates at lower SVC.  No fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Multifocal pneumonia involving the bilateral lower lobes.
 
 2.  Pulmonary edema compared to prior.
