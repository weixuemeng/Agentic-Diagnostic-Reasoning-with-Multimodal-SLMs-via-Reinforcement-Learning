                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased respiratory rate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Decreased lung volumes are noted.  The heart size is normal. The aorta is
 calcified, and the mediastinal contours are normal. 
 
 Persistent right upper lobe volume loss, with >2 cm width of right apical
 pleural thickening and reticulonodular parenchymal opacities.
 
 Subtle new right basilar opacity is also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right apical pleural and parenchymal abnormalities may be the sequelae of
 prior granulomatous or other infectious process, but it is difficult to
 exclude an active process (reactivation TB or scar carcinoma) without more
 remote radiographs for comparison. CT is recommended for further
 characterization.
 
 2. Subtle right basilar opacity, which could reflect aspiration, atelectasis
 or early pneumonia.
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 11:39am on
 ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
