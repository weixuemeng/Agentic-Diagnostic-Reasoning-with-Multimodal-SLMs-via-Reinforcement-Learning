                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right basal ganglia hemorrhage, now febrile with tachypnea and
 fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior study
 demonstrates continued elevation of left hemidiaphragm with left basilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Scarring in
 the right apex is of unclear etiology and may be a sign of prior tuberculosis
 infection or post-radiation fibrosis.  No pleural abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis with pulmonary vascular congestion and no evidence of
 developing pneumonia.
 
 2. Right apical scarring which is of unclear etiology. Correlation with prior
 imaging is recommended and if not available, CT of the chest can be obtained
 for further evaluation.
