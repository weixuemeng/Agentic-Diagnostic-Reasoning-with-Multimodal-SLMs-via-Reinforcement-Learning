                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary
 edema.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Streaky atelectasis is noted in the lung
 bases without focal consolidation.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly on the lateral view may reflect the presence of trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present, and there is no focal
 consolidation.  Mild moderate multilevel degenerative changes are present in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
