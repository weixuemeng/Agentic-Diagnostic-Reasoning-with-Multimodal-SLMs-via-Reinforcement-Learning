 Lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal hilar
 and mediastinal structures.  No evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.  A very subtle linear soft tissue density paralleling the

 Exclusion of a potential other structure should be performed with a lordotic
 view.
