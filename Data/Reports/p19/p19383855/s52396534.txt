                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of resected atypical carcinoid and FDG-avid
 left lower lobe pulmonary nodule seen on ___ PET-CT exam.  The patient
 now presents with cough and fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  CT chest of ___ and PET-CT exam of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.  The
 AP diameter of chest is expanded, suggestive of underlying chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
 pneumothorax.  Reticular opacities are noted in the right lung base.  Hilar
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Mild
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is seen with associated degenerative
 changes.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperexpanded lung, suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Right lung base opacities may represent atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
