                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a
 patchy new opacity in the right lower lobe suggesting pneumonia, probably
 better appreciated on the lateral than frontal view.  A moderate anterior
 wedge compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears probably
 chronic, but was probably not present on the prior radiographs noting that
 loss in height is apparent on the frontal view on this study but not on the
 prior one.  However, a previous lateral view is not available for optimal
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia.
 
 2.  New mild-to-moderate anterior wedge compression deformity, probably new
 since the prior study, but unlikely to represent an acute finding; correlation
 with clinical history is recommended.
