 Chest: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There are endplate degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine and a mild dextroconvex curvature in the upper thoracic spine.
 
 Neck:  The contours of the aerodigestive tract are unremarkable.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, including minimal
 retrolisthesis at C3-C4 and C4-C5, and bilateral uncovertebral spurring from
 C4-C5 through C6-C7.
