                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with hypoxia and liver failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA abdomen from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an opacity at the right lung base with silhouetting of the
 right hemidiaphragm likely representing small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  However, a developing pneumonia in this
 region cannot be excluded.  Additionally, there is a small left pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The upper lung zones are
 clear.  There are no acute fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and
 small on the left, with adjacent airspace atelectasis. Pnuemonia must be
 excluded in the proper clinical setting.
