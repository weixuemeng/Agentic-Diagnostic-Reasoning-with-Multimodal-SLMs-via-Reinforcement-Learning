                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post recent aortic valve replacement, now
 with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Per
 technologist, the patient was unable to raise arms for lateral view due to
 recent surgery.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval improved aeration at the left lung base. 
 No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Mild
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be secondary to small effusion or
 scarring.  Lung volumes are slightly low, which may exaggerate heart size;
 heart and mediastinal contours appear stable with mild cardiomegaly.  Median
 sternotomy wires are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration at the left lung base without evidence for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
