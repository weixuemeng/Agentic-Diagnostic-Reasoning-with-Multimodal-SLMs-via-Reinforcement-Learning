                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with lordotic positioning.  Compared with
 ___ at 12:01, the ET tube, NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and multiple
 tubes/mediastinal drains have been removed.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy, with stable or slightly improved prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac density
 with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion.  Although the edge of
 the right lung apex is visualized, no frank right or left pneumothorax is
 detected.  The right lung is grossly clear, without infiltrate or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval removal of lines and tubes.  Doubt pneumothorax.
 2) Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.
 3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion,
 unchanged.
