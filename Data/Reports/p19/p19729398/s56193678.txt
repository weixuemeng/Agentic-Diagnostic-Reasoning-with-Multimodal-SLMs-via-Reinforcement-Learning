                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R loculated pleural effusion  // s/p R
 sided chest tube      s/p R sided chest tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 15:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right basilar pigtail pleural catheter.
 No pneumothorax is seen.  However, there is persistent near complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax which likely represents a combination of
 a known hilar mass, consolidated lung, and pleural collection.  This is better
 evaluated on the recent chest CT.  Patchy heterogeneous opacities in the left
 lower lung and lingula are better appreciated on the CT but are concerning for
 pneumonia.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a
 small effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Single lead left-sided pacer unchanged in
 position.  Status post median sternotomy with valve replacement.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours cannot be adequately assessed due to marked patient
 rotation and near complete opacification of the right hemithorax.
