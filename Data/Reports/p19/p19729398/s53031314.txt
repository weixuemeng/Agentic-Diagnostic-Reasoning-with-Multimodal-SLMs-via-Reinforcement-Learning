 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Lung adenocarcinoma, status post talc pleurodesis and biopsy,
 questionable persistent pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apical
 pneumothorax is not substantially changed.  The two right-sided chest tubes
 are in unchanged position.  An area of collapsed lung in the paramediastinal
 right regions is constant in extent and severity.  The left lung is also
 constant in appearance.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
