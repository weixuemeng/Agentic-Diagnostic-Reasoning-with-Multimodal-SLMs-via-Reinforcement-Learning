                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post bronchoscopy and
 endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy.  Assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy and the metallic component of a
 porcine valve prosthesis is identified in mitral valve position.  Cardiac
 enlargement is very mild, but the left atrial contours are identified both in
 frontal and lateral view and suggests mild enlargement of the left atrium. 
 Pulmonary vasculature, however, is not congested and no signs of acute
 infiltrates are present.  Rather low positioned and somewhat flattened
 diaphragms are noted, coinciding with increased translucency of the lung bases
 suggestive of some degree of COPD.  There is no evidence of any pleural
 effusion and no signs of pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post mitral valve replacement.  No evidence of significant
 pulmonary congestion.  No signs of pneumothorax but some general pulmonary
 findings suggestive of COPD.
