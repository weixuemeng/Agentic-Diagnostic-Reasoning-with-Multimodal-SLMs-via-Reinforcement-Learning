                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lung cancer, last chemotherapy/radiation today,
 increasing dyspnea on exertion/shortness of breath, recently treated with
 Levaquin for post-obstructive pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Elevation of
 the minor fissure indicating volume loss, may be slightly increased.  Right
 upper lung opacity is again seen, although slightly less confluent as compared
 to the prior study.  Known right upper lobe mass widenes the mediastinum,
 although to a lesser extent.  There is a small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion and a small possible trace left pleural effusions with overlying
 bibasilar atelectasis.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 cardiac valve replacement.  Left base opacity has also decreased in the
 interval.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.
