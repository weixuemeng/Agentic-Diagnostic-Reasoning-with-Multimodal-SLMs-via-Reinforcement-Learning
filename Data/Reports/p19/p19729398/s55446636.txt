                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Combined alveolar and interstitial opacities in the left mid and
 lower lung have worsened, and may be due to provided history of pulmonary
 hemorrhage, but differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical edema and
 pulmonary infection.  Post-radiation changes in the right lung appear similar
 to the recent study with associated volume loss and loculated right apical
 effusion and/or thickening.  Moderate, partially loculated right pleural
 effusion and a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
