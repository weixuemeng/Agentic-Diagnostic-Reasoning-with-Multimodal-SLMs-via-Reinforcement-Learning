                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and hemoptysis.  Patient has a history of non-small
 cell lung cancer and is on chemotherapy.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires as well as a prosthetic mitral valve noted.  There is
 extensive scarring within the right lung with similar overall pattern compared
 with the prior imaging studies and a small loculated right pleural effusion is
 again seen.  Otherwise, the lungs remain clear without evidence of pneumonia
 or CHF.  No left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with extensive scarring in the
 right lung due to radiation fibrosis better assessed on prior CT with small
 right pleural effusion, loculated appearing stable.
