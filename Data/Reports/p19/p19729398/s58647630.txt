                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer status post pleurodesis, now with
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs redemonstrate a chronically collapsed
 right upper lobe, which is secondary to radiation.  The right apical
 pneumothorax is decreased.  The right chest tube has been removed.  There is a
 small residual loculated right pleural effusion.  The left lung demonstrates
 improved aeration and is clear, without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart size is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Decreased right apical pneumothorax and a small residual loculated right
 pleural effusion.
