                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mild calcification of the aortic knob is present.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Relative lucency within the right lung base likely reflects bullous
 emphysematous changes.  Linear opacities within the left lung base may reflect
 scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient's forearm obscures
 visualization of the left costophrenic angle.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat limited exam.  Bullous emphysema.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
