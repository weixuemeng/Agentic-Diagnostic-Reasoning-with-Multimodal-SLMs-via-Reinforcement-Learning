 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube has its tip projecting over the stomach in satisfactory
 position.  Lung volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities which could
 reflect atelectasis and at least a small right layering effusion.  A
 superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
