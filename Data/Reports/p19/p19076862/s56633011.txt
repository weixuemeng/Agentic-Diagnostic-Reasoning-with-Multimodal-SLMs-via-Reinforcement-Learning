                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F h/o SBR with primary anastomosis ___ yrs ago in Fl, p/w
 complete SBO, transition point at prior anastomosis s/p ex lap sbr of previous
 strictured anastamosis  // assess possible explanation for increasing O2
 requirement    assess possible explanation for increasing O2 requirement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Loss of volume and consolidation have increased at both lung bases, suggesting
 aspiration, leading to pneumonia and atelectasis.  The upper lungs are clear. 
 Borderline enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is attributable differences
 in radiographic technique and lower lung volumes rather than developing
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal vasculature however is probably distended
 responsible for increased caliber of the supra cardiac mediastinum.  Ascending
 thoracic aorta and aortic arch are heavily calcified but not clearly dilated. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  No pneumothorax.  Esophageal
 drainage tube ends in the upper stomach.
