                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  The central pulmonary vasculature appears mildly engorged. 
 There is left basilar atelectasis.  Minimal opacity is seen in the right
 infrahilar region and at the left base.  No definite correlate is seen on the
 lateral view, however, in the appropriate clinical context, this may represent
 focal pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right infrahilar and left basilar opacity, in the appropriate clinical
 context, may represent pneumonia.
