                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hepatocellular carcinoma and duodenitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Tiny bilateral pleural effusions seen best on the lateral view are new, not
 necessarily of any clinical significance.  Lungs are clear, and the heart size
 is normal.  An infusion port ends in the low SVC.
 
 ABDOMEN:  Two frontal views of the abdomen, upright and supine, show no
 distention of large or small bowel.  Although the left colon is not distended
 with formed stool, there is more than the general amount of formed stool in
 the right colon suggesting some chronic constipation.  No free
 subdiaphragmatic gas or mass effect.  The spleen is enlarged.  Granulomatous
 calcifications in the liver are longstanding.
