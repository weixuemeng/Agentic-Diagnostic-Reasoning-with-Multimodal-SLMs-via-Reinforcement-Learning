                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided sharp chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or a
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal airspace consolidation.  A linear
 opacity at the left lung base is unchanged, likely reflecting scarring.  The
 heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. 
 Kyphoplasty changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
