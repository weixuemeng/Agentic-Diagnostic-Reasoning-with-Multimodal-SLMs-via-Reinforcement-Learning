 HISTORY:  Persistent cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small foci of linear scarring are seen in the right middle and left lower
 lobes.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema identified.  A stable, mild area of indentation is seen along
 the right lateral aspect of the trachea, likely secondary to the patient's
 known enlarged thyroid.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Redemonstrated are several thoracic vertebroplasties,
 unchanged and appearance from the prior examination.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for acute pulmonary process.
