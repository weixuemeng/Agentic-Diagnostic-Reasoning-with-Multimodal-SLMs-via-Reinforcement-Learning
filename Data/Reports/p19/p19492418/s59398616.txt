                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sepsis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob noted.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Low lung volumes are noted.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may be due to the atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  Small
 right pleural effusion is decreased in size compared to the previous study. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, potentially atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Trace right pleural effusion, decreased in size compared to the previous
 study.
