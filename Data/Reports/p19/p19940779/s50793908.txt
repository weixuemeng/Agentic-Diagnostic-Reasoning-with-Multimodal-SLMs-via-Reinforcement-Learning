                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // r/o infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal heart size, and hilar contours.  There is an opacity in the
 retrosternal space on the lateral view, though this is not a true lateral view
 and could be related to technique.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the retrosternal space on the lateral view, potentially related to
 suboptimal positioning.  Repeat lateral radiograph is recommended to help
 exclude an anterior mediastinal abnormality such as a thymoma.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend non emergent repeat lateral radiograph with
 improved position to evaluate the retrosternal clear space.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The updated findings and recommendations were emailed to the ED
 QA nurses by Dr. ___ on ___
