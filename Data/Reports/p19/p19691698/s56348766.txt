 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:46 PM
  A questioned 7 mm density projecting over the left posterior sixth rib may
  represent overlying structures or may be outside the patient.  Correlation
  with the patient's site of pain and further evaluation with an oblique chest
  radiograph should be considered.  Otherwise, no findings to explain the
  patient's pain.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radio
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // ?PNA ?PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly lordotic positioning.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 A subtle 7 mm rounded density projects over the posterior left seventh rib, in
 the left mid zone laterally.  This is not definitively identified on lateral
 view, but could correspond to a focal density projecting over the cardiac
 silhouette anterior to the hila.  No other focal nodular densities are
 identified.  No rib fracture is detected on these lung technique films.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process is identified.  In particular, no pneumothorax or
 pneumonic infiltrate is identified.
 
 Note is made of a 7 mm nodular density in the left mid zone laterally,
 equivocally visualized on the lateral view.  Further assessment with chest CT
 is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT for further evaluation of a 7 mm nodular density
 in the left mid zone laterally.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 22:47 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
