                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New feeding tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for
 comparison.  
 
 An enteric tube is present.  The radiopaque tip overlies the gastric fundus.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, there is probable
 prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, with upper zone
 redistribution.  There is atelectasis at both lung bases, with patchy opacity
 in the retrocardiac region. Possible minimal blunting of both costophrenic
 angles.  Correlation with any specifics of the patient's clinical situation
 would be relevant to further interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enteric-type tube with radiopaque tip overlying gastric fundus.
