                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  There is heterogeneous opacification in each mid
 to lower lung and each hilum is mildly enlarged.  This is probably due to
 enlargement of pulmonary vessels in association with mild vascular congestion.
 Confluent opacification obscuring the left cardiac border suggests pneumonia
 in the lingula, although pneumonia might not be confined to this area.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the appropriate, most well defined in the
 lingular region, with coinciding suspicion for mild vascular congestion.
