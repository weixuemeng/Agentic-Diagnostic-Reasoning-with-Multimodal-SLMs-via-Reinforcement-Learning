                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple comorbidities presenting with
 ventricular tachycardia.  Assess interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube remains in good position.  There is an upper alimentary
 tube whose tip is not seen, but appears to be coiled towards its distal end. 
 Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities are much improved on this study, but
 slight increased markings in the bilateral upper lobes and the right lower
 lobe are still present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Almost complete resolution of bilateral diffuse airspace
 opacifications consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
