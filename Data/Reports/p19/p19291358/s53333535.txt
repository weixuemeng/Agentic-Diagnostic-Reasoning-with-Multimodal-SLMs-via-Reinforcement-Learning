                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male recently intubated.  Evaluate for position of
 endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral diffuse airspace opacities, with more confluent
 consolidations in the lung bases. A nodular component cannot be excluded.
 Assessment of the pleural sulci is limited as both were left out of the
 imaging frame.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen ending 4.8 cm above the carina.  There is no
 cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Severe diffuse bilateral airspace opacities might represent pulmonary
 edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or widespread infection. Further assessment with
 chest CT is recommended. 
 2.  Endotracheal tube ending 4.8 cm above the carina.
