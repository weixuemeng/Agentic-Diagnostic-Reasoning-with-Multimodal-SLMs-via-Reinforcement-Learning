                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resting tachycardia, O2 sat ___% at rest,
 recent hospitalizations in ___ and again in ___ for pericarditis with
 tamponade s/p paracardiocentesis, and bilateral pleural effusion s/p drainage
 with chest tubes (removed).  // please compare with latest CXR from ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 CTA chest on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are similar in size to the prior chest radiograph on
 ___.  Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left, appear minimally
 increased which may reflect atelectasis or infection.  Of note there is
 engorgement of the azygos vein, increased from the prior examination.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left bilateral pleural effusion is not significantly increased from
 ___.  Right-sided effusion may be minimally increased.  Bibasilar
 opacities, greater on the left may reflect compressive atelectasis or
 infection in the appropriate setting.
 
 New engorgement of the azygos vein could reflect elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure or tamponade phenomenon.
