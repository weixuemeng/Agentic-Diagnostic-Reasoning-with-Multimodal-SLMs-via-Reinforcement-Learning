                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history pericarditis and bilateral pleural effusions
 presents with HA and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  Bibasilar opacities are noted which could represent atelectasis
 and/or pneumonia.  Opacity at the right lung base appears slightly progressed
 from the prior radiograph.  There is blunting of the right CP angle likely
 reflecting a small pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  No pneumothorax.  Crowding of bronchovascular markings at the
 perihilar region limits evaluation for congestion.  No overt edema.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion.
