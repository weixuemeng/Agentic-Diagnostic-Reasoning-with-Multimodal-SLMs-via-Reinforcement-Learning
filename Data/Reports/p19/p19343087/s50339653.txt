                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with pericarditis p/w bilateral acute pleural effusions after
 pulling pericardial drain, now s/p bilateral chest tube placement  // Assess
 chest tube placement and change in effusion sizes     Assess chest tube
 placement and change in effusion sizes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extremely low lung
 volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Bilateral
 chest tubes are in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 There is increasing indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, which could reflect
 some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.  Atelectatic changes are
 increased bilaterally at the bases, especially in the retrocardiac region. 
 This latter opacification could well represent superimposed pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
