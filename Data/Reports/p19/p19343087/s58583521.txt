                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and persistent wheezing x 5 days.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Aside from the
 previously noted hiatal hernia and minimal venous engorgement, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Low lung volumes results in vascular
 crowding, but the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
