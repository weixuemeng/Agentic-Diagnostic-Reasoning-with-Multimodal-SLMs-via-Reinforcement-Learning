                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post renal transplant and
 pleural effusions, evaluate pockets of effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  PA and lateral chest views with patient in upright position demonstrate
 mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without typical configurational
 abnormality.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no
 evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  The previously identified
 bilateral pleural effusions have regressed markedly.  There remains a mild
 degree of right-sided pleural effusion obliterating the lateral half of the
 diaphragmatic contour and filling the lateral pleural sinus.  This extends
 into the posterior pleural sinus.  On the other hand, evidence of left-sided
 pleural effusion has disappeared completely with clear delineation of the
 diaphragmatic contour and sharp delineation of both lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses which indicates absence of any remaining fluid.  No new acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified, and the apical areas do
 not show any pneumothorax.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are quite
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked regression of pleural effusions with small right-sided
 pleural effusion remaining.  Also, the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 has regressed markedly.
