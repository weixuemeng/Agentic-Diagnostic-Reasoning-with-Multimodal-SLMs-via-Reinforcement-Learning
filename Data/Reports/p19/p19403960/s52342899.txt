                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusions, status post
 thoracocentesis, evaluate for pneumothorax and interval change in pleural
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study dated ___.  Previously described cardiac enlargement appears
 unchanged.  The same holds for the previously described right internal jugular
 approach central venous line terminating in the lower SVC.  Successful
 right-sided thoracocentesis has resulted in elimination of right-sided basal
 effusion, now with clear visibility of diaphragmatic contours.  The pulmonary
 vasculature in the right hemithorax does not appear congested, and there is no
 evidence of a post-procedure pneumothorax in the apical area.  On the left
 side, the previously described pleural effusion obscuring the diaphragmatic
 structures remains rather unchanged.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful thoracocentesis with removal of pleural effusion in
 right hemithorax and absence of post-interventional pneumothorax.  Estimate of
 pleural effusion based on single view observation is between 750 to ___ mL.
