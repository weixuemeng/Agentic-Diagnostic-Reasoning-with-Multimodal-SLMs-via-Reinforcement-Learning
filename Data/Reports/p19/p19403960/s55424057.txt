 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion with drain in place.
 
 CHEST 
 
 Cardiac size remains enlarged.  The position of the pericardial drain is
 unchanged.  Bilateral effusions are present, somewhat larger than they were on
 the prior chest x-ray of ___, which is more marked on the left.
 
 Some opacities are seen in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.  These
 could represent areas of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing effusion, particularly on the left.  Patchy opacities,
 possibly representing pneumonia.
