 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ at 10:37.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present which is partially
 attributable to the presence of a moderate pericardial effusion.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There are bilateral
 pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and small on the left. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is also seen, more pronounced within the right lung
 base.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and small on the
 left with bibasilar atelectasis.  Moderate size pericardial effusion, better
 assessed on the chest CT obtained earlier in the day.
