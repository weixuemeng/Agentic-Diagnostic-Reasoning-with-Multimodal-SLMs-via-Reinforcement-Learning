                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with productive cough for four days.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small cluster of irregular opacities, some nodular, some bronchial thickening,
 in the axillary region of the right upper lung is new since ___, but is not
 necessarily acute.  These findings are most commonly seen with chronic mild
 bronchiectasis often due to nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.  There are
 no findings sufficient to suggest pneumonia.  Pleural effusions are tiny if
 any.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Heart size is normal.  As before, trachea
 is deviated to the left at the thoracic inlet, most likely due to a large
 right-sided goiter.
