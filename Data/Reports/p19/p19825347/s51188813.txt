                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pneumonia followup examination.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal with unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contour.  A new nodular opacity in the left lower lung is visible only on the
 PA projection without a lateral correlate and is likely extrathoracic.  Again
 appreciated is bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and slight
 nodular opacities particularly in the right upper lung unchanged from prior
 exam.  Persistent leftward deviation of the trachea at the level of thoracic
 inlet is likely due to goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Nodular opacity  projecting over the left lung base, visible only on the PA
 view, is likely extrathoracic.  If symptoms persist, the exam may be repeated
 with careful disrobing along with a check by radiologist to ensure exam
 adequacy.
 
 2. Chronic bronchiectasis.
