 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the immediate prior study of ___, the small to
 moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Increasing opacification of
 the right lung base in the absence of clinical signs of pneumonia likely
 represents right middle lobe collapse.  There may be a small left pleural
 effusion.  The heart is top normal in size and unchanged.  The right-sided
 chest wall port catheter tip ends in the low SVC. There is no pulmonary edema.

 1. Unchanged small to moderate right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Increased right basilar opacification, likely representing right middle
 lobe collapse.
