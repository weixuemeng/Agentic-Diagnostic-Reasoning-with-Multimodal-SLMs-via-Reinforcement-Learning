                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumothorax, pls eval interval change  //
 Pls eval interval change in pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for changes in positioning, the small to moderate right apical
 pneumothorax may be slightly larger. Right base opacification is improved
 compared with earlier on the same day, making infectious etiologies very
 unlikely. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no focal
 consolidation or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Allowing for changes in positioning, the small to moderate right apical
 pneumothorax may be slightly larger.
 2. Improved right base opacification, compatible with resolving atelectasis.
