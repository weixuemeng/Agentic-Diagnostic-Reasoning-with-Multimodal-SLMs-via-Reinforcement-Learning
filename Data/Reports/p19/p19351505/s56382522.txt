                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumothorax. Please evaluate for any
 interval change in pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest from ___ at
 00:08 and 04:28.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study of 00:08 shows no appreciable change in the small to moderate right
 apical pneumothorax. However, right basilar subsegmental atelectasis and
 surrounding airspace opacification has increased. The heart and mediastinum
 are magnified by the projection. A right pectoral Infuse-A-Port is unchanged
 in position. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a new
 small pleural effusion.
 
 The followup exam from ___ hr shows worsening right middle and right lower
 lobe airspace opacification superimposed on subsegmental atelectasis.
 Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. The small to moderate
 right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. There is stable left retrocardiac
 linear atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable small to moderate right apical pneumothorax.
 
 Two successive radiographs show right basilar subsegmental atelectasis with
 increasing airspace opacities, which may be due to superimposed infection or
 atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
