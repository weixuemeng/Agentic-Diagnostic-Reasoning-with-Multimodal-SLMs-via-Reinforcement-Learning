                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy with fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Postsurgical changes are noted in the right upper lobe.  Previously visualized
 tiny right apical pneumothorax is no longer clearly identified.  The right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated and there has been minimal increase in right
 lower lobe opacities likely representing a combination of small pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  However, an overlying infection cannot be
 excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette structures remain stable.  The
 left hemithorax is clear.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacities at the right lung base likely representing a small pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  However, the overlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded.
