                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  EKG changes and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Popcorn-like
 calcification is seen along the right paratracheal region of unclear etiology.
 Recommend correlation with prior studies to assess stability, if none,
 nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.  Anterior, inferior right upper
 lobe linear atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Area of amorphous calcification spanning approximately 6 cm
 projecting over the right paratracheal region, of unclear etiology.  Recommend
 correlation with any prior radiograph to assess for stability, if none,
 nonurgent chest CT would help further evaluate.
