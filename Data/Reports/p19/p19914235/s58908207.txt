                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided shaking and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  Mild unfolding and calcification are noted along
 the aorta.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Although there is no focal opacity, the interstitium is mildly
 prominent suggesting slight fluid overload.  A crowding of interstitial
 markings suggests atelectasis associated with low lung volumes and mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  A severe lower thoracic compression
 deformity includes nearly complete collapse of the vertebral body and mild
 retropulsion, of uncertain chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality suggesting slight fluid overload.
 
 2.  Crowding of right basilar lung markings, more suggestive of minor
 atelectasis than pneumonia.  However, if pneumonia is a persistent clinical
 concern, then short-term followup radiographs may be helpful, preferably with
 PA and lateral technique, if possible.  
 
 3.  Severe lower thoracic compression deformity, age-indeterminant on
 radiography, but with not clear indication of recent chronicity.  Correlation
 with clinical presentation and findings is suggested.
