                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated, transfer.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is
 approximately 3.2 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the inferior
 field of view, tip not clearly identified.  Relatively low lung volumes are
 noted with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Lungs are grossly clear.
 The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but this is likely accentuated due to
 technique and low inspiratory effort.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
