 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There has been
 interval resolution of the streaky linear opacities in both lung bases on the
 prior study consistent with resolved atelectasis.  Lungs are now without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions or pulmonary edema.  Old left-sided healed rib fractures again
 identified.  No pneumothorax.
