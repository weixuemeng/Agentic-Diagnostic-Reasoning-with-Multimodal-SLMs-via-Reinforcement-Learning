                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there again are streaks of
 atelectasis at the bases, less prominent than previously on the right.  On the
 lateral view, there is an area of increased opacification in the retrocardiac
 region.  Although this may merely reflect confluent atelectasis, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 The left subclavian catheter has been removed.  No evidence of vascular
 congestion.
