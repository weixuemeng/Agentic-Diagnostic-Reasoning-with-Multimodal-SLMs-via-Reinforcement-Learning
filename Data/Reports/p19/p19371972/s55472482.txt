                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain and fever of unknown origin.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  Change in shape since ___ of the large
 crescentic opacity in the left lower lobe, new since ___, shows it is
 largely atelectasis. Right lower lobe opacification is more likely atelectasis
 than pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe may represent atelectasis;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis could be fever souce. 
 
 3.  This study does not speak to the possibility of acute pulmonary embolus.
