 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right chest wall

 projecting over the right lower lung on the frontal view, which is most likely
 a nipple shadow.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified noting multiple posterior left rib fractures, which appear old.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  1-cm nodular opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung, potentially nipple shadow.  However,
 given patient's history of malignancy, followup with nipple marker is
 suggested to confirm.
