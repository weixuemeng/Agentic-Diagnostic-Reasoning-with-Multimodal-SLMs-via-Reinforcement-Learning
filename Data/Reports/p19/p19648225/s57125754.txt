                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is patchy opacification of
 the left lower hemithorax with a suspected pleural effusion, possibly moderate
 in size.  There is a lesser degree of opacification in the left lower lung,
 largely streaky and probably due to minor atelectasis or scarring, although
 there may also be a small pleural effusion potentially on the left side.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic spine.  There is also
 mild rightward convex curvature and a moderate thoracolumbar compression
 deformity, incompletely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  In addition to true enlargement of the myocardium,
 the possibility of a pericardial effusion could be considered.
 
 2.  Basilar opacification, greater on the right than left with a suspected
 pleural effusion, at least on the right side.
 
 3.  Moderate thoracolumbar compression deformity.
