                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There
 is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.
 Increased opacity within the retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with retrocardiac opacity, likely reflective of atelectasis.
 Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
