                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent upper endoscopy for a gastrojejunal stricture, presenting
 with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery
 bypass graft surgery.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is mildly prominent, suggesting mild vascular congestion.  There
 is a small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the right, but decreased. 
 Subpulmonic opacification of the left lung base is not well delineated but may
 indicate a small effusion and atelectasis.  The bones appear demineralized. 
 The right acromiohumeral interval is effaced.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion, somewhat decreased, and findings
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Although pneumonia at the one
 or both lung bases is difficult to exclude, findings are more suggestive of
 mild congestive heart failure than infection.
