                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, stridor and dyspnea.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON: CT Neck ___. Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal AP chest radiograph demonstrates mild tracheal
 narrowing at the thoracic inlet unchanged since CT 2 days prior. The lungs are
 fully expanded and clear.  No retrocardiac opacity.  The pleural surfaces are
 normal without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The costophrenic
 angles are not fully included on this study.  Heart size, mediastinal contour
 and hila are otherwise unremarkable.  Visualized osseous structures are
 notable for a surgical screw in the left scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Narrowing of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet is unchanged
 since CT 2 days prior.
 2.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumonia.
