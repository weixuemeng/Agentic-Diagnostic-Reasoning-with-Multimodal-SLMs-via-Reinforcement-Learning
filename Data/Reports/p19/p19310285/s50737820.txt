 INDICATION:  Status post cervical tracheal resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT trachea ___.
 
 FRONTAL PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A moderate right pneumothorax is seen.  No
 left pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding with
 linear atelectasis in the left mid lung. There may be a small amount of right
 pneumomediastinum. No pleural effusion is identified.  Heart size is top
 normal allowing for lung volumes.  Mediastinum is widened but not signifcantly
 changed from preoperative CT appearance. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pneumothorax and possible right pneumomediastinum.
