                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal resection, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study, there has been almost
 complete re-expansion of the right hemithorax.  Small areas of opacification
 in the right mid zone could reflect post-expansion edema.
