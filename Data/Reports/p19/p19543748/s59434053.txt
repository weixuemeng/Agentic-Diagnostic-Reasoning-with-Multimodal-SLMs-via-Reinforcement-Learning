 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic renal cell
 cancer, admitted for HD interleukin 2 therapy, currently with respiratory
 distress.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is newly developed bilateral perihilar predominantly upper lobe, but
 also to a lesser extent lower lobe opacities, though given their distribution
 a most likely concern for pulmonary edema.  Element of underlying infection
 can be present, but most likely not represent the main reason for the
 abnormality.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
 Partial right upper lobe atelectasis is present
