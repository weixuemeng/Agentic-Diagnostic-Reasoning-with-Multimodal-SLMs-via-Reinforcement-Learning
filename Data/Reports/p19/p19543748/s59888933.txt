                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // eval for pna      eval for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an increase in the
 size and number of pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases. There has
 been the development of increased opacification at the left base with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle. Although this could
 merely reflect volume loss and pleural effusion, in the appropriate clinical
 setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 
 Prominence of the right paratracheal region is consistent with the hilar
 adenopathy seen on previous CT scans.
