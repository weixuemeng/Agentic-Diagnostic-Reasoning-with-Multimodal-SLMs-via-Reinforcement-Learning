                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right basilar chest tube remains in place, though the side ports no longer
 lie in the posterior costophrenic angle.  The small right pleural effusion has
 decreased in size.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion.  The previously
 seen right lung base patchy opacification has resolved. Multiple scattered
 ill-defined nodular opacities are compatible with known metastatic disease,
 which has progressed compared with ___. There is no focal
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval resolution of right lung base patchy opacification, likely
 asymmetric edema.
 2. Decreased size of small right pleural effusion.
 3. Right basilar chest tube side ports no longer lie in the posterior
 costophrenic angle.
