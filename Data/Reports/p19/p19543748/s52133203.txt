                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right pleural effusion status post catheter
 placement.  PLEASE PERFORM AT 5:30PM ON ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:31 and 10:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar chest tube remains in unchanged position. Small right
 hydropneumothorax is unchanged. There is increased patchy opacification within
 the right lung base.  This could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema given its
 rapid development over the course of a few hours. Multiple scattered
 ill-defined nodular opacities are compatible with known metastatic disease.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Streaky left basilar
 atelectasis is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged appearance of small right hydropneumothorax.  Interval development
 of patchy opacification in the right lung base which given its rapid
 development may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but is nonspecific, and
 hemorrhage or infection can have a similar appearance. Continued followup is
 recommended.
