                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-erect portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The patient is rotated to the left.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely relate to atelectasis and low lung volumes but component
 of aspiration is not excluded.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles
 and trace pleural effusions may be present.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.
