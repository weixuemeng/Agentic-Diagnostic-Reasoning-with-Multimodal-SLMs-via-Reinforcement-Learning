                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia c/b loculated pleural effusion s/p
 chest tube placement  // eval for interval change     eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, and chest CT scans since
 ___, most recently ___ at 08:00 and ___, respectively.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Correlating the appearance of the frontal chest radiographs with concurrent
 chest CT scans, there has been a clear decrease in the volume of previous
 loculated right posterior pleural effusion, documented on the lateral view. 
 If there is any right pleural collection it is sub pulmonic.  Right basal
 atelectasis or scarring is mild.  Left lung is clear.  Mediastinum is midline.
 Right pleural drainage catheters are unchanged in their respective positions. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Monitoring with conventional chest radiographs rather than
 CT scans.  Any subpulmonic effusion can be assessed with ultrasound, avoiding
 ionizing radiation.
