                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain this morning, elevated troponin and
 abnormal EKG.  Recent pneumonia and myocardial infarction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear right
 basilar opacities are unchanged, potentially reflecting atelectasis and/ or
 scarring.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar, compatible
 with a small effusion.  Previously noted nodular opacity projecting over the
 right lung base is not well seen on the current exam.  Left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar linear opacities are unchanged, likely scarring and/ or
 atelectasis with unchanged small right pleural effusion.  No new focal
 consolidation.
