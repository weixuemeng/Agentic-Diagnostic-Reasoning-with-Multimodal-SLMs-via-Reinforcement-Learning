 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been extubated and a left basal chest drain has been removed. 
 Lung volumes are slightly low with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax seen.  A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the
 tip is in the mid svc.  Mild cardiomegaly may in part be due to the projection
 and in part due to low lung volumes.  Similarly widening of the mediastinum
 may in part be due to the projection.  No frank pulmonary edema seen. 
 Interval improvement in the streaky left mid lung opacities, presumed
 atelectasis.  Median sternotomy sutures are unchanged in appearance.  Coronary
 artery bypass clips seen.
