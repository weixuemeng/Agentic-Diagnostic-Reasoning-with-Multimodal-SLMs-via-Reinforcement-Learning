 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Worsening patchy and linear opacities at both lung
 bases, which have fluctuated in severity over serial chest radiographs.  Given
 this fluctuation, differential diagnosis includes recurrent atelectasis,
 aspiration, and less likely a dependent distribution of edema.  Calcified
 pleural plaques are noted, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure.
