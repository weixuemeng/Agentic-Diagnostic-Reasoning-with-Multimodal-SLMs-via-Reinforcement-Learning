                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ICD  // rule out pneumothorax and lead
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided ICD with the tip in the right ventricle.  Low lung volumes with
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Right lower lung zone opacity may
 reflect a combination of atelectasis, crowded vessels and posterior rib,
 rather than pneumonia.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiac enlargement. 
 No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.
 Right lower lung zone opacity is probably a combination of atelectasis,
 crowded vessels and posterior rib, rather than pneumonia.  If there are
 symptoms of infection, repeat chest radiographs including oblique views should
 be obtained.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If there are symptoms of infection, repeat chest
 radiographs including oblique views should be obtained.
