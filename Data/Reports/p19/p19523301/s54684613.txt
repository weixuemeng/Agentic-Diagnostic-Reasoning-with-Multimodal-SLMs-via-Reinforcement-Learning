                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CLL, previously known left pleural effusion and worsening
 hypotension, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is a moderate left effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation, slightly larger than on ___. 
 Prominence of the right hilum, particularly inferiorly is noted, essentially
 unchanged. The right lung is grossly clear, aside from some patchy opacity in
 the infrahilar region which has improved. The extreme right costophrenic angle
 is excluded from the film.  There is upper zone redistribution, likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
