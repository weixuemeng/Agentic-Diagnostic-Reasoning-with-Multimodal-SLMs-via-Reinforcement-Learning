                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CLL with respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Extremely low lung volumes with bibasilar opacification that could well
 reflect atelectasis.  However, in view of the clinical history, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Upper zones are clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
