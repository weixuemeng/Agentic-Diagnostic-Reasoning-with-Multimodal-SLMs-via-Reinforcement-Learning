                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CLL, confusion, shortness of breath, and increased oxygen
 requirement.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 medial basal parenchymal opacity has decreased in extent and severity.  The
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is present in unchanged manner, but the
 pre-existing pleural effusion has substantially decreased.  Also decreased are
 previously existing signs indicative of mild fluid overload.  Currently, the
 image presents no evidence of interval recurrence of new parenchymal
 opacities.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper range of
 normal.  The right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed, while the
 right PICC line is in unchanged position.
