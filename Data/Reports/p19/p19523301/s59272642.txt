                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CLL with new left lower lobe collapse, please assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ as
 well as CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable chest radiograph demonstrates minimally improved aeration
 of the previously completely collapsed left lower lobe.    Remainder of the
 left and right lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax is evident.  A small left
 pleural effusion is likely.  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the distal
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent though improved left lower lobe collapse with a small
 left pleural effusion.
