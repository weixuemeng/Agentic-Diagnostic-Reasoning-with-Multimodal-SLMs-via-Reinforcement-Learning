                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CLL with septic shock and bacteremia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again some
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure and layering pleural effusions, more prominent on the left. 
 Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 In the absence of a lateral view, it would be difficult to exclude pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Right central catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
