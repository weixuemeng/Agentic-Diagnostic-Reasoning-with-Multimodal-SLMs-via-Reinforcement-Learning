 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:21 PM
  No evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. Bibasal opacities, likely
  correspond to the bronchial wall thickening seen in the prior CT of ___.
  Subtle increase in the right basal opacities, may represent atelectasis. A PA
  and lateral chest radiograph can be obtained with better inspiratory effort
  for better assessment of the same. ___ d/w Dr.___ at 11:20 p.m on

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:27 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CLL and Aspergillus, as well as CMV
 adrenalitis, now with severe tachypnea and decreased heart sounds.  Is there
 evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are low, not improved since ___.  Left lower lobe findings
 are probably chronic atelectasis, but the new opacification at the right lung
 base could be pneumonia.  Upper lungs are hyperlucent, but since the patient
 does not have emphysema, this is explained by diminished perfusion.  In the
 setting of bibasilar atelectasis where one would expect redirection of blood
 flow to the aerated upper lungs, this can be explained by severe hypovolemia
 or massive pulmonary emboli.  There are no findings to suggest pericardial or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
