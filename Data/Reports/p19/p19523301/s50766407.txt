                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Considerations in a patient with CLL.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance, and the patient was
 extubated in the meantime interval.  Left pleural effusion appears to be at
 least moderate, unchanged, associated with opacity, most likely  corresponding
 to the consolidation seen on the CT torso from ___, potentially
 reflecting infectious process, with interval questionable increase since the
 prior examination and might explain patient's symptoms.
