                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for rotation, low lung volumes
 and AP portable technique, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear
 unchanged, including suspected mild cardiomegaly.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  There is patchy left basilar opacity suggestive of minor
 atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Although difficult to
 entirely exclude, there is no definite evidence for pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination without definite evidence for acute disease. 
 Noting the limitations of this study, if pulmonary symptoms were to persist or
 worsen, a short-term followup radiographs should be considered, preferably
 with standard PA and lateral technique, if possible to reassess the
 significance, if any, of vague left basilar opacity.
