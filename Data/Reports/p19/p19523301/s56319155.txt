 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 17:05 p.m. and allowing for technical differences,
 there is minimal interval change.  Again seen is a right IJ central line with
 tip over distal SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but
 unchanged.  A left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation is
 unchanged.  Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is also similar,
 allowing for differences in technique.  Suspect small layering right effusion.
