                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CLL and pneumonia, neutropenic fever,
 assess for worsening pneumonia, pleural effusions, new coin lesion in the left
 apex.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___, a prior study of ___ at
 ___ and ___ at 909.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall, when compared with the prior study dating back to ___, there
 has been interval improvement in aeration with residual patchy opacities at
 both bases likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  No focal consolidation is seen at the left apex.
 No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  Lucency
 underneath the left hemidiaphragm likely represents an air-filled stomach.
