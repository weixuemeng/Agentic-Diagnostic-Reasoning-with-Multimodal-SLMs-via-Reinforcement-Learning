                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing lower extremity edema; question fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The right lung remains clear.  There is again mild
 relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with patchy opacification most
 suggestive of atelectasis, although somewhat improved.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Prior healed fractures involve the right
 posterolateral sixth and seventh ribs.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Persistent volume loss and
 atelectasis in the left lower lung, but most recently somewhat improved.
