                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  CLL.  Pneumonia.  Question clearing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The previous peribronchial infiltration in both lower lungs has cleared. 
 Lungs are unremarkable except for band of atelectasis at one of the bases seen
 only on the lateral view and the persistently low though somewhat improved
 lung volumes due, on the left, to severe splenomegaly.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes are normal aside from heavy atherosclerotic calcification in
 the aortic knob.
