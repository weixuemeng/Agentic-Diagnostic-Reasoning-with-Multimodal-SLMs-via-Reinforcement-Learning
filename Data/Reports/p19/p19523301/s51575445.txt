 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and likely neutropenia and cough. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The right

 opacity.  There is also new extensive retrocardiac opacity in the left lower
 lobe and patchy left mid lung opacity likely within the lingula.  A pleural
 effusion is suspected on the left.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  There is calcification of the aortic knob.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia with a suspected
 small left-sided pleural effusion.
