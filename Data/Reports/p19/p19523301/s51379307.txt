 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 11:50 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  Cuff distends the
 tracheal caliber and its upper margin is sharply defined by pooled secretions.
 Clinical attention is recommended.  Nasogastric tube is looped distally and
 returns to the gastric fundus.  Bibasilar atelectasis, more severe on the left
 than right, is stable as is small left pleural effusion, borderline
 cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement.  New right jugular line can
 be traced as far as the mid SVC, but the tip is indistinct.  No pneumothorax.
