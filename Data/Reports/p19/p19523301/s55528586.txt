                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia, now febrile with crackles throughout
 lungs, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph obtained.  Evaluation limited
 due to patient rotation to the left.  There is left basal opacity which could
 represent effusion and possibly atelectasis/pneumonia.  The right lung appears
 clear.  A PICC line is seen in the right arm tip extending to the level of the
 low SVC.  Aortic atherosclerosis is noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with left basal opacity, increased from prior,
 concerning for effusion with probable consolidation which may represent
 worsening pneumonia.
