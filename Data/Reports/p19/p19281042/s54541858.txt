                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with left lower lobe crackles,
 question infection, additional history includes diabetes and hepatitis C virus
 cirrhosis, who has been feeling poorly of late.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___, ___, and CTA chest of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a micronodular
 pattern of parenchymal opacification with a lower lobe predominance.  There
 are low lung volumes which accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  The heart
 size remains normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 lymphadenopathy.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Micronodular pattern of parenchymal opacification predominantly
 in the lower lobes, similar in appearance compared with ___ of this year. 
 While this might represent recurrent atypical infection (viral), other
 considerations include a pneumoconiosis or sarcoidosis although findings were
 not present one year prior arguing against the latter two.  This is unlikely
 to represent metastasis given its stability over one month, though this
 remains a consideration.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:40 p.m. by phone.
