                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with HTN, HLD, afib on Coumadin, recently discharged s/p R
 inguinal hernia repair readmitted for colonic pseudoobstruction, found on flex
 sig to have ischemic bowel and CT findings concerning for carcinomatosis.  //
 post-op, intubated
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  This limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.5 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present.  This overlies a rounded focus of air
 which is thought to represent gas within a large hiatal hernia.  There is
 associated elevation of left hemidiaphragm and overlying left base
 atelectasis.  The left lung apex appears grossly clear.  Left mid zone is
 considerably obscured due to rotation, but the possibility of pleural fluid at
 the left base cannot be excluded.
 
 On the right, there is new opacity, particularly in the right mid and lower
 zones.  This in part represents vascular plethora, but the right hemidiaphragm
 is now obscured suggesting a pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New opacity at the right lung base, likely a pleural effusion, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Suspect new vascular plethora/early CHF, based on the appearance of the
 right upper and mid zones.
 3. Large left hiatal hernia, with left lung base atelectasis and pleural
 effusion.
 4. Limited assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Allowing for
 significant rotation, no definite change.
 5. No pneumothorax identified.
