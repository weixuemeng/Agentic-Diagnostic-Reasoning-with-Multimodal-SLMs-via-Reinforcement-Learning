                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TAC, end ileostomy and rectus mucus fistula
 with b/l crackles  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 9 03:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is not visualized on the current study and is apparently been
 removed.  Clinical correlation is requested.  An NG type tube extends to a
 site overlying the left lung base, presumably ___ within the stomach at the
 site of a  large left hiatal hernia.
 
 Again seen is extensive opacification of the left mid and lower zones.  On
 today's study, there is additional hazy opacity extending into the lower
 portion of the left upper zone.
 
 The right lung is similar in appearance, with hazy opacity at right lung base
 which could reflect pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Background interstitial opacities in the right upper and mid
 could represent either interstitial edema or other interstitial infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval removal of the ET tube --___ correlation is requested.
 Overall similar to the prior study, but with new hazy opacity in the left
 upper zone.
