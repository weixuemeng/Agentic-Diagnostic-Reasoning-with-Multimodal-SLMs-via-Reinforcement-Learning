  1.  Stable chest.
  2. No displaced rib fractures.
  
  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
  radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
  cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
  either bone detail views or CT scanning.

 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.
