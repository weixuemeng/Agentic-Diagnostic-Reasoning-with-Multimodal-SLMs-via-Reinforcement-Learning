                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal PNA, ?TB, acute hypoxia on 5L O2.
 Assess for interval change or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are again noted to be hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Persistent left lower lobe opacity with interval progression of
 right lower lobe opacity.  Again seen are calcifications along the left chest
 wall which are unchanged prior examination can consistent with calcified
 plaques.  Scarring within the left costophrenic angle is again noted. 
 Possible calcified plaques along the right lateral lung are similar to prior
 examination.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable.  The aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged left lower lobe opacity with progression of right lower lobe
 opacity consistent with evolving multifocal pneumonia.
 2.  Findings suggestive of emphysema or COPD.
 3.  Calcified pleural plaques.
 4.  No pulmonary edema.
