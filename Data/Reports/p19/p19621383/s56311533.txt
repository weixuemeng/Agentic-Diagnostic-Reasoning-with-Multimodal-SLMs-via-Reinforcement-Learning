  Calcifications along the left chest suggesting calcified pleural plaques. Left
  basilar opacity may be due to scarring.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD, bronchiectasis, who presents from his PCPs office
 with O2 saturations of 70% and upper respiratory tract infection.  Evaluate
 for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded.  There is a background of emphysema. There is a
 questionable opacity in the right lower lung, which would be better evaluated
 with chest CT.  Calcifications along the left chest laterally suggest
 calcified pleural plaques.  Scarring may account for obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle.  There may also be calcified pleural plaques projecting
 over the right lung laterally as well.  No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is
 normal.  The aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Questionable opacity in the right lower lung, which would be better evaluated
 with chest CT.
 Calcifications along the left chest suggesting calcified pleural plaques. 
 Left basilar opacity may be due to scarring.
