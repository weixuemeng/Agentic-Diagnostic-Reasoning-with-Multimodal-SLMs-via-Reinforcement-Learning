                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:57 a.m.
 
 A tracheostomy is in place. Tubing coursing vertically over the right chest is
 consistent with known VP shunt.
 
 There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.  This could
 represent an early infectious infiltrate. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 the differential could include changes secondary to aspiration.  No other
 infiltrate is identified.  No CHF or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity left base, question asymmetric atelectasis versus
 early infiltrate or focus of aspiration.
