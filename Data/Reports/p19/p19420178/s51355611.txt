                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ovarian carcinoma and shortness
 of breath.  Assess for pleural effusion, pneumonia or metastatic disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged, the configuration demonstrating a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour, but no other significant
 abnormalities are present.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of a small amount of
 right-sided pleural effusion blunting the right lateral pleural sinus and
 extending posteriorly as identified on the lateral view.  Some linear
 parenchymal densities on the right lung base are consistent with plate
 atelectases.  No conclusive evidence for pleural effusion in left hemithorax. 
 No other new parenchymal infiltrates are present.  No pneumothorax is seen in
 the apical area.  Position of previously described orthopedic hardware in
 upper lumbar spine, unchanged.  Moderate gas distention of large bowel is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of right-sided pleural effusion since the next
 preceding study of ___.  As this patient has a history of ovarian
 carcinoma, the possibility of metastatic process must be considered.
