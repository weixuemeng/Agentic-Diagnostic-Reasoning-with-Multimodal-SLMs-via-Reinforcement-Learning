                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and history of
 right-sided pleural effusion, on chemo.  Question pneumonia versus other acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided pleural effusion is once again seen, increased in
 size since the prior examination.  The remainder of the lungs remain clear of
 any focal opacities or consolidations.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged in size.  Linear parenchymal densities at the right lung base are
 consistent with plate atelectasis.  Position of the previously described
 orthopedic hardware is unchanged.
 
 Multiple air fluid levels are seen within the abdomen as well as dilation of
 small bowel. This is unchanged from the prior study, but clinical correlation
 is recommended as this may be due to persistent small bowel obstruction or
 substantial ileus.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Increased in size of right pleural effusion as compared to ___
 study.
 
 2. Multiple air fluid levels and dilat
 ion of the small bowel as described above raising concern for substantial
 ileus or bowel obstruction; clinical correlation is recommended.
