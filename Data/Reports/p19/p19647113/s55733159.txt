                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD/ pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 ventricle and region of the coronary sinus.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size
 is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged with calcification of
 the thoracic aorta noted.  Increased interstitial markings are seen, most
 pronounced along the periphery of the lungs and within the upper lobes
 suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease.  There may be mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  Degenerative changes are seen within the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  A high-resolution chest CT could be
 obtained for further assessment on a non-emergent basis, if not done
 previously.
