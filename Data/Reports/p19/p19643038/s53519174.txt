 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post kidney transplant, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has mildly increased.  In addition, there is evidence of
 baso-apical blood flow redistribution, suggestive of mild overall fluid
 overload.  No pleural effusion is seen on the frontal or the lateral
 radiograph.  No pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
