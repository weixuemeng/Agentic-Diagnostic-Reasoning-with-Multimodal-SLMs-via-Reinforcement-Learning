 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a large layering left effusion.  Bilateral mild to moderate perihilar
 and pulmonary edema has slightly worsened.  The heart remains stably enlarged
 which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Right internal jugular
 Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with its tip projecting in the proximal
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax may be diminished as the patient was not imaged in the upright
 position.
