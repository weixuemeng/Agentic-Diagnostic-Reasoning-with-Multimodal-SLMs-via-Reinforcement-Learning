                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with persistent cough  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation is made to CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral view, there is increased opacity projecting over the lower
 thoracic spine.  On remote prior CT scan there is no significant degenerative
 changes to account for this density.  While this could be due to interval
 development of degenerative changes, underlying parenchymal opacity in the
 lungs, in one of the lower lobes is possible though not confirmed on the
 frontal view.  Increased opacity at the left cardiophrenic angle is compatible
 with fat pad seen on prior CT.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity projecting over the spine on lateral view only.  Given lack of
 significant degenerative changes on prior CT, this may represent a focal
 parenchymal opacity in the setting of pneumonia in the proper clinical
 setting.  Followup after treatment suggested to document resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___.
