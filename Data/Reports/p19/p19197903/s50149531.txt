                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
 cough, and fever.  Evaluate for possible new pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size is difficult to assess because
 of overlying left-sided pulmonary abnormalities.  Heart size is probably
 normal as there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multiple
 previous chest examinations are reviewed in sequence, demonstrating that the
 fibrotic changes have progressed continuously since ___.  Comparison with the
 next preceding chest examination of ___ demonstrates further
 progress to a lesser degree.  Again, there are bilateral, mostly basal linear
 changes, most marked on the left side where there also blend with the
 mediastinal structures and obscure the cardiac contours.  On the left base
 laterally, in the vicinity of the chest wall, there are increased local
 densities identified, which are suggestive of possibly new acute processes. 
 The diagnosis is not conclusive in light of the previously existing rather
 advanced changes.  It is therefore suggested to treat the patient for the
 present acute infection and take a followup chest examination with shorter
 time interval (one week) to see if these changes are regressing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild regression of chronic fibrotic changes since ___. 
 Suspicion for local left lower lobe lateral infiltrate.  Recommend followup.
