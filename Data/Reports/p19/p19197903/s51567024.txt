                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of known interstitial
 pulmonary fibrosis with possible left lower lobe opacity on outside
 radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new patchy opacity in the left lower lobe which partly
 obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  Otherwise, extensive fibrosis appears
 unchanged.  Evidence of prior wedge resection is again noted at the level of
 the lingula.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette appears stable.
 Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1)  New left lower lobe opacity suggestive of left lower lobe pneumonia.
 Followup CXR recommended in 4 weeks after therapy to ensure resolution.
 
 2)  Similar appearance of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
