                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PE with ongoing hypoxia  // interval changes
 in pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 CT torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, lung volumes have improved,
 as well as left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.  No appreciable
 effusion on the right.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no
 central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation.
 No pneumothorax.  Significant dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta is
 consistent with known thoracic aortic aneurysm, better assessed on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Significantly improved left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 3. Stable appearance of dilated descending thoracic aorta, consistent with
 known thoracic aortic aneurysm, better characterized on prior CT.
