                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is a large hiatal
 hernia and the intrathoracic stomach may contain a large bezoar.  A dual
 chamber cardiac pacer is seen.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There are
 median sternotomy wires and clips, presumably from a prior CABG procedure. 
 The aortic valve is calcified which suggests aortic stenosis. The lungs are
 clear without focal opacities, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is no free air beneath the hemidiaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Very large hiatal hernia may contain a large bezoar.  No
 pneumonia, edema or pleural effusion.
