                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is patchy left base opacity worrisome for left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 The right lung is likely clear.  A small focal opacity in the right medial
 lung base on the AP view, most likely represents vascular structure though
 additional site of consolidation is not excluded.  Trace left pleural effusion
 is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Possible additional small focus of infection in
 the right lung versus vascular structure.
