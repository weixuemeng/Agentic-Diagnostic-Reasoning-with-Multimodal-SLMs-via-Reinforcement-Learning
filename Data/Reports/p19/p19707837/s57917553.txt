                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain. hb 5.5.  // R/O CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hazy increased opacity projecting over the lung apices, left greater
 than right. This is not definitely parenchymal in nature and may be technical
 and due to overlying soft tissues. Elsewhere the lungs are clear, there is no
 effusion.  There is an ill-defined contour of the aortic knob.  There are
 diffuse lucencies throughout the bones particularly notable in the region of
 the left scapula and right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Ill-defined contour of the aortic knob. In setting of chest pain, CT should
 be considered to further assess.  Alternatively if low suspicion for acute
 aortic syndrome, repeat with PA and lateral views can be performed.
 2.  Increased opacity projecting over the upper lungs, left greater than right
 likely technical due to overlying soft tissues but can be further clarified by
 a PA and lateral.
 3.  Osseous findings compatible with patient's known multiple myeloma.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ the
 phone ___ min after time of discovery at 16:00 on ___ .
