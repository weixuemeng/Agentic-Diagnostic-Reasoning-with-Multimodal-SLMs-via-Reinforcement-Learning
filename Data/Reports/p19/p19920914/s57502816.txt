                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Presumed lung cancer status post mediastinoscopy, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Equivocal tiny left apical pneumothorax is seen.  There is
 persistent left upper lobe collapse.  Further opacification of the left lung
 may reflect an increase in atelectasis given the associated volume loss, with
 a pleural effusion.  A more rounded area of lucency within the left upper lung
 is new on this study.  The right lung is essentially clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged and the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Equivocal tiny left apical pneumothorax versus artifact from the
 Luftsichel sign.  Continued surveillance is recommended.  
 2.  Lucency within the left mid lung may represent a necrotic, air-filled
 mass.  The findings could be further evaluated with a lateral view.
 3.  Increased opacification of the left lung may reflect further collapse in
 the left lung and/or a pleural effusion.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 15: on ___ by telephone at the time of discovery.
