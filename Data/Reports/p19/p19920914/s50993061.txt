 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ NSCLC s/p L pneumonectomy and SVC, COPD, now SOB with
 increased RR  // evaluate for lung collapse (decreased aeration Left lower

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, again there is virtually complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax with shift of the mediastinal contour is
 to that side, consistent with the history of left pneumonectomy. An small
 pleural effusion with right basilar atelectatic changes is seen, though the
 right lung is otherwise clear.  Vascular shunt is again noted in the
 brachiocephalic vein extending to the SVC and right atrium.
