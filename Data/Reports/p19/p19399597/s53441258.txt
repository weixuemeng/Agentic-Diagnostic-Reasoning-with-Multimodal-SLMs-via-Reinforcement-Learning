                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, evaluate for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Minimal opacity at right lung base is
 probably atelectasis and less likely an early focus of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal right basilar opacity, favoring atelectasis over focal pneumonia.
