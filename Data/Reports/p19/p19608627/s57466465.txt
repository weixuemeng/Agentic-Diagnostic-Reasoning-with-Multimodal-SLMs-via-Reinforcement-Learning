                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pleural effusion status post pigtail catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Compared
 to two prior radiographs from today, there has been continued decrease in size
 of left pleural effusion, now small in volume.  There is persistent left basal
 consolidation which is likely atelectatic in nature.  A small right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
