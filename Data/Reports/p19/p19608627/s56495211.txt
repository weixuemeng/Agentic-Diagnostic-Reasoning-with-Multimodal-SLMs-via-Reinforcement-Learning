                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with CLL and large left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Evaluation for residual effusions after chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A left pleural
 catheter is seen coiled in similar position compared to the prior study.  The
 previously seen left pleural effusion with accompanying left basilar
 opacification likely representing atelectasis is essentially unchanged since
 the prior study.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  A small right pleural
 effusion is also unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise, unchanged since the
 prior study.
