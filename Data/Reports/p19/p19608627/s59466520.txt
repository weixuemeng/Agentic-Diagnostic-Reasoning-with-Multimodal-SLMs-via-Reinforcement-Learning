 FINDINGS:  Right lower lobe consolidation has progressed compared to the prior
 study and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia in the setting of febrile
 neutropenia.  It is associated with mild volume loss. Additional nonspecific
 opacity has developed in the left retrocardiac region and could be due to
 either atelectasis or an additional site of infection.  Several linear areas
 of atelectasis are also present in the left lower lobe and lingular regions. 
 Small right pleural effusion appears slightly decreased compared to the prior
 study.  No definite left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Fullness of right hilar region is concerning for
 lymph node enlargement, and note is made of both mediastinal and hilar nodal
 abnormalities reported on prior PET-CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Evolving right lower lobe pneumonia with a component of mild volume loss. 
 Followup radiograph is suggested to document resolution following appropriate
