                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and multiple prior studies dating back to at
 least ___.
 
 As compared to the most recent prior study, the heart size and mediastinum are
 stable in appearance.  There is left pleural effusion still present, at least
 partially loculated, mild to moderate.  Left chest tube has been discontinued.
 The apical component of the pleura is thickened by the effusion with
 potentially minimal amount of apical air still seen.  There is increase in the
 interstitial opacities bilaterally, left more than right that might be
 consistent with an interstitial engorgement.  Right pleural effusion is
 minimal.  Partially imaged catheter in the right upper quadrant is seen.
