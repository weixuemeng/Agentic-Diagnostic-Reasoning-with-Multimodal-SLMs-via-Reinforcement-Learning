                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The right-sided pleural effusion has lessened when compared to the prior
 radiograph.  Background probable mild pulmonary hyperinflation.  Increased
 bronchovascular markings in the right lower lung in particular are noted. 
 Degenerative changes in the spine.  No evidence of fluid overload.  Visualized
 osseous structures appear grossly within normal limits.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Lessened right-sided pleural effusion.  Background bronchial wall thickening
 particularly in the right lower lung zone on today's examination, more
 pronounced than on prior examination.  The patient's CT examination from today
 would suggest the patient has had an interval pleurodesis, but the
 calcification identified then is difficult to appreciate.
