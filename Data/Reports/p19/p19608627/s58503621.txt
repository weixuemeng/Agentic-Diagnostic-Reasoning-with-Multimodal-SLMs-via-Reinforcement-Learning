                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever and neutropenia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes.  Small
 right pleural effusion persists and cardiac silhouette is larger.  There is no
 left pleural effusion.  Right infrahilar peribronchial opacification is either
 early edema or mild pneumonia.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.   Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged since ___ exam.
 2.  New mild cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
 3.  Right basal edema, or early pneumonia.  Distinguishing between the two,
 and evaluating possible pericardial effusion could be achieved by Chest CT
 performed with the patient prone.
 
 I discussed these findings by telephone with housestaff [details addended].
