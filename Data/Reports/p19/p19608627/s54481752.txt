                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with prior right pleurodesis, now status post
 left pleurodesis for left-sided malignant effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a previously seen
 small left pleural effusion with two pleural tubes in unchanged position
 compared to the prior study.  The right lung opacification is also again seen,
 and likely represents a combination of atelectasis with a small effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax or significant pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 unchanged since the prior study.  Apical pleural thickening is also noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Small left pleural effusion is again seen, any significant change
 is not identified since the prior study.
