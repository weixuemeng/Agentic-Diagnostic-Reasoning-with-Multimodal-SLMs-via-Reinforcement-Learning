 interval resolution of rightward mediastinal shift.  Small right pleural
 effusion persists.  Subtle opacity of the right lower lung field persists. 
 Aortic knob calcification is again noted.  Evaluation of heart size is limited
 in the setting of overlying pleural effusion.  There is decreased downward
 displacement of the gastric bubble.

 of left pleural effusion, which is now moderate to large, with resolved
