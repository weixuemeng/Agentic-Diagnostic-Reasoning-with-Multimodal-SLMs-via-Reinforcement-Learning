                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal
 contour appears unchanged.  Bilateral hilar enlargement with perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema,
 slightly worse in the interval.  A large right pleural effusion is
 substantially increased in the interval.   A small left pleural effusion is
 also likely present.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.  Substantial increase in size of
 large right pleural effusion with bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion is
 without substantial interval change.
