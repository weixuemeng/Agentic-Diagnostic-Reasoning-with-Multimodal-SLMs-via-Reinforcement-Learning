                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lethargy for 3 weeks, infectious work-up.  //
 Eval PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Underpenetration of the lung bases due to patient
 body habitus makes assessment slightly suboptimal.  Prominence and
 indistinctness of the hila and perihilar opacity suggest pulmonary edema. 
 Linear left mid lung atelectasis/scarring is seen.  Small right and possibly
 small left pleural effusions are seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and small pleural effusions
 suggest CHF, underlying infection/pneumonia difficult to exclude.
