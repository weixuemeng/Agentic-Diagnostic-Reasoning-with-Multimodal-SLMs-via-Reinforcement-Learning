                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from yesterday's radiograph
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of the endotracheal tube is 4.4 cm above the carina and is
 appropriately positioned.  An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into
 the stomach; however, its distal end is off the radiographic review.  Tip of
 right internal jugular line lies at mid SVC.  Over the last 24 hours right
 upper lobe consolidation has improved, whereas right lower lung and left
 apical consolidation is overall unchanged.  Increased retrocardiac density
 reflecting left lower lung atelectasis and/or consolidation is similar.  Small
 right-sided pleural effusion is stable.  Heart size is top normal and
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
