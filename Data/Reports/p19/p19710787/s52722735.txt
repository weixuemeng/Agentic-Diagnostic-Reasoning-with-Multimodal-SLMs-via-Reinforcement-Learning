                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube and NG tube placement, please evaluate
 positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The mid to lower lateral left hemithorax is not fully included on
 the image.  Single supine portable view of the chest demonstrates nasogastric
 tube passing into the stomach and out of view.  Endotracheal tube noted at the
 level of the clavicles, 9.9 cm above the carina.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Depression of the right hilum noted in
 conjunction with the right lower lung opacification is concerning for right
 lower lobe collapse.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle is likely
 due to small pleural effusion.  Faint asymmetry in opacification at the
 bilateral lung apices may reflect patient positioning or possibly layering
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube at the level of the clavicles, 9.9 cm above the
 carina, could be advanced ~ 3-5 cm.  Well-positioned nasogastric tube.  Right
 lower lung opacification may represent collapse.  Small right pleural
 effusion.  Asymmetry in opacification of bilateral upper lobes, right greater
 than left, may reflect patient positioning or possibly layering effusion.  See
 immediately subsequent CT.
