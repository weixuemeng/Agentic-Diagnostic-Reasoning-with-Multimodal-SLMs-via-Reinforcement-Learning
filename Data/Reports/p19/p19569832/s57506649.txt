                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of subdural hematoma status post evacuation.  Evaluate
 placement of NG tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube is seen within the stomach.  A left subclavian central
 venous catheter ends in the upper SVC.  There has been removal of the
 endotracheal tube.  In comparison to the prior radiograph, there are lower
 lung volumes with new mild hazy bibasilar opacities consistent with
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly larger, likely
 due to the lower lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 An IVC filter is seen within the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube ends in the stomach.
 2.  Mild bibasilar hazy opacities consistent with atelectasis.
