 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large amount of free intraperitoneal air is present below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Within the chest, small calcified granulomas are present in

 opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although aspiration is an additional
 consideration given patient's risk for this entity.  Several sclerotic left
 rib lesions are noted and may be related to metastatic prostate cancer as
 reported on recent CT torso.

 Dr. ___ at 9:41 a.m. on ___.
 2.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis versus aspiration.
