                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage status post
 intubation.  Question tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube extending
 approximately 5 mm into the proximal right main bronchus.  The enteric tube
 extends into the region of the stomach with side port below the GE junction. 
 An IVC filter is in expected location.  Mildly prominent cardiac silhouette is
 accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique.  Mild mediastinal prominence
 is likely due to supine technique, although in the setting of trauma, vascular
 injury should be correlated with cross-sectional imaging.  Mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.  Interstitial
 markings are prominent, likely due to crowding related to low lung volumes. 
 Trace effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 There is mild irregularity along the anterolateral aspect of the left eighth
 and ninth ribs, to be correlated with focal tenderness.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube 5 mm distal to the right main bronchus.  Recommend retraction by
 approximately 4-5 cm to achieve appropriate positioning.
 
 2.  Enteric tube in appropriate position.
 
 3.  Subtle irregularity along anterolateral left eighth and ninth ribs, to be
 correlated with focal tenderness for possible fracture.
 
 4.  Low lung volumes, accentuating bronchovascular markings.
 
 Finding of right mainstem bronchus intubation phoned to the SICU at 6:30 pm by
 Dr. ___.
