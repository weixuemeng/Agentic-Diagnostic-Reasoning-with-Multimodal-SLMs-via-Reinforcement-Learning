                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, rule out infiltrate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and an unfolded aorta.
 Engorgement of the vasculature is consistent with fluid overload.  Left lower
 lobe opacities are consistent with a prominent fat pad as well as atelectasis.
 No focal consolidations are present that are concerning for pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion.  On the lateral view, projecting over the spine and under
 the left diaphragam, is a 2.5 cm  oblong density which has no clear correlate
 on the frontal views.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Cardiomegaly and engorgement of the vasculature consistent with fluid
 overload. 
 2) 2.5 cm density projecting over the spine. Recommend repeat PA and lateral
 views after diuresis to reevaluate.
