                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachycardia, on chemo, pls eval for pna  // History: ___F
 with tachycardia, on chemo, pls eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ twelfth chest x-ray and ___ chest
 CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Postoperative changes of right upper lobectomy are again seen. Right chest
 wall port catheter tip at the RA SVC junction. There is more conspicuous
 opacity at the lateral aspect of the left lung overlying the posterior left
 eighth rib which corresponds to the nodular opacity on prior chest CT. Known
 other bilateral pulmonary nodules are not clearly depicted on this chest
 x-ray. There is no consolidation, effusion, or vascular congestion. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process PA.  Opacity in left lung laterally
 corresponds to region of known pulmonary nodule on prior chest CT. Other known
 bilateral pulmonary nodules are not as clearly seen on this chest x-ray
 although CT would offer additional details desired.
