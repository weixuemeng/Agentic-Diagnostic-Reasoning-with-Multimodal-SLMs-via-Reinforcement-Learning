                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with abnormal chest sound.  Rule out mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior exam for comparison.  Reports from ___ exam are axilla.
 
 FINDINGS:  Prior sternotomy was done for CABG.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are normal.  A small linear density is seen only on the lateral view
 in the retrosternal region.  This was already described in the ___ report and
 probably compatible with an atelectatic band.  Minimal left lower lobe
 atelectasis is seen.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Degenerative change of the left shoulder and the spine
 is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  There is no acute cardiopulmonary finding.
