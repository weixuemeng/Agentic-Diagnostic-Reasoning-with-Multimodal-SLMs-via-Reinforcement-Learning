 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known CHF with severe aortic stenosis presenting with
 increasing dyspnea for four days, assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The heart appears
 mildly enlarged.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than
 right.  Probable compressive lower lobe atelectasis is also present, left
 greater than right.  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema is also suspected. 
 Mediastinal contour is stable.  Surgical anchors are noted in the right
 humeral head.  Otherwise, the bony structures appear unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions,
 small-to-moderate and slightly larger on the left with associated lower lobe
 compressive atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly also noted with equivocal mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.
