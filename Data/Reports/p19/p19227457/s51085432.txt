                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer on gemcitabine.  Evaluate for infiltrate or
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate mild asymmetry at the
 right lung base compared to the left.  This may represent overlying breast
 shadow although in the right clinical situation, pneumonia cannot be ruled
 out.  There is no evidence of vascular congestion or interstitial edema.  No
 pleural effusions are identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart,
 mediastinum, and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild opacification at the right base which may, in the right clinical
 situation, represent pneumonia.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.
