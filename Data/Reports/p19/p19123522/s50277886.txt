                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall from standing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Linear opacities in the right mid lung
 laterally suggestive of scarring.  Low lung volumes likely account for
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
