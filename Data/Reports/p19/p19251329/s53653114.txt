                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Streaky
 right mid and lateral left lower lung opacities appear unchanged and suggest
 background scarring.  The lateral view also depicts similar retrocardiac
 opacity probably in the left lower lobe, which is also streaky in
 configuration and more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  These
 findings are similar to the prior study.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite change in left basilar opacities, streaky in
 morphology and suggestive of atelectasis based on longer chronicity.
