                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with EtOH cirrhosis presenting s/p fall, concern
 for possible infection as source of fall/ worsening jaundice. Please evaluate
 for pleural effusion, PNA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, lung volumes have decreased, accentuating the cardiac
 contour and pulmonary vasculature.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality may
 represent edema or underlying interstitial lung disease.  Chronic, healed
 right rib fractures are again seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with diffuse interstitial abnormality, reflecting edema
 versus underlying interstitial lung disease.  No evidence of pneumonia.
