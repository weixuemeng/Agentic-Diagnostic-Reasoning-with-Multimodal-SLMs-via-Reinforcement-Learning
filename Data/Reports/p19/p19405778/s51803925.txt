                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-pack-year history of smoking, presents with weakness,
 weight loss, decreased appetite, assess for pneumonia or mass lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate slight
 coarsening of reticular interstitial markings predominantly in the right upper
 lobe which could represent fibrosis in patient with strong smoking history. 
 There is relative opacity projecting over the right mid lung at the level of
 two posterior rib deformities which are unchanged.  There is no definite sign
 of pneumonia or mass lesion.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite sign of pneumonia or mass lesion.  Areas of scarring
 in the right upper lung, likely represent fibrosis.  Given the patient's
 extensive smoking history and symptomatology, a non-emergent CT of the chest
 may be performed to further assess as clinically warranted.
