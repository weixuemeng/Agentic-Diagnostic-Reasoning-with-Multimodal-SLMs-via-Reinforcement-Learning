                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with microscopic hematuria, crackles,
 and wheezing on examination, history of ___-pack-year smoking.  ? signs of
 vasculitis processes given renal disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  The heart size is unchanged and within normal
 limits.  There is mild elongation of the thoracic aorta but no evidence of
 local contour abnormalities or advanced wall calcifications.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  The pulmonary vascular pattern, however,
 indicates a prominence of the central vessel bilaterally, which appears in
 contrast to the more spares and irregular vascular distribution in the
 pulmonary periphery.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion on either side
 or in the posterior pleural sinuses identified on the lateral view.  Acute
 parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified on either side.  In the right
 hemithorax, as shown on previous examinations, there exist multiple old rib
 fractures, but no evidence of acute skeletal injuries can be identified.  In
 comparison with the previous study, the patient on today's examination was
 able to take a deeper breath, but otherwise, the findings are completely
 stable.
