                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of pneumonia from OSH, now with
 increased WOB.  // Please r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior study the lung volumes are much lower and new
 bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis; superimposed consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Small pleural effusions are possible.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis, left more than right. Superimposed
 consolidation would be difficult to exclude.
