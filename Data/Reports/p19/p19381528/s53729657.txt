 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest. Overlying EKG leads are present. 
 Previously noted right IJ central venous catheter is been removed as well as

 Subtle opacity at the right lateral lung base may also represent a site of
 pneumonia.  No overt signs of edema.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect effusion and possible pneumonia.
 2. Subtle opacity in the right lateral lung base may also represent pneumonia.
