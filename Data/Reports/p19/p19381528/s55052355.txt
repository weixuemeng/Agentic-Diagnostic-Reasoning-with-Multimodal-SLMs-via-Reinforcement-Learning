                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:13 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure
 and cough.  Severely anemic.  Evaluate for possible pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___.
 
 The patient is not in pulmonary edema, and very mild upper lobe pulmonary
 vascular engorgement is probably chronic.  Severe enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is longstanding, accompanied by azygos distention, suggest a strong
 component of right heart failure.  Chest CT on ___ showed
 mediastinal fat, not pericardial effusion responsible for some of the apparent
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and there is no reason to assume that
 has changed.
