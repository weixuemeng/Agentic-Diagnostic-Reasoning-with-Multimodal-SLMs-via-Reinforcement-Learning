                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral crackles and tachycardia.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 There are diffusely increased interstitial markings seen in the lungs
 bilaterally.  More significant opacity seen in the retrocardiac region on the
 lateral view.  Posterior costophrenic angles are not well seen, potentially
 due to effusions. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but essentially unchanged
 from prior.  Distended loop of bowel seen between the liver and the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Soft tissue are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Findings suggestive of congestive failure.
 Distended loop of bowel below the right hemidiapharm for which cllinical
 correlation is suggested and perhaps additional abdominal imaging.
