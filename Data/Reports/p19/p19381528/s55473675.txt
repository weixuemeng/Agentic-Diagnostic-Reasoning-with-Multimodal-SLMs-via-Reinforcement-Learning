                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with urosepsis s/p intubation for airway
 protection now with increased secretions  // Please assess for interval change
 given c/f developing PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:03
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 7.7 cm above the carina, at the lower edge of
 the medial clavicular heads.  NG tube tip overlies the left upper quadrant.  A
 sideport, if present, does not extend beyond the GE junction.  Right IJ
 central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technical
 differences.  Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, slightly denser.  A small left effusion
 would be difficult to exclude.  Minimal patchy at the right low minimal
 minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base is also again seen, similar
 prior.  No pneumothorax detected.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly more pronounced.  The
 differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region again noted, similar to prior.  This
 could represent focally prominent atelectasis, though an early pneumonic
 infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Doubt overt CHF.
