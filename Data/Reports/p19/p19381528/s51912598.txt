                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ex lap, assess position of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed same day 8 hours
 earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip at the level of
 the clavicles.  The nasogastric tube has also been placed with tip at the GE
 junction, should be advanced several centimeters into the stomach.  Unchanged
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac silhouette.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacifications likely represents left lower lobe collapse and possibly a small
 left pleural effusion.  Though cannot exclude developing infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Endotracheal tube well positioned.  Nasogastric tube should be advanced
 several centimeters to terminate into stomach.  
 2. Increased retrocardiac opacity likely representing left lower lobe
 collapse.
