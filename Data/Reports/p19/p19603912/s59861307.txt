                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with BiV pacemaker.  // Rule out pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities at
 the lung bases, right more than left, have decreased in extent and severity
 and are now less severe. However, they are still clearly visualized.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists. Status post CABG and sternotomy, the wires are in
 correct position. Left pectoral pacemaker.  No new focal parenchymal
 opacities. No larger pleural effusions. A 5 mm rounded calcified structure
 projects over the ventral aspect of the second right rib and is likely
 reflecting a sclerotic bone
