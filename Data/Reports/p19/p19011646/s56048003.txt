                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:35 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax after central line placement.  Evaluate
 pneumothorax after a second attempt at chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 11:59 p.m.:
 
 Right pigtail pleural drainage catheter projects over the right lower lateral
 hemithorax.  Right pneumothorax has been almost entirely evacuated,
 mediastinum has returned to ___ and the right hemidiaphragm to its
 physiologic position.  Lung volumes are quite low now, exaggerating what is
 probably mild pulmonary edema.  ET tube, left internal jugular line and upper
 enteric drainage tube are in standard placements, and on this supine
 radiograph, there is no indication of pneumoperitoneum, though small amounts
 of subdiaphragmatic gas would not be evident on the supine view.
