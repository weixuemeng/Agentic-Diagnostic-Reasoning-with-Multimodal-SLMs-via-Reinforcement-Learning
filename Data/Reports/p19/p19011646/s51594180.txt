 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, chest tube placement.  Evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has
 been removed.  There is no evidence for a right pneumothorax.  The partial
 atelectasis of the right lower lobe, leading to an increase in radiodensity of
 the right hilus, is not substantially changed.  Retrocardiac atelectasis of
 constant extent.
