                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:48 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check for reaccumulation of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 7:52 a.m.
 
 Only a small residual right pneumothorax is present, medially, and there is no
 appreciable right pleural effusion.  Right pleural tube is unchanged in
 position, right upper lung, with a large loop presumably external.  I
 discussed with the house officer the need to confirm that this loop is
 entirely external.
 
 A midline collection of air, roughly centered at the carina, could be a
 swallow of air in the esophagus, traversed by an upper enteric drainage tube
 which would need to be advanced 3 or 4 cm to move all the side ports into the
 stomach.  Atelectasis persists in the superior segment of the right lower
 lobe.  Atelectasis in the left lung, probably the lingula, is new.  Heart size
 is top normal.  There is no pulmonary edema or left pleural effusion.  ET tube
 is in standard placement and the left internal jugular line ends in the low
 SVC.
