                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heroin overdose, asthma, persistent hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild perihilar haziness with upper zone vascular
 redistribution and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary
 edema.  More focal ill-defined opacities within the lung bases could reflect
 aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  More focal ill-defined opacities in the lung bases are
 concerning for aspiration.
