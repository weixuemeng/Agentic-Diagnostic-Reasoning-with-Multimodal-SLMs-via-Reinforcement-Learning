                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation for alcohol withdrawal and
 agitation  // ___ year old woman s/p intubation for alcohol withdrawal and
 agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is 2.5 cm above the Carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
 Right-sided PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  There is dense
 retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/ effusion. There
 is increased hazy vasculature on the left. There is a more focal area of
 consolidation in the left mid lung.  Old rib fractures are again noted on the
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsened appearance of the left lung. It is unclear how much of this is due to
 fluid overload or if there is an underlying infectious infiltrate.
