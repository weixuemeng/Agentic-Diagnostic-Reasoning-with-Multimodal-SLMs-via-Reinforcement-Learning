                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman presenting with EtOH intoxication and s/p fall
 onto her chest (has chest wall pain).  // ?rib fracture or trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits. A moderately displaced fracture is noted to the mid shaft of the left
 clavicle, age indeterminate.  Similarly, multiple contiguous posterior
 left-sided rib fractures are chronic appearing, but age indeterminate given
 the lack of comparison study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Displaced fracture of the mid left clavicle and multiple contiguous posterior
 left rib fractures.  If these or other areas have clinical findings suggesting
 acute fracture, they should be marked and evaluated with bone detail views.
