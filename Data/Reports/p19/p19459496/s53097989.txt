                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new enteric tube has been place with tip relying the distal
 stomach.  ET tube is seen in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly.  Opacification at the right lung
 base may perhaps be slightly improved compared to the prior study, indicating
 perhaps lessened volume loss and decreased pleural effusion at the left base.
 There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of NG tube with tip in the stomach.
 Improvement in left retrocardiac opacity.
