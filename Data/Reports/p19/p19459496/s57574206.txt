                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation and new
 left MCA stroke, intubated on ___.  Evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube ends
 below the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of view.
 
 Compared with prior exam, the right lung shows diffuse, mostly basal alveolar
 opacities, hilar engorgement and upper vascular redistribution suggestive of
 cardiac decompensation. A small right sided effusion is worsened from prior. 
 
 In the left, there is nearly total opacification of the lung base with
 obscuration of the heart border and hemidiaphragm. The degree of opacification
 of the left lung base is conspicuously worse compared to the right lung base,
 suggesting underlying severe atelectasis in combination with the pulmonary
 edema and worsened left sided effusions.
 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present.  Cardiomegaly
 cannot be clearly assessed due to obscuration of the left heart border.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Acute pulmonary edema with associated worsening of pleural effusions.
 2.  Opacification of the left lung base suggests severe atelectasis underlying
 the pulmonary edema, likely due to bronchial occlusion by secretions.
