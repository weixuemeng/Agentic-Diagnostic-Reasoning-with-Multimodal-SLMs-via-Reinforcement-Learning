                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, congestion, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of
 COPD.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains aneurysmally dilated and
 tortuous, unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Ill-defined
 patchy opacity within the right lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia, and is
 new compared to the prior exam.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.   Posttraumatic changes of the right
 acromioclavicular joint are re- demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs after treatment are
 recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
