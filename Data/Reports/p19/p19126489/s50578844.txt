                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs of___, and prior chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new left-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
 Slightly increased opacification at the left lung base is likely due to
 atelectasis, but could represent early pneumonia. Conventional PA and Lateral
 chest radiographs are recommended if there are any clinical findings to
 suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  New left PICC ends in the mid SVC.
 2. PA and Lateral chest radiographs can better assess possible, new left lower
 lobe pneumonia.
