                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A band-like opacity in the left base
 likely represents segmental atelectasis.  No other focal opacities are
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Band-like opacity in the left lower lobe may represent
 atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical
 setting.
