                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with COPD and a cough.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 Emphysema is reflected in a very severe hyperinflation.  There are no findings
 of pulmonary consolidation.  There is greater accentuation of the interstitial
 abnormality and bronchial wall thickening in the left perihilar lung, probably
 extending into the anterior segment.  It would be necessary to inspect prior
 chest radiographs to see if this represents an acute change.  If so, it is
 more suggestive of a flare of bronchitis than pneumonia.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not distended enough to suggest elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure and there is no edema or pleural effusion.  Lateral view shows some
 dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, but the hilar pulmonary arteries are
 normal size.  It also shows a large calcification projecting over the cardiac
 silhouette which is difficult to localize, and therefore cannot be ascribed to
 mitral annulus calcification.  Heart size is normal.
 
 A bulge in the right diaphragmatic contour laterally is presumably an
 abdominal organ protruding through a diaphragmatic eventration or hernia, from
 the right upper abdominal quadrant.
