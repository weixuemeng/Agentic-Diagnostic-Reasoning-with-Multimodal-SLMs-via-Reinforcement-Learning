                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease and underlying pulmonary emphysema.  There is
 persistent eventration of the right hemidiaphragm or posterior diaphragmatic
 hernia, unchanged since priors.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary emphysema without acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
