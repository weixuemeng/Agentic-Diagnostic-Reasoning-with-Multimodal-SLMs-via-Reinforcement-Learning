                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD exacerbation, evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and chest CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflation, flattening of the diaphragms, and reticular interstitial
 opacities are unchanged from prior studies and consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Ill-defined opacities at bilateral lung bases
 could represent infection, aspiration, or pulmonary edema in the proper
 clinical setting.  Differentiation of these entities is difficult due to
 underlying extensive pulmonary parenchymal disease.  Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Pleural effusions are small if present at all. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacities at bilateral lung bases may represent infection, aspiration, or
 pulmonary edema in the proper clinical setting.
 2. Severe underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
