                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, status post fall, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly improved from the most
 recent prior study.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Dense calcification
 of the aortic knob is re-demonstrated.  Deformity at the right lateral fourth
 rib is compatible with healed prior fracture.  No acute displaced rib
 fractures are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  No acute displaced rib fractures but an old healed right lateral fourth
 rib fracture.
