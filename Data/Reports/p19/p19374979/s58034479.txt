  The carina is difficult to visualize accurately but the ET tube is
  approximately 1-2 cm from the carina. Consider withdrawing 1-2 cm for more
  optimal positioning. Right PICC line terminates in the upper to mid SVC.
  Bilateral pleural effusions and mild cardiomegaly persist.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman now intubated  // pls eval for ett placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:29
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube is
 now within 2 cm of the carinal. Consider withdrawing by 1 cm. The tip of the
 right PICC line has been withdrawn. The tip of the line now projects over the
 mid SVC.  No evidence of complications. The parenchymal opacities at the right
 lung base and in the left upper lobe are constant in appearance. Unchanged
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
