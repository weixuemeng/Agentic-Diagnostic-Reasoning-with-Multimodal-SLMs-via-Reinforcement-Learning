                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturations after breast surgery.  Re-evaluate possible hilar
 abnormality seen in portable radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously seen hilar abnormality is likely tortuous and
 enlarged pulmonary vasculature, which may be related to underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 Hyperinflation, flattened hemidiaphragms, and parenchymal scarring suggest
 severe underlying COPD.  Chronic re-distribution of the pulmonary vasculature
 is noted.  There is no consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  A fluid level is visible in the left breast and compatible with
 post-surgical changes from the recent breast surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Severe COPD.
 3.  Previously seen hilar abnormality is likely tortuosity and enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. 
 4.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 5.  Post-surgical changes in the left breast.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5:10 p.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___.
