 FINDINGS:  A mass-like opacity is present in the right hilum,of unclear
 chronicity or significance.  It may be superimposition of prominent vascular
 structures or possibly a mass.  There is hyperinflation of the lungs and
 bullous disease at the right apex consistent with COPD.  There is no edema,
 consolidations, or significant atelectasis.  The heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal.  Calcification of the aortic arch is noted.
