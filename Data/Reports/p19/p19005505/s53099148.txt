                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, intracranial aneurysm, atelectasis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The current film is relatively underpenetrated.  
 
 Allowing for this, the lung volumes are borderline.  There is probable mild
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum appears prominent -- while this could represent
 a combination of a prominent ascending aorta and prominent hila due to
 pulmonary hypertension, it is not completely delineated on this exam. 
 
  There is upper zone re-distribution and mild vascular plethora.  No focal
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild upper zone re-distribution.
 
 2.  Prominence of the mediastinum, not fully characterized.  While this may be
 due to unfolding of the aorta and prominence of the hila due to pulmonary
 hypertension, this is not fully characterized on this exam.  Consider further
 assessment with PA and lateral chest x-ray and/or chest CT when clinically
 feasible.
 
 3.  No obvious consolidation or gross effusion.
