                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with possible angio ___  // pre op Surg:
 ___ (diagnostic angiogram)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal structure and transparency of the lung
 parenchyma.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion. A dense
 rounded structure in the right lung apex, projecting over the ventral part of
 the first right rib likely reflects that degenerative change in the
 sternocostal junction.
