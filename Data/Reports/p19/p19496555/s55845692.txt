                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GI bleed, known hiatal hernia.  // Please
 eval for presence of haital hernia      Please eval for presence of haital
 hernia
 
 COMPARISON:  THERE ARE NO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung base is markedly elevated, and mediastinum shifted to the right. 
 Plane of the left hemidiaphragm is impossible to assess.  Dilated loops of
 bowel and stomach project above both level of the left hemi thorax and across
 the midline posterior to the heart.  This could be a very large diaphragmatic
 hernia or ruptured diaphragm.
 
 Right hemidiaphragm is intact.  Aside from moderate degree of relaxation
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe lungs are clear.  Heart size is impossible
 to assess.  Pulmonary vasculature is appropriate given the compromise of left
 lower lobe function.  There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural
 effusion.
