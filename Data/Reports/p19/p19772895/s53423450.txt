                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman first post-partum day, history of tetralogy of
 Fallot.  Short of breath.  Desaturated.  Evaluate for evidence of heart
 failure.
 
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy, valve replacement and vascular stenting
 of the mediastinum.  Heart is at least moderately enlarged, partially obscured
 by scoliosis.
 Unfortunately without prior chest radiographs, it is difficult to say whether
 this constitutes a change in heart size, and whether small left pleural
 effusion and mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality are new findings.  The
 abnormal appearance of pulmonary vasculature could be due to bronchial artery
 dilatation, but this is another finding that should be evaluated in comparison
 to prior radiographs currently not available.  The position and orientation of
 the prosthetic valve and vascular stent also need to be examined.  In the
 absence of prior chest radiographs, I strongly recommend ultrasound study.
