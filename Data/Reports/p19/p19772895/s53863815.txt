                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 There is substantial dextroscoliosis.  The patient is after median sternotomy
 most likely devoted to congenital heart disease surgery.  There is a cardiac
 valve projecting over the left upper cardiac border most likely within the
 pulmonary arteries.  There is also a stent that potentially connects a shunt. 
 The findings might be consistent with a prior complex congenital heart disease
 repair.  There is stable appearance of apical scarring on the left.  There are
 no new consolidations to suggest interval development of infectious process.
