                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:11 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with tachycardia and desaturation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 5:26 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube previously obscured by spinal stabilization
 device is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 9 cm from the
 carina.  It should be advanced at least 4 cm.  Nasogastric tube passes at
 least as far as the mid stomach.  A loop of tubing projecting over the upper
 midline could be either in the hypopharynx or external.  These tube positions
 were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 11:48 p.m.
 
 Left PIC line passes at least as far as the mid SVC but its course is also
 obscured by a spinal rod.  Previous moderate left pleural effusion has
 virtually resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no longer any
 pulmonary edema, vascular congestion or atelectasis at the right base, but
 left lower lobe is now completely collapsed, explaining leftward shift of the
 heart, which is normal size.  Right clavicle and rib fractures noted.
