 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion appears minimally decreased in size
 compared to the prior study. Small left pleural effusion appears almost
 completely resolved. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No pneumothorax is identified. There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Moderate size right and small left pleural effusions, both of which have
 decreased since the previous study. Bibasilar atelectasis.
