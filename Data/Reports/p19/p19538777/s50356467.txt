                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Linear sclerosis in the left first rib may correspond to a healing
 prior fracture.  No acute fracture is detected on these views.  Lung volumes
 are slightly low.  Subtle opacity projecting over the right mid lung may
 represent bronchiectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Heart size is top normal.  Aortic calcifications are seen.  Note is made of
 calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, consistent with DISH.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Healing left first rib fracture without evidence for acute fracture. 
 However, dedicated rib series is more sensitive for rib fractures.
 2.  Right middle lobe bronchiectasis.
