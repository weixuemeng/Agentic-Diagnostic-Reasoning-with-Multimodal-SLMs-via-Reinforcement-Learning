                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, sepsis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  A large hiatal hernia causes apparent
 widening of the mediastinum.  In addition, there appears to be a new
 retrocardiac opacity.  There is no definite consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  New right-sided internal jugular line tip terminates at the mid
 SVC.  Sternotomy wires and retained internal pacing leads are in stable
 positions.  Aortic arch atherosclerosis and tortuosity are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and large hiatal hernia.  New retrocardiac
 opacity, potentially atelectasis, infection is also possible.  Repeat with PA
 and lateral views may help further characterize if patient is amenable.
