                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ON ___ AT 4:21 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question of right middle lobe pneumonia
 in ICU hypotensive with urosepsis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at
 12:13.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 4:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC.  The
 median sternotomy with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 Opacity along the right heart border and in the retrocardiac region likely
 representing known large hiatal hernia.  There are several coronary stents in
 place.  Lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. 
 There are likely small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with
 patchy retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  Streaky linear opacities
 in the right upper lung most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Prominent arterial calcification in the aorta as well as the
 splenic artery consistent with atherosclerosis.  Degenerative changes of the
 left glenohumeral joint.  No acute bony abnormality.
