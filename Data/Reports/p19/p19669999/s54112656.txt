                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again demonstrated is a very large hiatal hernia.  Allowing for
 relatively low lung volumes, heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta
 is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Increased opacity is seen overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 radiograph, and likely corresponds to bilateral small pleural effusions and
 adjacent atelectasis.  Compression deformity at thoracolumbar junction appears
 similar to recent thoracic spine radiograph of ___, and was more
 fully evaluated at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very large hiatal hernia. Adjacent bibasilar opacities favor
 atelectasis, but aspiration pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate
 setting.
