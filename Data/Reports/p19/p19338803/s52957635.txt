                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with recurrent pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates additional interval decrease in the left apical
 pneumothorax which is not visible at this point on the current radiograph on
 both PA and lateral projections.  Lungs are clear.  The evidence of the left
 upper lobe surgery is unchanged in appearance (suture chain).  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.
