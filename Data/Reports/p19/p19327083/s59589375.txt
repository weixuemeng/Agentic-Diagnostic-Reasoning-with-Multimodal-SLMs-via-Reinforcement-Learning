                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  The
 right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Given this, no
 large pleural effusion is seen.  Right basilar opacity is not optimally
 assessed and could be due to atelectasis/scarring, although underlying
 consolidation or aspiration is not excluded.  The left lung is clear.  The
 patient is rotated slightly to the right.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. 
 Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views if possible when patient able or repeat
 frontal view for further evaluation.  Right basilar opacity, difficult to
 assess whether atelectasis/scarring.  However, underlying consolidation due to
 aspiration or infection not excluded.
