                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough x 1 month, history of smoking,
 history of hypertension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains normal.  Mild atherosclerotic calcification is noted within
 a mildly tortuous aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours remain unchanged.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Left upper lobe consolidative opacity
 with convex outward borders remains unchanged from prior.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are again noted as well as
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change in left upper lobe consolidative opacity which
 may reflect pneumonia but malignancy is not excluded.  Follow up radiographs
 in 2 months is recommended after treatment to ensure resolution of this
 finding, as was previously recommended.
