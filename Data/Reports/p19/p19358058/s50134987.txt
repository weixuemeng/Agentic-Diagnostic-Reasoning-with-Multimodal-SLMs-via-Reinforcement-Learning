 CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Renal failure and hypotension, right IJ line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new right IJ line with tip in the mid SVC.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and a hazy
 right upper lobe alveolar infiltrate that is new compared to prior.  There is
 also some increased retrocardiac opacity.  The overlying impression is that of
 CHF that has worsened in the interval.  An underlying infectious infiltrate
 cannot be totally excluded.
