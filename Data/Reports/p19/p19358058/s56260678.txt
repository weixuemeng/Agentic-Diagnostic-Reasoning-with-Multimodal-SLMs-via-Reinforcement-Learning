                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.  
 
 There is substantial interval progression of the prior study with increase in
 the left lower lobe consolidation and substantial increase in the right lower
 lung consolidation.  The findings might be consistent with interval aspiration
 versus progression of the infectious process in the right lower lung.  Left
 lobe worsening atelectasis is another possibility in addition to the
 infectious process.  Right upper lobe opacities are noted and might be
 consistent with involvement by infectious process as well.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged including cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Substantial progression of multifocal consolidations, in particular in the
 right lower lung but also in the left lower lobe and right upper lung.
