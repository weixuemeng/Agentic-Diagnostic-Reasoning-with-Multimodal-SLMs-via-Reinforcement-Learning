 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear and
 patchy opacities in the right upper lobe and lung bases likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with atelectasis in the lung bases and right upper lobe,
 without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
