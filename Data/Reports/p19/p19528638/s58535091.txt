                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with TIA and history of stroke.  Evaluation of
 the heart and lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is a
 relative paucity of pulmonary vessels in the right upper lung and increased
 aeration at the retrosternal space, consistent with substantial pulmonary
 emphysema.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation, significant pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusion.  There is some right mid lung atelectasis as well
 as some left basilar atelectasis which is improved since the prior study.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Findings consistent with substantial pulmonary emphysema. 
 Improved right mid lung and left basilar atelectasis.
