                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, to assess for infiltrating congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no
 definite pneumonia or pleural effusion.  There is some increased prominence of
 pulmonary vessels that are indistinct, consistent with increasing pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Right subclavian catheter again extends to the upper portion
 of the SVC.
