                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recurrent fevers, wheeze, shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. 
 A small focus of increased opacification overlying the spine adjacent to the
 diaphragm, seen best on the lateral view may represent a small focus of
 airspace consolidation, less likely related to overlapping structure or
 changes related to the spine.  Heart is normal in size and cardiomediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. A small focus of rounded opacification overlying the lower thoracic spine
 may represent a small focus of pneumonia. 
 2. Re-evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiographs is recommended 4 weeks
 after completion of antibiotic therapy.
 
 Comment: Findings and recommendations were emailed to the "ED QA Nurses" to be
 directly communicated with the patient's primary care provider.
