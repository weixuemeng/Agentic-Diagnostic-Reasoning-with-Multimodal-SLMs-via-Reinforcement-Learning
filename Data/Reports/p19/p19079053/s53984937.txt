                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and 3., ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes continue to be low.  The cardiac silhouette continues to be
 enlarged, accentuated by the low lung volumes, and there is crowding of the
 central bronchovascular structures due to the low lung volumes.  There is
 bilaterally predominately upper lobe airspace opacity, likely reflecting
 pulmonary edema but infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bilateral upper lobe airspace opacities likely reflect
 pulmonary edema but infection cannot be excluded.
