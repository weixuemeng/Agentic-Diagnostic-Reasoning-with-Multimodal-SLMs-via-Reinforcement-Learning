                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with meningioma s/p resection who has rising
 WBC, increased O2 req.  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is persistent
 moderate cardiomegaly.  The right upper lobe airspace opacity now appears more
 confluent with air bronchograms.  This could reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema but infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 seen.  The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Airspace opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema versus infection.
