                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CNS bleed, new pneumonia, receiving blood
 transfusion, and now tachypnic, wheezing  // ? pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Even allowing for the projection, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There
 is persistent airspace opacity in the right upper lobe which may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection.  There is new partial
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to left lower lobe
 atelectasis or a layering pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is similar in degree when compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at the left lung base may reflect atelectasis or a layering
 pleural effusion.  Unchanged right upper lobe consolidation.
