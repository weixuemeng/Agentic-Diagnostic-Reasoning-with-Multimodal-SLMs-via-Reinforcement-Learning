                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea, leukocytosis  // eval for pulm
 edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  The comparison is made with prior studies including ___ at 08:30.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is some limitation due to poor inspiratory effort.  There are chronic
 cardiac monitoring leads and transfer device overlying the lower lung fields. 
 There is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular
 detail all consistent with CHF.  This is slightly more pronounced than on the
 earlier study.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and consolidation is likely
 in the left base.  There is a small area of patchy density in the right upper
 lobe.  There is no pneumothorax.
