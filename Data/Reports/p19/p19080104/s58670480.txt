                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with falls, confusion, delirium, mild hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky opacities seen
 within the right upper lobe as well as within the retrocardiac region.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacities in the right upper lobe and retrocardiac region may reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  Early infection in the right upper lobe however is not
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
