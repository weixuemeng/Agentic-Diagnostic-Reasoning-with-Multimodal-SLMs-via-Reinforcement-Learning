 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph provided.  Lung volumes are

 pneumothorax.  Tiny clips project over the right upper quadrant.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  The imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
