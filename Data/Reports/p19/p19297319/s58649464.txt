                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is exaggerated as a result of low lung
 volumes and appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 without pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible
 with areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are detected in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
