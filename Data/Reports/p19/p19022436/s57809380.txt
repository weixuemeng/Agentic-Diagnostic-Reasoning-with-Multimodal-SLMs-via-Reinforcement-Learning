                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 3 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic brain injury, drowning  // assess
 for aspiration      assess for aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The patient is intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
 projects approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The patient also carries a
 feeding tube.  The proximal parts of the tube might be coiled in the pharynx
 and needs to be repositioned.  The distal part of the tube only reaches the
 lower third of the esophagus, so that the tube needs to be advanced by
 approximately 20 cm.  A left subclavian line is in correct position, with the
 tip at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  In addition, a substantial consolidation is
 present, involving the entire left lower lobe as well as parts of the lingular
 and of the left upper lobe.  This consolidation causes blunting of the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour, the visualization of central air bronchograms and
 blunting of the aortopulmonary window.  Without comparison, it is not possible
 to differentiate pneumonia, atelectasis, or aspiration.  There also might be a
 small left pleural effusion.  The right lung is near normal, with only a
 minimal right basal and medial parenchymal opacity, mostly caused by
 underlying mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
