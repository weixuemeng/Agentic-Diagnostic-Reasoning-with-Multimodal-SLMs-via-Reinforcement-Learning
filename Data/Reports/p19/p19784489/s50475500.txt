                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status with question of intracranial hemorrhage. 
 Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Within the left retrocardiac region, projecting lateral to the
 costochondral calcifications, there is a 5.6 x 2.8 cm radiodense structure of
 uncertain etiology, possibly related to summation of normal thoracic
 structures.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is top normal in size. 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Marked dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Indeterminate 5.6 cm amorphous structure projecting over the left
 retrocardiac region.  While this may be related to summation of normal
 thoracic structures, further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral
 radiographs is recommended.
 
 Pertinent findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by
 Dr. ___ at 3:35 p.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
