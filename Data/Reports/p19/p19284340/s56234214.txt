                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer, now with
 abdominal pain and near-syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT chest dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to prior chest radiographs, there has been interval
 removal of the Port-A-Cath.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.  Minimal linear density in the
 left mid lung may represent a focus of atelectasis or post-radiation change. 
 The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Heart size is within normal limits,
 particularly given AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
