                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ethylene glycol poisoning.  Evaluation
 for consolidation or infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates interval improvement
 of interstitial edema and left lung base opacity since the prior study.  There
 is some interval worsening, however, of the right lung base medially, likely
 representing atelectasis.  There is also a small left pleural effusion.  The
 previously seen right and left internal jugular catheters are unchanged in
 position since the prior exam.  There has been interval removal of the
 nasogastric tube.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in interstitial edema and left lung base
 opacity.  Mild worsening of right medial lung base, likely representing
 atelectasis. Follow up radiographs may be helpful to exclude pneumonia.
