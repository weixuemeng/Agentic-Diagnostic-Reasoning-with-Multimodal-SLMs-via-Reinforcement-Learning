                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation and sepsis.  Evaluate
 tube placement as well as pulmonary processes.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen performed approximately 40 minutes prior to this
 study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded accounting for some vascular
 crowding.  Bilateral hilar prominence is related to supine positioning rather
 than vascular engorgement.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends
 approximately 1.5 cm above the carina but the patient's neck is seen to be in
 flexion.  A nasogastric tube has the side port in the stomach and the tip out
 of view.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process although assessment
 limited by positioning and expiratory phase radiograph. Repetition of the exam
 during appropriate inspiration is recommended.
