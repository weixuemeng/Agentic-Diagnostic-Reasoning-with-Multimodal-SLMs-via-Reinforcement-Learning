                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, rule out pneumonia, pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, the right-sided catheter has been replaced with a
 dual-lumen catheter with distal tip overlying upper right atrium.  The
 previously seen right and left IJ lines have been removed.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  There is upper
 zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF --
 allowing for technical differences, this is similar to prior.  Again seen are
 small bilateral effusions with some underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiopulmonary findings are similar to ___, with mild
 cardiomegaly and CHF with interstitial edema.  Bilateral small effusions with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
