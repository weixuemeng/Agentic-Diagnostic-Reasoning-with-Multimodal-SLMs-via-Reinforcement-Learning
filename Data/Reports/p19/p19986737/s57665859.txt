                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Large opacity projecting over the left
 mid to lower lung fields with subtle air bronchograms seen is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  No definite pleural effusion is seen, although small left pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
