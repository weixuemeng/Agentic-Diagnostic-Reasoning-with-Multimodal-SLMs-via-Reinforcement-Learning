 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:27 PM
  Increased opacification of the left lung base, which is likely real but may be
  at least in part due to lower lung volumes. Likely pleural effusion with
  subjacent atelectasis; additional causes of consolidation are also possible,
  such as infection. Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 6:26 p.m. on

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with  A Fib, CKD with shortness of breath  //
 Whether patient is in heart failure
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 12:40.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion continues to increase.  Significant atelectasis
 in the left lower lung is secondary. Right lung is alone volume but
 essentially clear.  Left heart border is obscured by pleural fluid but the
 right heart border unremarkable.
 
 Dual channel right supraclavicular hemodialysis catheter sat ends in the right
 atrium, as before. No pneumothorax.  The size and shape of the cardiac
 silhouette raise the possibility of pericardial effusion as well as persistent
 cardiomegaly.
