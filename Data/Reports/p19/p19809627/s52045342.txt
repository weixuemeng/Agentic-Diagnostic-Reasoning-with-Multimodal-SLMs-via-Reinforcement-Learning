                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, DM (cb retinopathy), CAD (sp stent x
 3), CKD (___), DVTs (on AC, sp filter), systolic dysfunction (EF ___%) pw cough
 and dyspnea.  // r/o acute process, assess progression of pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is of dense retrocardiac opacity.  Most compatible with left lower
 lobe infiltrate. There is probably a small associated pleural effusion.
 However there is minimal if any vascular redistribution and therefore this is
 felt to be more likely infectious than due to pulmonary edema. The heart
 continues to be severely enlarged there is a large bore right IJ line with tip
 in the right atrium
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued large left infiltrate.
