 AP CHEST, 9:20 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  C. difficile sepsis.  Chest pain and tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 A change in configuration of the right lung base may indicate increased or new
 small right pleural effusion.  Mild increase in opacification of the
 infrahilar left lower lobe, probably atelectasis.  Moderate-sized hiatus
 hernia is chronic, but little more can be said about that on this study. 
 Electronic pacer leads head upwards into the neck from bilateral pectoral
 pacemakers.
