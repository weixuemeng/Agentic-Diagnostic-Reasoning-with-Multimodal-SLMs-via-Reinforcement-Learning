                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status and sepsis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a
 pleural effusion.  Evidence of hiatal hernia is again seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Bilateral vagal nerve
 stimulators are again seen, without significant change in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to
 trace pleural effusion.  Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity most likely
 relates to atelectasis/scarring and was also seen on the prior study.
