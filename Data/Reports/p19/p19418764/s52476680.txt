                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  In the lateral view, there is a
 rounded opacity in the upper anterior mediastinum, which is thought to be
 inferior to an external clip in the right mid lung, between the posterior ribs
 six and seven.  There is some opacification of the right cardiophrenic angle
 which may represent a prominent epicardial fat pad.  No other focal opacities
 are identified.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Rounded opacity in the anterior upper mediastinum seen in the lateral view
 as well as an ill-defined opacity between the posterior portion of the right
 sixth and seventh rib as described above may represent focal consolidation or
 nodule.  Further assessment with chest CT is recommended.
 
 2.  Ill-defined opacification of the right cardiophrenic angle is also
 assessed in the lateral view and likely represents a prominent epicardial fat
 pad.
