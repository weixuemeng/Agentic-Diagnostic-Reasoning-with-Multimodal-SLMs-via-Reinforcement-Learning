                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is slightly larger than on the prior exam.  On the
 lateral film, there is increased opacity at the posterior CP angle.  This is
 not definitively seen on the frontal film and could represent an area of
 atelectasis or infiltrate.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.
