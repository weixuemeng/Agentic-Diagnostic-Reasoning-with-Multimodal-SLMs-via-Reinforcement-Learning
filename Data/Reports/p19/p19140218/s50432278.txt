                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ WITH COMPARISON RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Apparent
 elevation of right hemidiaphragm probably reflects a subpulmonic right pleural
 effusion with adjacent partial atelectasis of the right middle and right lower
 lobes.  On the left, there is a moderate pleural effusion with worsening
 adjacent retrocardiac atelectasis and/or consolidation.
