                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and chest pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with aorta appearing tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The hilar contours are
 normal, and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggests trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases may also
 reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
