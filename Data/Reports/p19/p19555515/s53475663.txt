                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough and chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite change
 in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Mild enlargement of the heart with
 tortuosity of the aorta without vascular congestion.
 
 On the lateral view, there is a vague suggestion of some increased
 opacification overlying the anterior portion of several lower thoracic
 vertebrae.  This most likely represents vascular structures, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia cannot
 be unequivocally excluded.
