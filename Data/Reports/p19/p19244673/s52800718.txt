                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post foreign body esophageal impaction, no longer present
 with wheezing.  Please evaluate for infiltrate, effusion, evidence of
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Full prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is new.  There are no other focal
 airspace opacities to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has
 not significantly changed.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests
 possible small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis and possible small left pleural effusion. 
 
 2.  Aspiration cannot be excluded on this study.  Portable AP radiograph does
 not optimally evaluate for aspiration; a PA and lateral radiograph is
 recommended for further evaluation.
