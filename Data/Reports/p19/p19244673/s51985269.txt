                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Pulmonary vasculature appears mildly indistinct
 suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Linear and patchy
 bibasilar atelectasis is noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Punctate calcification in
 the left apex may be vascular in origin.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and probable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
