  There has been interval development of a moderate right subpulmonic pleural
  effusion.  There is also a small left pleural effusion.  There is persistent
  mild pulmonary edema.  Multi focal atelectasis is noted.  There is no
  pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative changes are seen at the left shoulder.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with hypoxia and fever, after
 recent surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes with increased
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Bilateral
 opacities are consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema, unchanged. 
 Volume loss in the right hemithorax is likely related to a PERSISTENT
 subpulmonic pleural effusion.  THERE MAY BE a new small left pleural effusion.
 No pneumothorax is visualized.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 2. Low lung volumes, with unchanged mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 3. PERSISTENT SMALL TO MODERATE SUBPULMONIC RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION.  PROBABLE
 NEW SMALL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION.
