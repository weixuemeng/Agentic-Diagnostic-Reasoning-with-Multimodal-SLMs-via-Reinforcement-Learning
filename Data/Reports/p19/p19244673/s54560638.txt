 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased shortness of breath, expiratory wheezing, evaluation
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Areas of scarring and atelectasis at the lung bases, slightly
 improved lung volumes, reflecting improved ventilation.  No new parenchymal
 opacity suggestive of acute pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.  Known bilateral apical thickening that is symmetrical.  Severe
 degenerative left shoulder changes are better seen than on the previous
 examination.
