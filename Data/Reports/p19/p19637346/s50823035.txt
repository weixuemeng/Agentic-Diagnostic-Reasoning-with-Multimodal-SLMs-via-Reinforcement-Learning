                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute change in mental status.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques.  These are identified along the diaphragmatic pleural surfaces, as
 well as anteriorly, posteriorly and along the mediastinum.  Please note that
 these plaques and lack of prior to evaluate for change limits sensitivity for
 detection of subtle underlying parenchymal opacity although no clear
 consolidation is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques which limits detection for subtle
 parenchymal opacity, especially given lack of priors to evaluate for interval
 change.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
