                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with elevated white count  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the right lung, small to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 Additional opacity of the right lung base is also similar in appearance, and
 this may be due to infectious consolidation or layering of the pleural
 effusion.  The left lung is essentially clear.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary
 edema. Stable cardiomegaly. The aortic root stent graft is unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Unchanged small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 2.  The right lung base opacity could be explained by a layering pleural
 effusion or pneumonia.  Correlate clinically with signs of infection.
