                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right pleural effusion has increased and is now moderate in size with
 overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There may
 be a very trace left pleural effusion, decreased in size since the prior.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 Evidence of hiatal hernia is again seen.  The lateral view is suboptimal due
 to the patient's overlying arm.  A few punctate calcifications in the lung
 apices may represent calcified granulomas or may be related to scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right pleural effusion which is now moderate, with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Trace left pleural
 effusion, slightly decreased.
