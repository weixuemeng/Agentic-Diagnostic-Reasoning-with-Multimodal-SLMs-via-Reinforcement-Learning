                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  There is increase in degree of the opacity at the right lung
 base likely due to pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, noting
 infection is not excluded.  There is also a small left pleural effusion, new
 since prior.  Retrocardiac opacity is in part due to known hiatal hernia.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.  Core-valve is also seen,
 similar to prior.  Degenerative changes seen at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity compatible with pleural effusion and likely
 atelectasis, noting infection cannot be excluded.  It appears increased in
 degree when compared to prior.  New left-sided effusion.
