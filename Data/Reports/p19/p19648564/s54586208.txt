                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath post valve placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, which appears smaller in size as compared to the prior study
 given differences in technique.  Retrocardiac air-fluid level is most
 consistent with a hiatal hernia.  There is adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Small scattered calcified nodular opacities in both lungs are likely due to
 prior granulomatous disease.  Core-valve placement.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 assess due to the right base opacity.  Mediastinal contours are grossly
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema.  
 
 Hiatal hernia.
