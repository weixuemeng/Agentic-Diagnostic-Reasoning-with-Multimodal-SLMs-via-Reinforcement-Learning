                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are somewhat difficult to
 assess owing to persistent opacification of the right lower hemithorax.  The
 patient is status post aortic valve replacement using an endoluminal approach.
 A moderate hiatal hernia is noted, similar to prior findings.  Opacification
 of the right lower hemithorax which probably relates to elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, atelectasis, and possibly a pleural effusion, appears very
 similar to both prior studies without clear change.  The right
 acromioclavicular joint is again widened and irregular.  Moderate incompletely
 characterized degenerative changes affect each shoulder.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.  No definite acute process. 
 Suspicion for persistent pleural effusion and atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  Hiatal hernia.
