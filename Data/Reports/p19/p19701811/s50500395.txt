                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with low oxygen saturations on room air,
 question consolidation, question atelectasis, status post ORIF of the left
 femur fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:37.
 
 Portable AP upper chest film, ___ at 11:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Given differences in positioning, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  Calcification in the aortic knob is seen consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  The lungs demonstrate interstitial prominence, which appears
 to be chronic.  No evidence of pulmonary edema at this time.  No focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Streaky opacities at the right
 base most likely reflect patchy atelectasis.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
