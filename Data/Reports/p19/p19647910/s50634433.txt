                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ w/ ESRD on HD now s/p DDRT ___. Portable CXR yesterday
 concerning for L eventration  // assess L hemidiaphragm
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, right internal jugular catheter
 continues to terminate in the right atrium.  The previously described left
 ___- diaphragmatic abnormality is not well demonstrated on this portable
 radiograph. For more complete assessment, a standard lateral chest radiograph
 is recommended when the patient's condition permits. Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for patchy bibasilar opacities which likely represent atelectasis,
 although differential diagnosis includes aspiration and infectious pneumonia.
