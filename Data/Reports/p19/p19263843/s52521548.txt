                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Scarring is demonstrated
 within the lung apices.  Hazy ovoid opacification is seen projecting over the
 medial aspect of the left apex measuring approximately 2.7 x 1.5 cm, not seen
 on the previous study or on the lateral, and could potentially be artifactual.
 Remainder of the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications
 are seen in the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy ovoid opacity projecting over the medial aspect of the left apex, not
 seen on the lateral view, could be artifactual.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider repeat PA view with obliques for further
 assessment.
