 pna or other pulm process, please do on AM ICU rounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian line tip is at the level of proximal right atrium. Heart size
 and mediastinum are overall unchanged but there is new atelectasis in the
 right upper lobe and slight improvement of lower lobe atelectasis.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.  No definitive new focus of infection is seen but
 some of those areas that are presumably atelectasis might represent focus of
 infection. Continued attention on the subsequent radiographs is required.
