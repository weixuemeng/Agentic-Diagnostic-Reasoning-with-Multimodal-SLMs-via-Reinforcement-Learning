 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:13 PM
  There has been a slight interval increase in opacity at the left lung base,
  likely secondary to atelectasis however an acute infectious process cannot be
  excluded. Right perihilar opacity concerning for aspiration/pneumonia, as
  mentioned on the prior exam is difficult to assess on this exam secondary to
  patient rotation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Again seen is a left PICC line, with tip near the SVC/RA junction.
 
 There are markedly low inspiratory volumes, which limits assessment of the
 pulmonary parenchyma. There is also slightly rotated positioning. 
 
 Allowing for this, there is patchy opacity at the left base, with partial
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and possibility of an early pneumonic
 infiltrate or area of aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  There is pulmonary vascular plethora, while this could
 relate to CHF/fluid overload, though this is also likely accentuated by the
 low lung volumes.  Opacity at the right cardiophrenic region is again seen and
 could relate to known prior aspiration.
