                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  A subcentimeter well-circumscribed nodular opacity
 overlies the sixth left anterior rib level and is not clearly visualized on
 prior radiographs.  Although potentially due to a nipple shadow, a small
 nodular opacity is also observed in the retrosternal region on the lateral
 view, raising the concern for a possible lingular lung nodule.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions.  Postoperative changes
 are present in the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable lung nodule versus nipple shadow.  Initial further
 evaluation with repeat radiograph with nipple markers is recommended, as
 communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:09 a.m. at the
 time of discovery.
