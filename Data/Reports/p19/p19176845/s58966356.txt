                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Brain tumor requiring intubation and OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating
 approximately 4 cm above the carina at the level of the thoracic inlet.  An OG
 tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper
 quadrant, likely within the stomach.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Multiple opacities predominantly in the left mid lung zone may represent
 multifocal infection or malignancy. There is also retrocardiac opacification
 and subtle increased density in the right lung base. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate position of support devices.
 2.  Multifocal opacities predominantly in the left mid lung zone could
 represent multifocal infection or malignant involvement.  Further evaluation
 with dedicated CT of the chest is recommended.
