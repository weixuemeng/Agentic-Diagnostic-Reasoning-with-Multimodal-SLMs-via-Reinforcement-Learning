                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Compared with prior there has been
 essentially complete resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle may be due to trace effusion.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation to suggest infection or
 aspiration.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median sternotomy
 wires are again noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Essentially complete resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions with
 possible trace effusion on the right.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
