                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, eval for pneumonia  // acute
 process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal contour is similar,
 with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications seen throughout the aorta.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged, with mild vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded. The lungs are
 hyperinflated. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Old
 right-sided rib fractures are again seen. Bilateral humeral prostheses are
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar patchy opacities, possibly
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
