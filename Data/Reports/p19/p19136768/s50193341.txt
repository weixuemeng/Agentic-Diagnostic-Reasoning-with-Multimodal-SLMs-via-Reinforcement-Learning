                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right-sided weakness and mildly slurred
 speech, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 There is linear atelectasis/scarring in the lingula.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No focal consolidation is seen.
 Bilateral humeral prostheses are partially imaged.  Note is made of old right
 rib fractures and evidence of osteolysis of the right distal clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular linear atelectasis/scarring.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
