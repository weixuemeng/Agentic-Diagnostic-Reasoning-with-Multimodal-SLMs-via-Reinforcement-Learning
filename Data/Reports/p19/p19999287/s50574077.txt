                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  known SCC presenting with dyspnea  // evolving infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous examination, there is a massive progression. Known
 mediastinal ___ and known left-sided bronchial stent. However, the stent
 appears to be partially occluded, causing atelectasis and very widespread
 parenchymal opacities in the entire ventilated left lung.  At the level of the
 left apex, an upper lobe atelectasis appears to have occurred.  Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm cannot be excluded.  Extensive perihilar consolidation.
 Minimal progression of pre-existing subtle right basal peribronchial
 opacities, documented on the CT examination from the ___.
