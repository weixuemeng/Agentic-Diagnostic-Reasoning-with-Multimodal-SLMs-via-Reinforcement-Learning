                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobe resection for carcinoma.  Reported 2 cm left lower
 lobe lesion.  Decreased breath sounds on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to a series of chest CT scans, most
 recently ___:
 
 ___ x 22 mm elliptical opacity projecting over the cardiac apex on the frontal
 view could be the lung nodule referenced.  I cannot identify it on the
 lateral.  Loss of volume in the right lung is attributable to right upper
 lobectomy and obscuration of the right heart border and anterior aspect of the
 right hemidiaphragm could be due to anatomic rearrangement stemming from
 surgery.  Upper lungs are clear.  The heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is
 mildly dilated and very tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion.  I see no
 explanation for decreased breath sounds in the left lower chest, except the
 patient has moderately extensive emphysema generally.
 
 There is suggestion of additional small lung nodules in the left lower lobe,
 projecting over the descending thoracic aorta, and perhaps in one of the upper
 lobes retrosternally on the lateral view projecting just superior to the
 ascending thoracic aorta.  The reference chest CT scans should be reviewed
 with that in mind.
