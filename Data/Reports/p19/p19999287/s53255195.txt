                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PNA and worsening dyspnea, history lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   In this patient with known left lower
 lobe mass, a fiducial marker projects over the cardiac silhouette. There is
 interval improvement in overall aeration in the left upper lobe. Mild
 persistent perihilar opacity persists which may represent residual atelectasis
 or may be related to known hilar mass. There is stable blunting of the right
 CP angle which may represent pleural thickening or tiny effusion. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged. The imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration in the left upper lobe. Persistent perihilar opacity and
 left lower lobe mass as seen on prior PET-CT.
