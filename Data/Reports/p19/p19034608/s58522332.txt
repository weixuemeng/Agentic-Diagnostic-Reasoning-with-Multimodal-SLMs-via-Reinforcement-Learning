 HISTORY:  Cough and intermittent fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Ill-defined patchy opacity within
 the left lower lobe is concerning for an area of developing infection. 
 Minimal streaky opacity in the right lung base may also reflect an infectious
 process or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe is concerning for an area of
 developing infection.  Streaky opacity in the right lung base is nonspecific
 and may reflect an area of atelectasis or additional area of infection.
