                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities within the lung bases,
 left greater than right, likely represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis as
 seen on concurrent CT.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles corresponds
 with small effusion seen on concurrent CT.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is a small hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar linear opacities most suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
