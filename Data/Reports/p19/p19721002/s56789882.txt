 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:56 AM
  1.  Persistent pleural-based right upper lobe opacity with central lucency is
  similar to ___ with possible progression of superior aspect since
  ___. Findings may represent recurrent pneumonia however given
  persistence over multiple studies adenocarcinoma is on the differential.
  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph 6 weeks post resolution of symptoms to
  assess for interval change.
  2. Diffuse interstitial lung disease, better assessed on CT chest from ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, working diagnosis of ILD, hypoxia.  Assess for
 acute cardiopulmonary process, edema, effusion, infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated with a reticular pattern predominately
 involving the lower lobes consistent with history of interstitial lung
 disease.  Heterogeneous pleural-based right upper lobe opacity with associated
 rounded lucency centrally is unchanged from ___ with possible
 progression of its superior most component since ___.  No new opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent pleural-based right upper lobe opacity with central lucency is
 similar to ___ with possible progression of superior aspect since
 ___.  Findings may represent recurrent pneumonia however given
 persistence over multiple studies adenocarcinoma is on the differential.
 2.  Diffuse interstitial lung disease, better assessed on CT chest from ___.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph 6 weeks post
 resolution of symptoms to assess for interval change.
