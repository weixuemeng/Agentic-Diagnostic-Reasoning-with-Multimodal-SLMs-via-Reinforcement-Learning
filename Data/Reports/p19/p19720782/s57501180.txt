                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is densely calcified.  The
 mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Right hilar opacity is similar to the
 previous examinations.  Rounded opacity projecting over the right mid lung
 field likely reflects fluid loculated within the major fissure. A moderate
 right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion are noted, and there is
 mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  Emphysematous changes are again seen in the lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema and moderate size right and small left pleural
 effusions.  Small amount of fluid is loculated within the right major fissure.
 2. Patchy opacity in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
 3. Unchanged chronic right hilar opacity.
