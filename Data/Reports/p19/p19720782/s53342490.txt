                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with foreign body
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Again demonstrated within the right upper lobe and
 perihilar region is a chronic area of opacification compatible with radiation
 fibrosis.  Streaky right lower lobe consolidative opacity is also chronic.
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted
 at the aortic arch.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is re- demonstrated. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are again noted.
 Streaky left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded. Known spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe is better assessed on
 the previous CT. No pneumothorax is present. Multilevel degenerative changes
 are again seen in the thoracic spine.  No radiopaque foreign body identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left. Radiation fibrosis in the right upper lobe and right
 perihilar region and chronic consolidative opacity in the right lower lobe.
 Streaky left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.  No radiopaque foreign body identified.
