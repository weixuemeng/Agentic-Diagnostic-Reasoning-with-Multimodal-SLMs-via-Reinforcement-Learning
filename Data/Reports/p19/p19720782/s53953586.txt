                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, COPD, and small cell lung cancer in the
 past.  Please assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___ and a
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a persistent right mediastinal opacity
 consistent with radiation fibrosis from known lung cancer treatment.  A right
 lower lobe loculated effusion appears unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and left hilar contours are normal.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Essentially unchanged right paramediastinal fibrosis with a loculated right
 lower lobe effusion.
