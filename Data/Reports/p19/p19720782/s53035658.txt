                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia, history of nonsmall cell lung
 cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  Loculated right
 pleural effusion is again seen, with compressive lower lobe atelectasis
 unchanged.  There is right perihilar opacity which likely reflects known
 fibrosis as seen on prior CT.  New consolidation is seen.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of the chest with findings of right pleural
 effusion, loculated and lower lobe atelectasis as well as right perihilar
 fibrosis is unchanged.  Please refer to subsequent CTA chest for further
 details.
