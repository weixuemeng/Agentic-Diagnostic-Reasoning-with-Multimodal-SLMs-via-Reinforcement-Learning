                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p radiation
 and severe emphysema presenting with dyspena, treating for COPD exacerbation,
 CXR on admission with ?fluid in the right major fissure.  // Evaluate for
 interval change, particularly of the right major fissue and note of fluid on
 prior CXR.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study the pseudotumor (fluid in the major fissure) on the
 right has resolved.  Post treatment changes including elevation of the right
 hilus and coarse interstitial changes indicative of radiation fibrosis are
 again noted, a chronic finding.  Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 likely a function of atelectasis and a small pleural effusion.  The left lung
 is largely clear.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  Heavily
 calcified aortic arch is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Resolution of fluid in the right major fissure.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.
 3.  Chronic treatment-related changes in the right lung.
