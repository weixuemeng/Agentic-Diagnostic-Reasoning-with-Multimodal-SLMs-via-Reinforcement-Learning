                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia to ___%  // assess for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam. Heart size remains
 within normal limits. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Within the right upper
 lobe and perihilar region, there is chronic opacification compatible with
 radiation fibrosis.  Mild pulmonary edema is demonstrated with perhaps slight
 enlargement of a moderate size right pleural effusion which is partially
 loculated superiorly and medially. Right basilar opacification may reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with moderate right pleural effusion, perhaps slightly
 increased compared to the prior study. Chronic opacity within the right upper
 lobe and perihilar region is compatible with radiation fibrosis. Right basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is not completely excluded.
