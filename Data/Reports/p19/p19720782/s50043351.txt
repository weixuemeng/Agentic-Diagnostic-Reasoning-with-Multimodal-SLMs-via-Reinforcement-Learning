                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, dyspnea. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CTA chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right pleural effusion which is unchanged since prior
 exam.  Again seen is a right hilar opacity consistent with fibrosis, better
 assessed on recent CT.  A subtle left lower lobe opacity is seen, which may
 represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior
 exam.  Visualized osseus structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Subtle left lower lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis, but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  PA and lateral radiographs could allow for
 better assessment of this opacity.
 
 2.  Stable right pulmonary effusion.
