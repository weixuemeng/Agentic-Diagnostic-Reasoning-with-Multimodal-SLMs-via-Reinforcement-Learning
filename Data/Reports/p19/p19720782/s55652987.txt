 suggestive of an effusion, similar in size when compared to prior.  There is
 also pulmonary vascular congestion, increased compared to prior.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Elevation of the right hilum with increased density in the right paratracheal
 region compatible with prior post-treatment changes, better characterized on
 prior CT.

 congestion.
