                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, dyspnea and hypoxia.  Evaluate for heart failure
 or a pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.  There is increased opacity at the
 right lung base with inferior displacement of the major fissure.  There are
 likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 Calcifications are seen within the aorta and right upper lung.
 
 Left-sided AICD is present with a lead terminating in the right ventricle. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Heterotopic
 calcification is seen within the right glenohumeral joint. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Right lower lower lobe partial atelectasis. Coexisting pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in this region.  Follow up CXR is recommended to ensure resolution.
