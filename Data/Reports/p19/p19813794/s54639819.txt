                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of COPD and CHF, now with increasing O2 requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest dated ___, and
 radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are decreased lung volumes bilaterally.  The patient is status post
 CABG, with sternotomy wires prior noted to be well aligned.  There is a single
 lead ICD overlying the left chest, with its lead extending into the right
 ventricle.  There has been interval worsening of bibasilar opacities,
 suggesting of either aspiration or atelectasis.  Redemonstrated is stable,
 pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema.  There are new, small,
 bilateral pleural effusions identified.  The patient's known left lower lobe
 mass is obscured on this radiograph, and better characterized on the recent CT
 chest examination.  There is stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening bibasilar opacities, suggestive of aspiration or atlectasis
 given rapid change from recent CT of ___.
 
 2.  Stable pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
