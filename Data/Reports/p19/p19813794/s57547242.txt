                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with mild
 engorgement, consistent with mild pulmonary congestion.  Focal opacity at the
 lung bases seen on the lateral projection is most likely atelectasis; however,
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles
 bilaterally likely due to small pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is top normal.  Left chest wall pacemaker is seen with lead in the
 right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema and possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Focal basilar opacity is likely atelectasis; however, infection cannot be
 excluded.
