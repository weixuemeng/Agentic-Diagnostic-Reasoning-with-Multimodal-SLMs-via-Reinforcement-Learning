                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, not sure of mechanical or syncopal, noted some
 back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Single-lead left-sided pacemaker
 is again seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right
 atrium.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta remains calcified
 and tortuous.  Bilateral interstitial opacities and central vascular
 prominence is stable compared to the prior study suggesting mild interstitial
 edema.  Posterior basilar opacity on the lateral view is grossly similar as
 compared to the study from ___ and may represent atelectasis/scarring
 although infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 right costophrenic angle remains blunted on the frontal image.  Mild biapical
 pleural thickening with calcification.  No definite fracture is seen, although
 evaluation is not optimal for such.  This study does not well assess the
 spine.  If there is clinical concern for spine or rib fracture, dedicated
 imaging of the spine or ribs should be obtained.
