                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS on ECMO  // eval for OGT termination
 site
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 03:12.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ECMO cannula extends from the right internal jugular through the inferior vena
 cava, as before. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the proximal right pulmonary
 artery.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Left internal jugular line ends
 from the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion if present is
 small to moderate on the right, minimal on the left. Heart is not enlarged.
 
 Right lung volume is smaller than the left, and smaller now than it was at
 03:00. Therefore concurrent atelectasis is at least partially responsible for
 the probe aggressive consolidation of the right lung. Heterogeneous
 opacification in the left lung though severe, has been relatively stable.
