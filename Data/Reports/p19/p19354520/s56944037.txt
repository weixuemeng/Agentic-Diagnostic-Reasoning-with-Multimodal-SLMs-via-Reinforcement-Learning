                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with blunt trauma with right frontal bone fx with
 pneumocephalus, intubation complicated by aspiration, w ARDS and aspiration
 pneumonia, s/p ecmo. s/p trach/PEG ___  ___/ eval post op changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT ___ and chest radiograph ___ TdT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumoperitoneum is present, and has been more fully evaluated on subsequent
 abdominal CT ___.  Endotracheal tube has been exchanged for a
 tracheostomy tube, and a nasogastric tube is been removed. Low lung volumes
 accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Persistent
 pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by apparent worsening
 asymmetrically distributed lung opacities predominantly involving the
 perihilar regions in left upper lobe. These findings could be due to
 multifocal infection with or without coexisting pulmonary edema.
