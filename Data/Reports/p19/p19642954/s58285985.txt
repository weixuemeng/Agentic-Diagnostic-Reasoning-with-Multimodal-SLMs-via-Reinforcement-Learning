                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and new pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including the most recent chest radiograph
 from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right IJ central venous catheter with the catheter tip at the
 superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 Again noted are relatively stable bilateral opacities in the mid-to-lower lung
 fields which are suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Heart size
 remains normal and mediastinal veins continue to be dilated.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral opacities in the mid-to-lower lung fields are more
 suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural
 effusions.
