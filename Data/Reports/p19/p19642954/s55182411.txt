                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and sepsis.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with
 the tip in the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is borderline high at the level
 of the clavicles, approximately 6.5 cm from the carina, similar to the prior
 exam.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field
 of view.
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes have improved.  There is persistent
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No new opacities identified.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, similar to
 prior exams.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved lung volumes; otherwise, no significant change from the
 prior exam.
