                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications in a patient with mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and aortic tortuosity.  This could well reflect worsening pulmonary
 edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be seriously considered.
 
 Little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices.
