                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, rising white count, pleural effusions,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___, 17:06 p.m.  
 
 Since the ___ CXR, the left IJ central line has been removed.  Again seen
 is an orogastric type tube.  The tip is not well visualized on these images. 
 Additional tubing overlies the upper abdomen, not fully evaluated.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, overall similar to prior.  There
 is diffuse increased opacity throughout both lungs.  This could represent a
 combination of previously seen CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema.  New
 more ill-defined focal opacities in the right upper and mid zone are now seen
 -- ?  early foci of alveolar edema, right greater than left.  However, the
 differential diagnosis includes areas of pneumonic infiltrate, early septic
 emboli, or ARDS.  Probable small bilateral effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Cardiomegaly with suspected CHF.
 
 2) New multifocal patchy opacities in right greater than left upper zones. 
 Differential diagnosis includes foci of alveolar edema, multifocal pneumonia,
 early septic emboli, and ARDS.
