                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:16 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated with respiratory failure, assess
 pneumonia for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:10 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ a 4:16 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right pacer again are seen and
 unchanged.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in positioning.  There are patchy bilateral airspace
 opacities which have improved in the left upper lobe, but have increased in
 the left lower lung.  These findings still would favor pulmonary edema,
 although a diffuse infectious process could also have this appearance. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
