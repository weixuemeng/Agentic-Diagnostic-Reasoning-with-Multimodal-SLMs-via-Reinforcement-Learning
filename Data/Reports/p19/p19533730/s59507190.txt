                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 4:10 AM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, pulmonary edema, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 4:18.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:10 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right-sided pacer are unchanged in
 position.  There continues to be a bilateral airspace process with fluctuating
 areas of more confluent opacification.  Given the interval changes, this would
 favor pulmonary edema over an infectious process.  There is likely a layering
 left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely unchanged with the heart being stably enlarged.
