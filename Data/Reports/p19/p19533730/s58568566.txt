 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, status post re-intubation, evaluation for
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, little overall change is

 right pectoral pacemaker is constant in appearance.  The lung volumes are
 normal.  There are signs of moderate pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis and right basal atelectasis are unchanged.  Also unchanged is the
 extent and dimension of the known right upper lobe rounded parenchymal
 opacity.  No evidence of larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
