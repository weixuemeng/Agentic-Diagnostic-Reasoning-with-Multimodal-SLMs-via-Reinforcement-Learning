                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout image from a CT angiogram dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A subtle area of opacity has developed in the right infrahilar
 region, partially obscuring the right heart border.  This represents a change
 in the appearance of the chest compared to the tomogram from the previous CT
 angiogram performed ___.  It is concerning for a focal pneumonia
 in the context of fever and cough.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are
 no pleural effusions.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Skeletal structures are remarkable for a pectus deformity and degenerative
 changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New focal right middle lobe opacity, concerning for an early
 focus of infectious pneumonia.  Consider followup chest x-rays in four to six
 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy to document resolution.  
 
 Dr. ___ has been notified of this finding by e-mail with receipt of email
 acknowledgment on ___.
