                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with dyspnea.  Rule out pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, consistent with known diagnosis of COPD.    Increased pulmonary
 markings likely reflect chronic changes.  There is upper lobe scarring with
 tenting of the hila bilaterally. There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax. Posterior basal opacity, seen best on the lateral view, is
 unchanged and could represent a small pleural effusion or a Bochdalek hernia. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
