 Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated and there is parenchymal distortion suggestive of underlying
 emphysema with bullous changes involving both apices.  There is improving
 aeration in the right mid-to-lower lung suggesting resolving pneumonia or
 aspiration or pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The
 pulmonary arteries remain enlarged, suggestive of underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  No pneumothorax.
