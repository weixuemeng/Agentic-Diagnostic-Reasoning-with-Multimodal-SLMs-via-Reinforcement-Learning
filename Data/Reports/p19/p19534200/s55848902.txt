 The lungs are hyperinflated compatible with COPD.  Heart size is normal. 
 Enlargement of the hila bilaterally likely reflects pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Bullous changes with scarring is seen within the
 lung apices.  Linear opacities within the right mid lung field and left lung
 base also may reflect chronic changes.  Calcified granuloma in the right
 middle lobe is present.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is diffuse demineralization the osseous
 structures.
