                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and chest tightness.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A calcified granuloma in the right middle
 lobe is again seen.  Heart size is top-normal, unchanged.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal. Rightward tracheal deviation is due
 to left goiter. Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
