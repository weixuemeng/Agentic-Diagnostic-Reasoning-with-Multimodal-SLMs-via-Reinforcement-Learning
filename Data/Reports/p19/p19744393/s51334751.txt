                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Asthma, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Note is made of
 compression deformities of the lower thoracic vertebral bodies of
 indeterminate age and not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Compression deformities at the
 thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate age.  Correlate for site of point
 tenderness.  There may also be mild compression deformities along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine, again not well assessed.
