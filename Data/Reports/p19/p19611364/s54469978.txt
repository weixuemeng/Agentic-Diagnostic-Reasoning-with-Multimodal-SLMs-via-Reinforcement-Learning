                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy
 opacity within the left lung base with blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 appears chronic, and may reflect scarring with small left pleural effusion or
 pleural thickening.  There is streaky atelectasis in the right lung base. No
 focal consolidation, right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Clips from prior cholecystectomy are seen in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Mild degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous radiograph. Chronic left
 basilar scarring and blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus, possibly
 suggestive of a small left pleural effusion or pleural thickening. No focal
 consolidation.
