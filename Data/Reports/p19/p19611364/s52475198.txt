                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary infarction and effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again opacification at
 the left base with a small meniscus formation, consistent with residual
 pleural effusion.  The peripheral areas of opacification are essentially
 unchanged and may represent sequela of areas of infarction as on the prior CT
 scans.
