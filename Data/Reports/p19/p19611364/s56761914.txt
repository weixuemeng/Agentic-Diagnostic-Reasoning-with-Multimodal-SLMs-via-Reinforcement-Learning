                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 5 hours prior from___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded. A
 small left pleural effusion has increased over 5 hours. Associated peripheral
 opacities seen better on outside hospital CT are probably pulmonary
 infarctions.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Increasing small left pleural effusion with accompanying
 peripheral opacities which may reflect infarction in the setting of known
 pulmonary emboli.
