                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bruising and falls  // PNA? Rib Fracture?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chest:  The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Ribs:  No localizing history is available.  No marker is placed to indicate
 the site of focal symptoms.  No dedicated rib radiographs were included.  Of
 note, the lower most right ribs are not fully included on the available views.
 Allowing for this, the possibility of slight cortical offset involving the
 right eighth rib anteriorly cannot be excluded.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 No focal pneumonic infiltrate, pneumothorax or pleural effusion detected.
 
 Possible minimally displaced fracture of the right anterior eighth rib. 
 Clinical correlation for any focal site of symptoms is requested.  If there is
 ongoing concern for a a rib fracture, then dedicated rib radiographs could
 help for further assessment.
