 Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.

 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal and accentuated at due to
 low lung volumes.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There are
 minimal linear opacities within the lung bases compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
