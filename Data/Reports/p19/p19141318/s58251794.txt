                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HTN, hypothyroidism and newly diagnosed
 adenocarcinoma of the lung who presents for management of an enlarging
 pericardial effusion, orthopnea and dyspnea, concerning for impending cardiac
 tamponade physiology (septal flattening with rv invagination, tamponade
 physiology)  // Tamponade
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 19:14 there is more focal irregular
 consolidation at the right lung base.  However, the appearance is similar to
 ___ at 08:00 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is a right PICC line with tip overlying the distal most SVC. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Extensive increased
 interstitial markings in both lungs again noted.  Before, the right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Small right effusion
 would be difficult to exclude.  No gross left effusion.  Doubt CHF.  Presence
 or absence of pericardial effusion would be difficult to evaluate in this
 setting.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal irregular area of consolidation at the right lung base is more
 pronounced is in keeping with findings on the 07:55 ___
 radiograph, though more pronounced compared with the film from 19:14 ___.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
