                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx of endocarditis, IVDU  // Infiltrate,
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is linear atelectasis
 in the bilateral lung bases, new, but no definitive consolidation seen. 
 Potentially left lower lobe consolidation is a possibility.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Multiple old healed right rib fractures are
 again noted.  Lower thoracic compression deformities may be slightly worsened,
 however evaluation is slightly limited due to overlying atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New bibasilar areas of atelectasis, with potentially present left lower
 lobe consolidation.
 2. Lower thoracic compression deformities may be slightly worsened, however
 evaluation is slightly limited due to overlying atelectasis.  Dedicated
 thoracic spine radiographs could be performed if patient is symptomatic.
 3. Old rib fractures.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings and recommendation were emailed to the ED QA nurses.
