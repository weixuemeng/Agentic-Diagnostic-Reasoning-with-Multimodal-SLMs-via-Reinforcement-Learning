                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates linear opacity at the right lower
 lobe suggestive of atelectasis.  Lungs demonstrate no focal opacity convincing
 for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs
 are hyperexpanded suggestive of emphysematous changes.  Deformity of the
 eighth right rib posteriorly appears to be secondary to prior injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperexpanded lungs with flattening of the bilateral diaphragms suggestive of
 emphysema. No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.
