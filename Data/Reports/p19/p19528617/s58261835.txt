                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis, recent drug abuse and possible
 aspiration.  // Evaluate for pneumonia      Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 08:23 and a study
 dated ___ at 04:47.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are again visualized and
 although these findings could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia
 still should be considered in the correct clinical setting.  In addition, on
 the current study, there is a vague opacity in the left mid lung which could
 also represent an early infiltrate.  In addition, in the right mid lung
 overlying the right seventh posterior lateral rib, there is a suggestion of a
 faint 6-7 mm nodular opacity.  It is unclear whether this represents a
 pulmonary nodule or could represent confluence of bony structures.  Followup
 imaging with either plain film or chest CT should be considered. Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable. Old healed right-sided rib fracture. No acute
 bony abnormality appreciated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results of this examination were entered into the radiology
 critical results dashboard on ___ at 15:08.
