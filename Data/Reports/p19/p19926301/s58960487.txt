                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are markedly hyperinflated with significant elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm similar, with overlying atelectasis.  Streaky linear opacities
 in the mid and lower right lung are increased from the previous examination
 but their appearance is more suggestive of a chronic process.  There is mild
 blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle, which may be due to a
 small pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  Cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased mid and lower right lung streaky opacities are more suggestive of a
 chronic pulmonary process.  Comparison with any priors since ___ and
 continued follow-up.
  Mild blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle, small pleural
 effusion vs pleural thickening.
