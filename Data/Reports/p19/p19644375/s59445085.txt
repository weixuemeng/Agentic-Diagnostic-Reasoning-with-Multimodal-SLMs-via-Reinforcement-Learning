                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post right VATS, right lower lobe lobectomy, question
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show volume loss in the right
 hemithorax and some residual subcutaneous emphysema as well as what appears to
 be a sliver of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum on the lateral view.  This is
 decreased compared to yesterday's study.  Right upper lobe peripheral
 opacification is not increasing.  Blunted pleural angle at the operative site
 appears to be related to some residual fluid.  Moderately prominent ascending
 thoracic aorta is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Decrease in subcutaneous emphysema and streaky anterior
 mediastinal emphysema. Stable post-operative fluid and peripheral right upper
 lobe consolidation.
