 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with advanced NG  // eval NG placement      eval
 NG placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the nasogastric tube has
 been pushed forward, but is merely coiling in the fundus of the stomach. There
 is increased opacification at the right base medially. This is consistent with
 a dense streak of atelectasis as well as possible early consolidation. The
 left lung is essentially clear.
