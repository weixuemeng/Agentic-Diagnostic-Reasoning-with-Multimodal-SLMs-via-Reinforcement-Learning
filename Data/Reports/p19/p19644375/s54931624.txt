 There is a nasogastric tube whose side port is at the GE junction.  This could
 be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement.  There is a
 right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the distal SVC.  This appears to
 have been pulled back several centimeters since the prior study.  Endotracheal
 tube has been removed.  The mediastinum is prominent.  The heart size is
 within normal limits.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is a small right-sided
 pleural effusion, stable.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothoraces
 identified.
