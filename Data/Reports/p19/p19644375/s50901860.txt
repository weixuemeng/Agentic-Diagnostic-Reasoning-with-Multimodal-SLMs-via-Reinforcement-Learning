 HISTORY:  Aortic root replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the IJ sheath has been
 removed.  There are better lung volumes with no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid
 and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
