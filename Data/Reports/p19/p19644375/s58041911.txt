                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view. 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with type-B aortic dissection,
 pre-operative chest examination for surgery scheduled on ___.  Also,
 ascending aortic repair is planned.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  The heart size remains normal and no
 configurational abnormality is noted.  The entire thoracic aorta is generally
 widened and elongated, and this includes also the ascending portion to the
 right of the midline.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there
 are no signs of acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Also, the lateral
 pleural sinuses remain free from fluid accumulation and there is no
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Our records do not include a previous chest
 examination available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  General widening and elongation of thoracic aorta compatible with
 the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Prominence of ascending aorta is also
 noted.  There is no cardiac enlargement, no evidence of pulmonary congestion
 or pleural effusion on this preoperative single view chest examination.
