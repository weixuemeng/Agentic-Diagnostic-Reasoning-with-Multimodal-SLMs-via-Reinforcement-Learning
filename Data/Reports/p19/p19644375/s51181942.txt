                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post VATS, right lower lobe lobectomy with effusion, interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 13:57 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is some new confluent opacity in the right
 mid zone immediately above the right hemidiaphragm.  Based on the lateral
 view, this opacity could relate to pleural fluid along the anterior surface of
 the chest wall. The retrosternal air has decreased slightly.  There is a
 probable small right apical pneumothorax, as well as a small amount of
 residual retrosternal air.  A small right effusion is again noted. Right
 diaphragmatic elevation is unchanged. Streaky lucencies overlying the right
 lung likely represent subcutaneous emphysema in relation to the pectoralis
 muscle.  
 
 No upper zone re-distribution to suggest CHF.  No gross opacification of the
 right upper zone.  In the left lung, no CHF or focal consolidation.  Minimal
 left base atelectasis and minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible small apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  New hazy confluent opacity at the elevated right lung base, which may be
 due to fluid replacing a site or previously-seen retrosternal air.
 
 3.  New minimal atelectasis at the left base.  
 
 4.  No CHF.
