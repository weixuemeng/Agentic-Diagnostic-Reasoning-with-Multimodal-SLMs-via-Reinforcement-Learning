 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after right lower lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Residual left pneumothorax is tiny.  Unusual atelectasis defines a region of
 air-containing lung at the right lung base medially, simulating
 hydropneumothorax, but there is none.  There is a persistent small-to-moderate
 right pleural effusion.  The heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta tortuous
 and mildly enlarged but not focally dilated.
