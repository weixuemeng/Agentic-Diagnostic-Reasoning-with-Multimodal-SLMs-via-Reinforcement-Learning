                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Rapid atrial fibrillation, assessment for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in conjunction with
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum appear to be stable with tortuosity of the aorta,
 unchanged.  There is slight interval increase in right mid and upper lung
 opacity in conjunction with most likely loculated hydropneumothorax and
 subcutaneous air.  Minimal apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  No
 evidence of overt pulmonary edema is present.
