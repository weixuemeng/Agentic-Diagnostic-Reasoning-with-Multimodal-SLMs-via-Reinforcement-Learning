                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  VATS right lower lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___
 9:47 a.m.:
 
 Volume of the postoperative right lung has decreased substantially since
 ___.  Most of the change is due to progressive elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, and could be due to failure of the remaining right lung to fill
 the right pleural space, but raises concern for phrenic nerve palsy.  The
 small right hydropneumothorax is unchanged in size, fluid pooling inferiorly
 and anteriorly, air collected anteriorly and apically.  Right pleural ___
 drainage tube in place.
 
 Gaseous distention of the intestinal tract has increased, and should be
 followed.  Stomach is only moderately distended with air and fluid.  No
 nasogastric tube noted.
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  No left pleural effusion.  Thoracic aorta generally
 large but not focally dilated or acutely changed.
