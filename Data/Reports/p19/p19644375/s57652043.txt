                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with lung cancer after
 surgery.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The air-fluid level on the right is consistent with still present
 hydropneumothorax.  The amount of fluid is moderate.  Right chest tube is in
 place.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Lung volumes are
 relatively low as demonstrated on both PA and lateral views.
 
 Interval distention of the bowel is partially imaged and should be correlated
 with dedicated abdominal radiographs.
