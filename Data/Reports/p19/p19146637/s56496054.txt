                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:48 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with large subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right lung base is partially obscured, probably by small right pleural
 effusion, but the appearance still raises concern for several small regions of
 pneumonia.  When feasible, a lateral chest radiograph would be helpful to
 determine the contribution of each.  Thoracic aorta is very large generally
 and tortuous.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Mediastinal veins and pulmonary
 circulation in the right lung are engorged, indicating biventricular cardiac
 decompensation.  No pneumothorax.
