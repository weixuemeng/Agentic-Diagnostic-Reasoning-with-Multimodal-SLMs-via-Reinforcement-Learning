                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from approximately eight hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worst headache of life, subarachnoid hemorrhage, now with
 worsening shortness of breath, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was provided.  Patient
 is rotated and right CP angle is excluded.  There are vague opacities in the
 lower lungs which could represent aspiration.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 stable, though difficult to assess given patient rotation.  The bony
 structures appear intact with degenerative changes at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacities in the lower lungs are concerning for aspiration.
 Please note evaluation is markedly limited due to poor patient positioning.
