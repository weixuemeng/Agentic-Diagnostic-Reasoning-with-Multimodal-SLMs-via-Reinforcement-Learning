 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___, 4:04 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a nasogastric tube has been
 placed.  The tip of the tube is in the stomach.  Correct position of the
 endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter.  The right
 pleural effusion has minimally decreased but areas of right basal atelectasis
 persist.  Unchanged left basal atelectasis, the presence of a small left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
