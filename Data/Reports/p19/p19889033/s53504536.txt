                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and intubated at outside
 hospital.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON: CT Chest ___ performed after the radiograph.  The patient's
 true identity is not known at the time of dictation. 
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar opacities are
 atelectasis on subsequent chest CT.  Widening of the mediastinum is due to
 mediastinal lipomatosis on subsequent CT.  The nasogastric tube within the
 esophagus is displaced to the right, ending in the stomach, with the side port
 at the gastroesophageal junction.  There is no effusion or large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 side port is at the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced. Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
