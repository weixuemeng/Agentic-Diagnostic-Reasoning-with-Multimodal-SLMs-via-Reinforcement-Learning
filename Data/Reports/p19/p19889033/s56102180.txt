                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with
 bibasilar opacification consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 There probably is also some residual element of increased pulmonary venous
 pressure.
 
 The nasogastric tube has apparently been removed.
