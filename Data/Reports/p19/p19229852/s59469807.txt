                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p left ___ rib fracture ___, now with rib pain and chest
 pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal linear scarring in the lateral basal left lower lobe,
 near the left lateral costophrenic angle, is unchanged.  There are endplate
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  The ribs are not adequately
 penetrated, as expected on chest radiographs.  No displaced rib fracture or
 rib deformity from a prior fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for active cardiopulmonary disease.
