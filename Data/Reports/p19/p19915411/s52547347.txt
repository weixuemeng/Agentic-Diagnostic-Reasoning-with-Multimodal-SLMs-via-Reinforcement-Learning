                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Preeclampsia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within upper limits
 of normal in size.  There are bilateral substantial pleural effusions, more
 prominent on the left.  No definite pulmonary vascular congestion or acute
 focal pneumonia.  Compressive atelectasis is probably present at both bases.
