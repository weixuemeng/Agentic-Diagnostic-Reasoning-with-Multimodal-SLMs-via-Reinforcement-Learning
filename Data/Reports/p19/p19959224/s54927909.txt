                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, dyspnea, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema.  Relative sparing of the upper
 lungs suggests underlying emphysema.  No large effusion is seen.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Degenerative changes are notable at both shoulders. 
 Mottled appearance of the bone and the proximal humeri is of unclear etiology.
 Please correlate clinically.
