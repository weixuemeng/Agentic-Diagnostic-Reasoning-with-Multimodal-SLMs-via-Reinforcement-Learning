                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Stroke symptoms, assess for pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is an
 abnormal appearance of the right pulmonary hilum, which could reflect
 technique/rotation versus overlying soft tissue.  No abnormality is detected
 on the lateral projection.  No pneumothorax or effusion is seen.  Heart size
 cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Abnormal prominence of the right pulmonary hilum is likely
 technique due to rotation.  Consider repeat study to clarify.  Otherwise,
 unremarkable.
