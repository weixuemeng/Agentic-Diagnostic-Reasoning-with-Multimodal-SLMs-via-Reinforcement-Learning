                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates
 approximately 5.3 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip terminates below
 the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film.  The heart size is
 borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There are low
 lung volumes.  This results in crowding of the bronchovascular markings. 
 Patchy opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  A possible small left pleural effusion may be
 present.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube.
 2.  Low lung volumes, which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures.
 No overt pulmonary edema.
 3.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
