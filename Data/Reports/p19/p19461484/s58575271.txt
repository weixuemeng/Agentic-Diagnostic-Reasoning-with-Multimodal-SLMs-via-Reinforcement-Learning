 atelectasis/scarring is again seen. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 may be exaggerated by low lung volumes however, a degree of vascular
 congestion may be present. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
