                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS:

 consolidation is identified in the upper lungs.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evaluation of lung bases is limited due to overlying dense breast tissue.  No
 radiographic evidence of pneumonia is identified within this limitation. 
 Consider obtaining standard PA and lateral view radiographs for better
 evaluation of the lung bases.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider obtaining standard PA and lateral view
 radiographs for better evaluation of the lung bases.
