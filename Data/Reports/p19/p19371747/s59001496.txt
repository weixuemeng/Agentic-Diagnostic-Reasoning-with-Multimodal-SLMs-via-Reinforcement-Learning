                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aorta
 diffusely.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggests minimal pleural effusions
 bilaterally.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Mild to
 moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable minimal bilateral pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation.
