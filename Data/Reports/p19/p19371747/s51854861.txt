  Nasoenteric tube tip projects over the stomach.  Lung volumes are low
  accounting for enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is mild
  interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacity, most
  compatible with atelectasis.  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.5 cm
  above the carina.
