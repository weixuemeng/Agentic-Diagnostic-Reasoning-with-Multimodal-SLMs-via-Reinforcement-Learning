                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ coronary CTA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with bullous emphysematous disease,
 again most pronounced in the lung apices.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.   Prominent interstitial markings
 within the lung bases are similar compared to the prior study, and may reflect
 a chronic interstitial lung disease. There are mild degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Severe bullous emphysema.
