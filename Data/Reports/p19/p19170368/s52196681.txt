                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ hx of B/L PTXs s/p ?L pleurodesis in ___ in ___ now
 with spontaneous R PTX with complete collapse  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right-sided catheter is again seen, similar in position.
 
 There is been progressive re-expansion of the right lung, with decrease in
 size of the right apical pneumothorax and of the pneumothorax seen at the
 right lung base.  There is residual atelectasis at the right lung base, but
 this is also improved.  There does appear to be a small right effusion,
 similar prior, within associated hydro pneumothorax fluid level.
 
 The sizable bleb seen at the upper edge of the right lung on the prior study
 is not now visualized, but this may be due to changes in the configuration of
 the lung as it expands.
 
 Again seen are sutures at the left lung apex in this the patient with a known
 history or prior left-sided pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continuing re-expansion of the right lung, with interval decrease in size of
 the right apical and right base pneumothoraces and improvement in the right
 base atelectasis.  As before, there is actually a hydro pneumothorax at the
 right base, with a small right base pleural effusion.
