                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for lung process, patient with HCAP.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left mid and lower lung consolidation and right lower medial lung
 consolidations have minimally worsened over the last 24 hours.  Increased
 retrocardiac density is likely  due to a combination of consolidation and/or
 atelectasis and is unchanged.  Left pleural effusion is presumed to be small
 and stable.  Moderately enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left mid-lower lung and right lower medial lung consolidations
 have worsened over last 24 hours.  Retrocardiac increased density which is
 likely consolidation and/or atelectasis and presumed small left pleural
 effusion is similar.
