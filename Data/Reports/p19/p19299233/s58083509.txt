                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia on oxygen.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are reduced lung volumes which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is moderately enlarged.  Apparent mediastinal widening is
 also likely secondary to low lung volumes, and otherwise appears relatively
 unchanged compared to the prior exam.  There is mild pulmonary edema. 
 Additionally, more focal consolidative opacity in the retrocardiac region is
 concerning for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
