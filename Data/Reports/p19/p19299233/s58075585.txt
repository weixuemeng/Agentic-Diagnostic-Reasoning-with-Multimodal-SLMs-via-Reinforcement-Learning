                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There are perihilar opacities which may be due
 to mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities may relate to fluid overload;
 however, a superimposed infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion may be present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary
 edema, increased since the prior study.  Bibasilar opacities may relate to
 fluid overload, although superimposed infection is not excluded.  Possible
 very trace right pleural effusion.
