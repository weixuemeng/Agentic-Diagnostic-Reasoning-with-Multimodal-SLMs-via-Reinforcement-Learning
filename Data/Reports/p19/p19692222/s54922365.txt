                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter are unchanged in
 position.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion with associated peribronchial cuffing appears
 unchanged.  When compared to a similarly positioned radiograph of ___ at 4:50 a.m., there has been apparent increase in confluent opacity
 in the right infrahilar region.  This area is difficult to compare to the more
 recent radiograph of 12:50 p.m. on the same date, but may be improved since
 that time.  Differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema,
 aspiration, and less likely a focal infection.  Followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
