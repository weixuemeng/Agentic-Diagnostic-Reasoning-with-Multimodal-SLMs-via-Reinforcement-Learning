                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative for removal of infected VP shunt.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again bilateral
 lower lung opacifications worrisome for pneumonia in a patient with
 tracheostomy in place.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Some
 poor definition of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Probable small pleural effusions with mild basilar
 atelectasis.
