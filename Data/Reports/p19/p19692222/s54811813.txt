                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with VP shunt with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is new opacity at the right lung base
 suspicious for pneumonia.  Patchy opacity also identified at the left lung
 base, not significantly changed since ___.  Superiorly, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Tracheostomy tube
 is again seen.  Tubing from patient's known VP shunt is also seen along the
 right chest wall.  Incompletely visualized widening of the right
 acromioclavicular joint is seen.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right than on the left,
 compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Repeat exam with PA
 and lateral suggested after treatment to document resolution.
