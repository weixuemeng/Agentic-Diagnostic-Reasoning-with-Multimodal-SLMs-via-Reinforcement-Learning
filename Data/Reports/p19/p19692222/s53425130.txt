                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage status post trach
 and PEG.  Evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect view of the chest was obtained.  Apparent
 increase in right pleural effusion is likely due to patient rotation with
 respect to the film.  The top normal cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar
 to prior.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  A left approach central
 catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  A new tracheostomy terminates in proper
 position.  A new PEG overlies the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post tracheostomy and PEG placement, both of which appear
 in appropriate position.  Apparent increase in right pleural effusion is
 likely due to patient rotation with respect to the film.
