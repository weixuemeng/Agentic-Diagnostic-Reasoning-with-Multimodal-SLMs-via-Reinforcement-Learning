                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued prominence
 of the cardiac silhouette without definite pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is now increasing opacification at the right base with poor definition
 of the hemidiaphragm.  This suggests pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Less
 prominent opacification is seen at the left base.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 The monitoring and support devices remain in place.
