                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with only mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  This suggests cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in good position.  The
 hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, consistent with clearing of the previous
 pulmonary edema.  Mild atelectatic changes may be present.
