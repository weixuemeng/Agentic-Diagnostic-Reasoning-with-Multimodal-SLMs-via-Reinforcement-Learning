                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Chest CT is also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is again mildly tortuous. 
 There is patchy regional opacification of the right middle and lower lobes
 suggesting pneumonia with fluid along the major and minor fissures as well as
 a suspected small pleural effusion.  A small pleural effusion is also
 suspected on the left.  Hazy opacification and reticulation involving each mid
 lung zone may be associated with superimposed mild vascular congestion or
 fluid overload, but also could be secondary to widespread inflammatory
 process.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive new opacification, particularly in the right middle and
 lower lobes, most suggestive of pneumonia with pleural effusions, although
 reticulation in the mid lung zones may be due to coinciding fluid overload or
 sequelae of the inflammatory process.
