                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturations, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacity at the right
 lung base, potentially reflecting pneumonia, is slightly more dense than on
 the previous image.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus could indicate a
 coexisting small pleural effusion.
 
 No other parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
