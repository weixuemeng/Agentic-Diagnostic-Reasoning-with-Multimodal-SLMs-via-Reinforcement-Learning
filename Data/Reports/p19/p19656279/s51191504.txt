                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT trachea ___.  CT radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A retrocardiac opacity with slight leftward shift of the
 mediastinum is consistent with the patient's known chronic left lower lobe
 collapse.  Relative hyperlucency and mild hyperinflation is new in the right
 lung which may be secondary to new or worsened asthma and bronchospasm or from
 decreased perfusion, possibly due to a pulmonary embolism.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no new consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperlucency and mild hyperinflation on the right may represent acute
 bronchospasm or oligemia from pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Stable left lower lobe collapse.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:25 p.m. on ___ via
