                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 14:22 HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar to multiple prior exams, there is relative opacification of
 the left lower lobe which is partially atelectatic but also in part
 consolidation without volume loss resulting in the relatively bizarre
 morphology in the retrocardiac left lung.  No further consolidation is noted. 
 There is no superimposed edema.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
 Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent part atelectatic and part consolidative left lower
 lobe opacification.  Prior CT imaging on successive occasions has demonstrated
 extensive filling of the corresponding bronchioles with material.
