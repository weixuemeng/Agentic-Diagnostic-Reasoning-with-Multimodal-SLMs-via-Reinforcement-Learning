                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pseudomonal pneumonia in comatose patient with tracheostomy and
 quadriparesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued
 opacification of the lingula, superimposed on chronic left lower lobe
 collapse.  Heterogeneous left perihilar opacities are unchanged from ___,
 but slightly increased from ___.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is
 unchanged, as is mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.  Engorgement of the
 mediastinal vessels is also unchanged and suggestive of elevated central
 venous pressure.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left-sided pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  A left PICC has been advanced slightly, and now no longer
 abuts the lateral wall of the SVC, terminating in the mid portion of the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared to yesterday's study, there is overall interval
 stability of mild acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, right lower lobe
 atelectasis, and opacification of the lingula.  This may represent
 atelectasis, or given the patient's clinical history, consolidation from
 pneumonia.  This is stable from yesterday's study, but slightly increased
 since ___.
