                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fevers, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Opacification of left hemidiaphragm,
 downward displacement of the major fissure is compatible with patient's known
 chronic left lower lobe collapse.  No new focal consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Anterior
 cervical fusion hardware, a percutaneous gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy
 collar are noted. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
