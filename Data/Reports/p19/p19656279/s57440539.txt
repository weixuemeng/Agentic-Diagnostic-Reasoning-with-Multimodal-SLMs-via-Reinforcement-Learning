                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unresponsive patient with tracheotomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest re-demonstrates the patient's
 longstanding chronic left lower lobe collapse.  Between ___ and
 yesterday, a segment of aerated lung overlying the left heart border has
 become uniformly opacified.  This may be due to atelectasis of the lingula. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart is top normal in size and chronically
 leftward shifted.  Once again, the left PICC terminates within the right
 atrium and would need to be withdrawn 5.5 cm to ensure placement in the low
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lingular atelectasis superimposed on chronic left lower lobe
 collapse.  No evidence of acute cardiothoracic process.
 2.  The left PICC needs to be withdrawn 5.5 cm to ensure proper placement in
 the low SVC.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at 11:45 a.m.
