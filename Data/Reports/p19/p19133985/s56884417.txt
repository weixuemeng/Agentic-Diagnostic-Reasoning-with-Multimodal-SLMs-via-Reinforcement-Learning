                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post central line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semiupright view of the chest is provided.  Lung
 volumes are extremely low resulting in accentuation of pulmonary vasculature. 
 Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect atelectasis.  Heart is normal
 in size and cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is no large
 effusion.  A right-sided internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the
 right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.
 2.  Extremely low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular crowding and left
 basilar atelectasis.
