                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea  // pulmonary edema, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison ___ study the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Left retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Previously seen right basilar
 opacity likely represents vascular crowding secondary to low lung volume
 though superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The upper lungs are clear.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are
 seen.  Again seen is a right PICC line with the catheter tip terminating at
 the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable left retrocardiac atelectasis and no evidence of pulmonary edema.  A
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded, in the right clinical setting,
 given the above findings.
