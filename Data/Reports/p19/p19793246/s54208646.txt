                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough for 2 weeks
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar, with unchanged prominence of the right hilum. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Linear opacities in both lung bases are compatible with
 areas of subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. Remote right-sided rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
