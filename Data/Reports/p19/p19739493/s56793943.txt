                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple GSW  // interval cxr, evaluate for
 pneumo/hemothorax      interval cxr, evaluate for pneumo/hemothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again increased
 opacification involving substantial amount of the left lower lung consistent
 with some combination of volume loss and pulmonary contusion with shift of the
 mediastinum to this side.  There is a small pneumothorax on the left with
 chest tube in place.
 Little change in the hyperexpansion it right hemithorax.  However, there is
 increasing prominence of the superior mediastinum on this side with
 displacement of the trachea to the left.  This is worrisome for increasing
 hemorrhage in an area where there had been some hemorrhage on previous CT
 scan.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  This information was directly communicated to the resident
 taking care the patient (___) at 8:18 AM on ___, immediately upon
 discovery.
