                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:15 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute respiratory distress.  Assess fluid
 status.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lungs were clear on ___, heart size normal, with no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation.  Lung volumes are lower since, with changes in both lower
 lobes that could be atelectasis alone or in combination with aspiration. 
 There is also a new small right subpulmonic pleural effusion and pulmonary
 vascular congestion, but there is insufficient edema to explain respiratory
 insufficiency.  Heart size remains normal.
