                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and shortness of breath.  Dehydrated when
 the previous chest x-ray was taken, is there now pneumonia visible with
 rehydration?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small left pleural effusion is new.  There is definitely new peribronchial
 opacification in the left lower lobe, but whether it is atelectasis or small
 region of pneumonia, I cannot say.  The right lung is perfectly clear.  Heart
 is normal size.  The caliber of the pulmonary vasculature on ___ does
 not suggest dehydration; in fact, the vascular caliber today is more sparse.
