 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for patient
 rotation.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are present, most likely
 represent atelectasis.  Other superimposed process such as aspiration or early
 infectious pneumonia are less likely, but followup radiographs may be helpful
 in this regard.
