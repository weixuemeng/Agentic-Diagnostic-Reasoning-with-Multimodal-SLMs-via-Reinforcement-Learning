                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Pain, left fifth and sixth anterior ribs after fall.  Evaluate
 possible rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, but clear of focal abnormality.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart is normal, though slightly larger
 today than in ___.  There is slight undulation to the left anterolateral
 seventh rib, which could be an acute fracture, but is not definitive.  I would
 mark areas of point tenderness and request rib detail views of those regions.
