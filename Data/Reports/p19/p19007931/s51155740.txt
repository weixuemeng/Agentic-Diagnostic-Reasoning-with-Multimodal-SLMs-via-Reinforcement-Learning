 pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  This obscures the left heart border, but allowing for this the
 heart is likely normal in size.  There is no focal consolidation.  At the left
 lung base is atelectasis, likely a small amount of pleural fluid.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with atelectasis and possible small
 pleural effusion.  No definite focal consolidation.
