                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT imaging was recently performed on ___.  Prior
 chest radiograph is available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right-sided pleural effusion which is difficult to
 directly compare to the prior PET-CT, but probably similar in size.  A
 suspicious nodule projects over the right upper lobe, measuring 9 mm in
 diameter.  There is only slight leftward shift of mediastinal structures so
 areas of atelectasis in the right lung coinciding with an effusion,
 particularly involving the right lower lobe, are suspected.  The left lung
 remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The bones are probably demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right-sided pleural effusion.  Suspicious nodule projecting
 over the right upper lobe.
