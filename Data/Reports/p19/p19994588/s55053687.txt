                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Check for worsening pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there may be some further
 increase in the right pleural effusion, though this could reflect differences
 in patient position.  Mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels on the
 right suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.
 
 The questioned nodule projecting over the right upper zone is again seen.  It
 remains in conjunction with the second rib.
