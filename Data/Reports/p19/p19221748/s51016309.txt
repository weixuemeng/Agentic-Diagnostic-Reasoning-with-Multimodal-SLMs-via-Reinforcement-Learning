                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right pigtail catheter placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.  Chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Although a right pleural pigtail drainage catheter has not changed
 position, since ___ a moderate volume of pleural fluid has
 reaccumulated, extending up the lateral costal surface and into the fissure.
 There is no pneumothorax. The consolidation in the right lower lobe is
 probably atelectasis given the history of longstanding effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, but stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion reaccumulated over one day.
 2.  Recurrent right lower lobe atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
