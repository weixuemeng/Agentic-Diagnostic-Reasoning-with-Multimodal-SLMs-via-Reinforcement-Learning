                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Large right pleural effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly more
 aeration at the right base on the frontal view than on the previous study. 
 The pleural drain remains in place.
 
 However, on the lateral view, there is increased opacification more
 posteriorly, with a configuration suggesting a loculated pleural mass.  CT
 could be helpful in further clarifying the appearance.
 
 The upper zones are clear, and there is no evidence of pneumonia in the left
 lung.
