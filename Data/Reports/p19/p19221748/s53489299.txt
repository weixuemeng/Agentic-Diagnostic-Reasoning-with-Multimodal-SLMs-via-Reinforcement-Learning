                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right diaphragmatic hernia repair with chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in the appearance of post-operative changes in the right upper abdomen
 with decreased volume of the right lung.  Low lung volumes may account for
 much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Mild
 atelectatic or fibrotic streaks are seen.  No acute focal pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.
