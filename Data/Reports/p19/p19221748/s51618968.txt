 Small right pleural effusion has minimally decreased.  There is more air in
 the right pleural space.  Right lower lobe and right middle lobe opacities
 have improved.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The left lung is
 grossly clear.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Right basal chest tubes and
