                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of right-sided chest tube, there is no visible
 pneumothorax.  Linear opacity adjacent to the chest tube site probably
 represents the tract of the prior tube.  Multifocal patchy and linear
 atelectasis have slightly improved in the interval, and a small right pleural
 effusion adjacent to an elevated right hemidiaphragm appears unchanged. 
 Remainder of the exam is unchanged since the recent study.
