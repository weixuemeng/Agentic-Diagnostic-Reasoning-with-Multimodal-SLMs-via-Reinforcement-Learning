                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old status post right hepatic lobectomy,
 ___, returning with fever, nausea, vomiting, and large right pleural
 effusion status post VATS with decortication compared to previous chest film.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___ hours.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ hours are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line with the tip in the mid SVC.  Right basilar
 chest tubes in place.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with adjacent patchy opacity which likely represents
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No evidence of left pleural
 effusion.  Interval removal of one of the right chest tubes.  There is now a
 curvilinear line parallel to the thoracic cage towards the apex.  This most
 likely represents  residual track of the chest tube, although a pneumothorax
 cannot be entirely excluded and therefore followup imaging would be advised. 
 The left lung is well inflated and grossly clear.
