 calcifications within the medial aspect of the left upper lung field are
 unchanged compatible prior granulomatous disease.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency in the lung
 apices compatible with underlying emphysema.  Previously noted right lower

 pneumothorax is identified.  Scattered calcified granulomas are also noted
 within the lungs.  Partial resection of the ___ right posterior rib is again
 noted.  There are no acute osseous findings.
