 HISTORY:  Evaluation for an infectious process in patient with persistent
 cough and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to the previous
 examination.  There is new opacity in the right lower lobe.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.  Hyperinflation and a calcific densities
 projecting over the medial left clavicle are unchanged.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity is compatible with pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.  Recommend follow-up after treatment to document
 resolution.
