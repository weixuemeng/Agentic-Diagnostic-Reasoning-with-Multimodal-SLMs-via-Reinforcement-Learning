                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with COPD and hospitalization in ___ for
 pneumonia.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms and the parenchymal pattern consistent with severe COPD.  No
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is present.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 demonstrates prominence of the right upper mediastinal contour, which should
 be further evaluated with shallow oblique images.  Partial resection of the
 posterior right fifth rib is also stable.  Bilateral nipple shadows should not
 be confused for pulmonary nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Prominence of the right upper
 mediastinal contour should be further evaluated with shallow oblique images.
