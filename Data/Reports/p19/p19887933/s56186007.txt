 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis and ascites, evaluation for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a left pleural effusion, with subsequent increase in radiodensity.  The
 extent and location of the effusion is better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph.  No other parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged lower
 lung volumes and unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
