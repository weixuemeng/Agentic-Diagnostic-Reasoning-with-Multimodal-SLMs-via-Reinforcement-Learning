                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF, worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view was suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Given this, there may
 be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal vascular congestion without overt pulmonary
 edema.
