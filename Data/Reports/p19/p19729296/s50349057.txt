                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain, left rib
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Slight
 increase in opacity in the left mid to lower lung is felt to most likely be
 due to overlying soft tissues and it is not substantiated on the lateral view.
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.  However, if clinical concern for rib fracture,
 suggest dedicated rib series.
