                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with pleuritic left-sided chest pain after
 six-hour flight, recent colon cancer diagnosis, concern for pulmonary
 embolism.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Hilar contours are also within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
