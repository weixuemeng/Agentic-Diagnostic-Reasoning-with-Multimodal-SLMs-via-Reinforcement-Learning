                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and left lower lobe crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS: CT torso examination dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a metallic stent graft along the descending aorta and
 prior sternotomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is similar moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  A
 mild interstitial abnormality and cephalization of pulmonary vascularity
 suggests slight congestion, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post stent graft placement and sternotomy.  Findings
 suggesting mild vascular congestion.
