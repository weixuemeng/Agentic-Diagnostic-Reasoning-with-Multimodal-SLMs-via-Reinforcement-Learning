                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent stroke. Now with rising leukocytosis. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, there is increasing opacification of the bilateral bases
 which is likely atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia. New bibasilar opacities are likely
 atelectasis.  Recommend a repeat chest radiograph later today or tomorrow to
 ensure the opacities are not increasing.
