                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, leg pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Asymmetric opacity within the
 medial aspect of the right lung is noted, and it is unclear if this reflects
 overlapping shadows versus a true pulmonary lesion.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Asymmetric opacity within the right lung apex.  Apical lordotic views are
 recommended to assess whether this reflects a true pulmonary lesion.
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise detected.
