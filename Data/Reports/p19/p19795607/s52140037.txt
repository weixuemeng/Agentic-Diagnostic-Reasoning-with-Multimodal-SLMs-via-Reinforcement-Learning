                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left rib pain status post mechanical fall, here to evaluate for
 rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased streaky opacification at the right lung base
 greater than the left lung base most compatible with atelectasis.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are slightly prominent
 due to unfolding of the thoracic aorta but otherwise within normal limits. 
 The hilar contours are unremarkable.  The trachea is midline.  There is no
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  No displaced rib fractures are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis on the right greater than the left.  No
 displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.
