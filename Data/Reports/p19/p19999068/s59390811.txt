                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient intubated with NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Right lower lobe opacity and minimal
 left basal opacities appear unchanged, as previously mentioned potentially
 demonstrating atelectasis versus infectious process.  Given the unchanged
 appearance of those abnormalities, aspiration is less likely.
