                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with alcohol withdrawal, concerns and
 aspiration risk, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next previous similar
 study of ___.  On previous examination identified right lower
 parenchymal density partially overshadowed by the heart contours and
 apparently located in the right lower lobe posterior segment has cleared up. 
 No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified and no pulmonary vascular
 congestion is found.  Similar as on the preceding examination of ___,
 there is a rounded mass overlying the contour of the ascending arch.  This
 abnormality has not changed significantly since yesterday.  Comparison with a
 supine chest examination transferred from ___, this mass is
 new.  Unfortunately, the transferred image is not identified by date.
 
 This surprising finding is noted and transmitted by page to referring
 physician, ___. ___.  During the subsequent discussion performance of a
 chest CT was recommended as the finding most likely represents an acute
 uncommon aortic dissection.
