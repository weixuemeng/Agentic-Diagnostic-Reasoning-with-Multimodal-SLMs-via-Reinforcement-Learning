                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, one week status post bowel
 obstruction and recent bowel surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  The lungs are clear of consolidation or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Tortuous aorta is
 noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  There is
 increased lucency at the right lung base, likely below the hemidiaphragm
 suspicious for intraperitoneal air.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased lucency at the right lung base thought most likely to
 be below the hemidiaphragm suspicious for free intraperitoneal air,
 potentially from recent surgery; however, amount of air is more than expected
 given time since surgery.   
 
 Findings discussed with ___ resident at 1:40 pm at time of discovery.
