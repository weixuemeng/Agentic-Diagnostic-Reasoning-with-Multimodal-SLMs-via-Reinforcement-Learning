 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates mild cardiomegaly,
 pulmonary vascular congestion, and interstitial edema.  However, the right
 upper lobe is disproportionately consolidated suggestive of pneumonia. There
 was a smaller consolidation in the same lobe in ___, so either the
 pneumonia is recurrent or the abnormality is the 'pneumonia' form of
 bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer.  Another alterhative is asymmetric  edema
 if patient has marked mitral regurgitation. Probable small left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Moderate hiatus hernia is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Probable right upper lobe pneumonia, alternatively asymmetric edema if
 patient has marked mitral regurgitation, or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma
 progressed sinde ___.
