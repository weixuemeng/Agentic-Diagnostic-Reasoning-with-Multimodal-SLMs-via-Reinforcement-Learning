                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with CHF and respiratory distress.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Heterogeneous opacification of
 the right lung is increased with increased involvement of the right lower
 lung.  Right upper lobe involvement appears stable.  Pulmonary edema is
 slightly improved.  Left pleural effusion has decreased in size.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Moderate hiatal hernia is
 chronic.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased heterogeneous opacity of the right lower lung with unchanged
 involvement of the right upper lung likely reflects worsening infection or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 2.  Improved pulmonary edema with decreased size of left pleural effusion.
