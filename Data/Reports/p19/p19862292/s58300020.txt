                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Hazy ill-defined
 opacity is noted within the left mid lateral lung field. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left are demonstrated. Streaky linear
 opacities within the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis. There is no
 pneumothorax. Right type 3 AC joint separation history is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Hazy ill-defined opacity in the left mid lateral lung field. This may
 reflect pneumonia, and followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to
 ensure resolution of this finding.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Right basilar atelectasis.
