                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low
 limiting evaluation.  There is subtle lower lung opacity which is most
 compatible with atelectasis though difficult to exclude a very early
 pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of congestion or
 edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasal opacities in the setting of low lung lung volumes likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude an early pneumonia.
