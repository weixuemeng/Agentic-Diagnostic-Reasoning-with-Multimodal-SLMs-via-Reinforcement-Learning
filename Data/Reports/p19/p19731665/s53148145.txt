                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with female new oxygen requirement and recent
 discharge from outside hospital for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable frontal AP chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral
 diffuse ground glass and reticular opacities. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart is top normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contour is
 unremarkable.  Visualized osseous structures are without acute abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral reticular and groundglass opacities for which
 the differential is broad. Given patient history, hypersentivity pneumonitis
 should be considered. Clinical correlation is recommended.
