                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis presenting with fever,
 cough, dypsnea // Please assess for infiltrate, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Coarse bilateral reticular opacities are in keeping with the known history of
 fibrosis. As compared to the prior chest radiograph from ___, new
 superimposed interstitial opacities suggest an acute process such as infection
 or pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New diffuse interstitial opacities superimposed on chronic fibrosis may be due
 to exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, infection or edema.  A dedicated
 chest CT may be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
