                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously reported small nodular opacity adjacent to the right
 second anterior rib is no longer visualized.  Lungs remain markedly
 hyperexpanded, in keeping with emphysema, but there are no focal areas of
 consolidation or substantial atelectasis present.  Heart size, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits and without change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of small right upper lobe nodular opacity, which was likely
 infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs, likely due to severe emphysema.
