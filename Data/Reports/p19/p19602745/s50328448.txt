                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with tachycardia, fever, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The patient has hyperinflated lungs.  There is new bilateral lower lobe
 bronchial wall thickening consistent with bronchial infection.  Subtle right
 upper lobe subcentimeter nodular opacity adjacent to ___ anterior rib is new. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New bronchial wall thickening mostly in the lower lobes is concerning for
 acute bronchitis.
 
 2.  New right upper lobe small nodular opacity is likely infectious or
 inflammatory, but a follow up standard PA and lateral chest x-ray before
 discharge is suggested.
