                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with an upper GI bleed and recent intubation.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph, supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left PICC tip persists at the lower SVC.  There has been
 interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter whose tip
 terminates at the upper SVC.  There has been interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube that sits 6 cm above the carina.  No endogastric tube is
 seen projecting over the stomach and it is not definitively seen coursing
 along the central chest.
 
 Otherwise, the heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 The lungs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis.  A left pleural effusion is
 present, the extent of which is difficult to approximate on a supine exam. 
 Assessment for pneumothorax is limited by positioning as well.  The visualized
 portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates a stent in the right upper quadrant
 as well as embolization coil material and clips.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes as described above; advancement of the
 endotracheal and endogastric tubes is advised with followup radiograph. 
 Findings were discussed with the ordering team at 4 p.m. on ___ by ___
 ___ over the phone.
