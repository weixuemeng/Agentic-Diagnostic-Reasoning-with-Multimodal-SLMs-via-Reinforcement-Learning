                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary edema.  The possibility
 of supervening pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical
 setting, and a lateral view would be helpful if the condition of the patient
 would permit.  
 
 Port-A-Cath remains in place.
