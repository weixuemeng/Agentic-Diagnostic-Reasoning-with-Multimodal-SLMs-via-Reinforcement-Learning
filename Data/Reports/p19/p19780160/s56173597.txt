                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ampullary cancer status post ERCP with bacteremia, now hypotension,
 rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs dated ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE AP VIEW.  
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  Heart size is borderline
 enlarged, with a left ventricular configuration.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density and blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small effusion. 
 Allowing for technique, I doubt CHF.  The right lung is grossly clear, without
 focal infiltrate or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with small
 left effusion which, if real, would be new compared with ___.  If
 clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for further assessment.
