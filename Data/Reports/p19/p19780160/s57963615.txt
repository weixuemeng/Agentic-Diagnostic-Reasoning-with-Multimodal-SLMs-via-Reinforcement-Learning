                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post Whipple, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE VIEW.
 
 Supine positioning.  There is underpenetration of much of the mediastinum,
 particularly the lower mediastinum.  As a result, the lower portion of the NG
 tube is not well delineated.  A right IJ central line is present, unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  Additional linear density/device
 overlies the left chest.  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, though
 this may be accentuated by supine technique.  There is patchy opacity at both
 lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for considerable technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.
