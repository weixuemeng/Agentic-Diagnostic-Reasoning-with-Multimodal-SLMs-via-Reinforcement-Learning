                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are very low in
 comparison to the ___ examination, resulting in bronchovascular
 crowding.  Bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible with atelectasis.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath remains unchanged in position, terminating at the
 upper right atrium.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart
 size is top normal, and the hilar and mediastinal contours remain within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: Very low lung volumes resulting in the bibasilar linear opacities,
 likely atelectasis. A repeat chest radiograph with greater inspiratory effort
 could be obtained if there remains high clinical concern for basilar
 consolidation.
