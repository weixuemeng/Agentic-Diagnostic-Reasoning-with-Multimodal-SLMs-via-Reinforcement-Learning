                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cold-like symptoms, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been increased
 opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
 Although this could merely reflect atelectasis and effusion, in view of the
 clinical history, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  This information has been telephoned to Dr. ___ at 9:30 a.m. on
 ___.
 
 There is also mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No evidence of
 vascular congestion.
