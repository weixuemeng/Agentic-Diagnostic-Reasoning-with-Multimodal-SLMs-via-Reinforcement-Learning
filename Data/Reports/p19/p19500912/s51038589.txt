                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pregnant with tachycardia, to assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are very low lung volumes with
 prominence of pulmonary vasculature that most likely represents the high-flow
 state of pregnancy.  No evidence of pneumothorax or acute focal pneumonia.
