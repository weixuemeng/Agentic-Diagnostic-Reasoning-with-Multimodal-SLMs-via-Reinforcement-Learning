 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a right upper lobe paramediastinal mass.  Surrounding this mass is an area
 of parenchymal opacity that is, however, less extensive than on the previous
 image.  No new parenchymal opacity.  Old right healed rib fracture. 
 Unremarkable left lung.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No evidence of pleural effusions.
