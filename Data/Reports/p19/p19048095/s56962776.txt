                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Prominence of interstitial markings is seen in
 the right perihilar region, similar to prior, most likely relates to
 underlying pulmonary emphysema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  Hilar contours are also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
