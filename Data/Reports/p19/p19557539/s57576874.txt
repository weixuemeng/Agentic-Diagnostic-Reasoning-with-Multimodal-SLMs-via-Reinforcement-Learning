                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable of the chest.
 
 Comparison was made with prior chest radiograph through ___, to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.4 cm above the carina and is
 adequately positioned.  Orogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach;
 however, the distal end is off radiographic view.  Since ___,
 right lower lung opacities have increased and is concerning for
 aspiration/pneumonia.  Increased retrocardiac density suggestive of lower lung
 atelectasis and presumed small bilateral pleural effusions is similar. 
 Left-sided internal jugular line ends at upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right lower lung opacities since ___ is concerning for
 aspiration/pneumonia. Clinical correlation is required
 
 2.  Left lower lung atelectasis and presumed small bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged since ___.
