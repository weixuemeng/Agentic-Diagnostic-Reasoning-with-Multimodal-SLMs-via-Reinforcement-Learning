                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypertension and diabetes, status post
 cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for infection or edema.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter tip projects within
 the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip 4.4 cm
 above the carina.  An enteric feeding tube courses below the diaphragm out of
 field of view.  Since the prior examination, there has been improvement in
 parenchymal opacification, likely related to edema/atelectasis.  There are no
 new focal occurring parenchymal opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not increased.
 
 Since the prior examination, there are areas of hyperlucency demonstrated
 along the left lateral aspect of the mediastinum projecting over the mid
 aspect of the mediastinum and adjacent to the left main stem bronchus, for
 which the possibility of pneumomediastinum cannot be excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable.  There is mild
 tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple areas of hyperlucency as detailed above projecting in
 the region of the mediastinum which raises the possibility of
 pneumomediastinum, for which patient must undergo chest CT for further
 evaluation.
