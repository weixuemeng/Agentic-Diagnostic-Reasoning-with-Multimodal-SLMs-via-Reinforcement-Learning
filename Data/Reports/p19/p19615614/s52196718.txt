                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The lung volumes are low, and in that context, streaky
 basilar opacities, left greater than right, suggest minor atelectasis.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
