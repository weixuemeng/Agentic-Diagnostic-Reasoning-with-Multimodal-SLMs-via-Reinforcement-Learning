                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fevers, question cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show a subtle right lower lobe opacity.  This
 is associated with widening of the right paratracheal stripe and prominence of
 the right tracheobronchial angle.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 mediastinal silhouette is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe opacity with associated paratracheal adenopathy warrants
 further examination with a chest CT.
