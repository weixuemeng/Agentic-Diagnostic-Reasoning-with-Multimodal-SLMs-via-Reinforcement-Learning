                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A subtle medial right basilar opacity is seen which may be due to
 atelectasis, although an infectious process is not excluded.  Left lung is
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle medial right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis and
 overlap of vascular structures, although an early infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting, however, felt less likely.
