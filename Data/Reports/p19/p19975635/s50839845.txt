                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative rib fractures, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes with atelectatic changes at the
 left base and blunting of the costophrenic angle persists.  No vascular
 congestion.
