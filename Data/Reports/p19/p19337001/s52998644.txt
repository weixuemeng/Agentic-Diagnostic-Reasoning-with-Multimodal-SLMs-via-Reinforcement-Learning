                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Stage IV lung cancer with new hydropneumothorax, in
 followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___ and chest ___,
 ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as before.  Cardiac size
 cannot be evaluated.  A small left apical hydropneumothorax is probably
 unchanged from prior study, CT, ___, allowing the difference in
 technique.  Opacity in the left lower hemithorax is a combination of lung
 collapse, pleural effusion, and lung cancer.
 
 The right lung is grossly clear.  The patient has known sclerotic lesions in
 thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.
