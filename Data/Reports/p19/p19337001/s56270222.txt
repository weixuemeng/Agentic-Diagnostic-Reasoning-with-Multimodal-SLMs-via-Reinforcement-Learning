                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; a CT Torso study is also
 available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased opacification of the left hemithorax.  As seen
 previously, the left mid-to-lower hemithorax shows complete opacification with
 a large pleural effusion and net volume loss including leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  What is new
 on this examination is predominantly increased vague opacification of the
 residual aerated portion of the left upper lung.  Since pulmonary markings can
 still be discerned through the veil-like opacity, the appearance is suspected
 predominantly reflect increasing pleural effusion along the major fissure,
 although it is difficult to completely exclude increasing atelectasis or
 consolidation.  The right lung remains clear with compensatory hyperinflation.
 Bony metastases are not well visualized on this study for the most part,
 although a mid thoracic vertebral body appears largely sclerotic and
 potentially the degree of sclerosis has increased since the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increasing opacification of the left upper hemithorax, suspected to
 predominantly represent increasing pleural effusion, without other significant
 change in pulmonary findings.  
 
 2.  Sclerotic mid thoracic vertebral body; although noting that metastases to
 the bones are mostly not well characterized, the possibility of increased bony
 metastatic disease since the prior CT should be considered.
