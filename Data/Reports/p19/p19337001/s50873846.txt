                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with left "lung" pain and history of
 cancer, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As seen previously, there is complete opacification of the left
 lower lung.  The left upper lung remains aerated.  There is a stable left
 apical cap which represents loculated pleural fluid as seen on prior CT.   
 The right lung is slightly hyperexpanded.  A nodular opacity projecting over
 the right lower lung measures 11 mm and likely represents a nipple shadow.  If
 there is clinical concern for mass, a repeat view should be obtained with
 nipple markers.  Sclerotic bone lesions are better appreciated on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable left lower lung opacification, with loculated left pleural
 effusion.   
 2.  Nodular opacity overlying the right lower lung likely represents a nipple
 shadow, however if confirmation of this is needed, repeat views can be
 obtained with a nipple marker.
