                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso examination from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: Allowing for differences in technique, comparing with the prior
 scout view, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  Bones appear demineralized with mild-to-moderate
 degenerative changes and rightward convex curvature centered along the mid
 thoracic spine.  Along the left upper lateral chest there are irregularities
 involving the lateral aspect of the descending upper left ribs concerning for
 one or more rib fractures, possibly involving the second through fourth ribs,
 although acuity is uncertain since old rib fractures were present on the left
 before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected left upper lateral rib fractures, incompletely
 characterized and of uncertain acuity.  Characterization with dedicated rib
 films or CT could be considered if more detailed assessment is needed
 clinically.  Although old rib fractures were seen on the prior CT, these
 appear irregular and are not necessarily old based on the imaging findings. 
 Correlation with physical findings is recommended.
