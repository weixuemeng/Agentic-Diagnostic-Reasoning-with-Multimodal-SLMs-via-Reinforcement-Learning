 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Previously demonstrated patchy opacity
 within the left lower lobe persists, but appears slightly improved compared to
 the prior exam.  The right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved aeration within the left lower lobe with residual patchy opacity
 likely reflecting improving pneumonia.
