                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with small bowel obstruction with possible internal
 hernia, for preop evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increased opacification of the left
 mid lung field compared to the most recent prior examination, which may
 represent atelectasis; however, infectious etiology cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There is unchanged cardiomegaly. 
 Atelectasis within the right lung base has resolved.
