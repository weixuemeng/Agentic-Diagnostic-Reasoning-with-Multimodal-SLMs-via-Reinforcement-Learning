                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about
 7.5 cm above the carina.  For more optimal positioning could be advanced by 3
 to 4 cm.  An orogastric tube was also placed, which terminates in the gastric
 cardia but with little purchase.  The tube could probably be advanced by about
 8 to 10 cm if gastric positioning is desired.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a patchy bronchovascular type of opacification pattern
 in the right infrahilar region.  Possibilities include airway inflammation,
 infection or possibly aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation and placement of orogastric tube. 
 Advancing each is suggested for more optimal positioning if clinically
 indicated.
 
 2.  A right infrahilar bronchovascular opacification.  Re-assessment with
 short-term follow-up radiographs is suggested.  Possibilities include airway
 inflammation or infection, versus possibly a small region of aspiration
 pneumonitis.
