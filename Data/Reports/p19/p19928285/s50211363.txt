                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post liver biopsy with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, Ct abdomen ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear
 with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are identified. 
 No free air is noted under the hemidiaphragms.  A tube is visualized overlying
 the sternum in the lateral projection, is likely external to the patient, but
 clinical correlation is recommended. Nodular opacity over left lung base is
 likely nipple as this area of lung is clear on CT performed the same day. 
 Calcific densities are again noted in the region of the pancreatic tail and
 consistent with patient's history of chronic pancreatitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
