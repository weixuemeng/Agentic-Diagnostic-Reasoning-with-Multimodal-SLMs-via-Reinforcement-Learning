                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.  Evaluate for free intraperitoneal air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  This causes accentuation of the cardiac silhouette
 size which is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is slightly widened
 superiorly and this is likely due to low lung volumes.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen though there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result of
 low lung volumes.  Hilar contours are normal.  Minimal streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.  No free air is
 noted under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
