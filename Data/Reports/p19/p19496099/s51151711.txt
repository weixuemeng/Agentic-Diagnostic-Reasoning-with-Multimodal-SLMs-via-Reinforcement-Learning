                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypertensive urgency with question of acute pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  A subtle vague
 opacity in the left lower lung is seen adjacent to the left heart border which
 could represent tiny focus of pneumonia, though due to low lung volumes,
 evaluation is somewhat limited.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No signs of
 pulmonary edema or effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left lung base adjacent to the left heart
 border, question early pneumonia.  Consider repeat radiographs with dedicated
 PA and lateral views with more optimized inspiratory effort to better assess.
