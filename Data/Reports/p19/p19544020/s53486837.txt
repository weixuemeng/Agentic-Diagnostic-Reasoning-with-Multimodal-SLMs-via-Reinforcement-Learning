                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with CP  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  There is left basilar opacity silhouetting
 the hemidiaphragm, similar to prior.  There is likely component of effusion
 although underlying consolidation is also possible.  New right basilar opacity
 is also noted, some of which may be due to atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angle suggests bilateral effusions.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion appears to have progressed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities left worse than right have progressed since prior likely
 in part due to underlying effusions with superimposed atelectasis noting that
 infection would also be possible.  Interval worsening of the pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
