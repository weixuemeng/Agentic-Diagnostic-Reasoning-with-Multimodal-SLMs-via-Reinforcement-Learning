                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:09
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with long smoking history, admitted for
 pneumonia, found to have lung mass concerning for malignancy, now with
 post-obstructive process, improving respiratory status.
 
 Comparison is made to portable study of ___ at 18:26.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 14:09 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval overall decrease in lung volumes with persistent patchy opacity
 in the left mid and lower lung as well as at the right lung base.  Some of
 this likely reflects patchy atelectasis, particularly at the right base, but
 the left-sided airspace abnormality is essentially unchanged and may represent
 postobstructive pneumonia.  The left hilum remains prominent, raising concern
 for lymphadenopathy.  No pulmonary edema.  Layering left effusion and no large
 right effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, heart size is stable given
 differences in patient positioning.
