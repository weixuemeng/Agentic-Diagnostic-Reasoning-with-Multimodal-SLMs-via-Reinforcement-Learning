  Lucency underlying the left hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum or
  the stomach.  Correlation with left lateral decubitus radiographs of the
  abdomen would be useful to confirm the presence of free air.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ABD pain, peritoneal signs, recurrent SBO, evaluate for
 pneumoperitoneum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lucency underlying the left hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum or
 the stomach bubble.  Correlation with left lateral decubitus views of the
 abdomen could be useful in differentiating between these 2 entities.  Low lung
 volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental atelectasis.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Moderate
 acromioclavicular degenerative changes are noted bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lucency underlying the left hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum or
 the stomach.  Correlation with left lateral decubitus radiographs of the
 abdomen would be useful to confirm the presence of free air.
