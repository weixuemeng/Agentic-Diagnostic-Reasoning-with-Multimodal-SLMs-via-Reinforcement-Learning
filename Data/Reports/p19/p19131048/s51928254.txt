 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p gastrectomy, increasing WBC  // ?intrapulm
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been significant interval improvement in the layering right-sided
 pleural effusion which has now nearly completely resolved.  There is residual
 a atelectasis in the right lung base, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  A small left pleural effusion persists.  The degree of atelectasis
 has improved slightly at the left base.  A left-sided PICC terminates in the
 mid SVC.  No pneumothorax seen.  A tracheostomy is unchanged in appearance
 compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the right-sided pleural effusion with an airspace
 opacity at the right lung base likely reflecting atelectasis, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
