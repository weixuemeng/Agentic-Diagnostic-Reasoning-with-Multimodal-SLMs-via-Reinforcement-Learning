                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p distal gastrectomy for gastric outlet obstruction and GJ
 tube ___ c/b sepsis, afferent loop syndrome, ARF, now s/p takeback, repeat
 RNY, new handsewn DJ anastomosis with continued bile leak. s/p trach and pEG. 
 // to assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is in-situ.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium,
 this could be withdrawn 3-4 cm for better positioning in the distal SVC. 
 There are bilateral chest tubes in-situ.  These are unchanged in position when
 compared to the prior study.  There is persistent bibasal pleural effusions,
 similar in degree when compared to the prior study.  There is associated
 bibasilar atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 A right-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium, this could be withdrawn 3-4
 cm for better positioning in the SVC.
