 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:35 PM
  
  1. There is a right-sided PICC line identified, with distal tip projecting
  approximately over the low SVC versus cavoatrial junction.
  2. Transcutaneous pacer leads are seen overlying the left hemithorax.
  3. There are low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.
  4. Persistent vascular congestion.
  5. Small partially layering right pleural effusion.
  6. Right greater than left likely bibasilar atelectasis.
  7. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with now left chest tube removal  // assess for
 pneumothorax now s/p left chest tube removal      assess for pneumothorax now
 s/p left chest tube removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 15:56.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A skin fold projecting over the left lower chest laterally showed be mistaken
 for pneumothorax, but there may be a small apical pneumothorax new since
 removal of the left pleural drainage catheter.  There has been no increase in
 the volume of the small to moderate residual left pleural effusion.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion is smaller today than it was earlier in the day.  No
 right pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 unchanged.  No edema.  Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged.
 
 Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Tracheostomy
 tube midline.
