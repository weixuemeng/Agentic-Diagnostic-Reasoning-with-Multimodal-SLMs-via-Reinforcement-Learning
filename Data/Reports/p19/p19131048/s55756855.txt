                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F w/PMH significant for dementia, gastric ca s/p distal
 gastrectomy w/GJ tube placement w/multiple post-op issues including
 respiratory distress requiring trach, AV block with ventriculophasic sinus
 arrhythmia, and continued bile leak now failing to tolerate trach mask as
 previously able to  //  interval changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  Left-sided PICC line tip overlies the
 proximal SVC.  Right-sided PICC line is no longer visualized and has
 presumably been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen are what appear to
 be bilateral right greater the left effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to the prior study.  Some platelike atelectasis at the
 left base is more pronounced on the current study.  There is mild diffuse
 vascular plethora, not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right-sided PICC line.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.
