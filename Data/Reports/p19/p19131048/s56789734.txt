 cardiomegaly cannot be assessed.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. 
 Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction.  There is no evident

 retrocardiac atelectasis, adjacent amount of pleural effusion is probably
 unchanged.  Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of stable moderate
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
