 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation is seen. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Surgical clips overlie the right lower hemi
 thorax.  Extensive heterogeneity of the osseous structures is consistent with
 history of osseous metastatic disease.
