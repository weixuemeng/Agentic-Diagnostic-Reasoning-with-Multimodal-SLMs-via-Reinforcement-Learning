  1.  No evidence of injury.  
  
  2.  Widening of the right mediastinum, probably reflecting a cystic lesion
  (partly seen on CT).  Investigation with chest CT, preferably with intravenous
  contrast, if possible, is suggested when clinically appropriate (not
  suspicious for recent injury).

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with loss of consciousness and humeral deformity. 
 Question trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Limited comparison can be made to prior thoracic spine
 radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right upper mediastinal contour is bulging (part of this area
 is imaged on a CT of the cervical spine performed on the same day, suggesting
 a cystic lesion in the area), not significantly changed although long-term
 follow-up is not available.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The lung fields appear clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of injury.  
 
 2.  Widening of the right mediastinum, probably reflecting a cystic lesion. 
 Investigation with chest CT, preferably with intravenous contrast, if
 possible, is suggested when clinically appropriate.
