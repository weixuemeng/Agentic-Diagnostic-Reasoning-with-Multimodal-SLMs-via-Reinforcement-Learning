                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  Note is again made of a right
 paratracheal mediastinal bulge secondary to the previously seen mediastinal
 cyst.  No pleural effusions, pneumothoraces or focal consolidations are
 identified.  Again seen on the lateral radiograph is fracture of the mid shaft
 of the left humerus, overall stable compared to the prior exam. The lateral
 radiograph is limited due to the patient being unable to raise his arm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of focal consolidation.  Stable right paratracheal mediastinal
 bulge, due to known mediastinal cyst.
 
 2.  Stable fracture of the mid shaft of the left humerus.
