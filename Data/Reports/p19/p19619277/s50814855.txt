                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known bullous emphysema with mechanical fall.  Increasing confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from___ ___ at 5:46.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Heart size is
 normal.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are noted throughout the
 aorta.  Lungs are hyperinflated with bullous changes again noted most
 pronounced in the upper lobes.  Patchy opacities are re- demonstrated most
 pronounced in the right lower lobe, but also involving the right upper and
 left upper lobes.  Chain sutures are noted in the right apex.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacities in the right lower lobe as well as in both upper lobes
 concerning for areas of infection.  Previous CT also demonstrated airway wall
 thickening and small areas of mucous plugging in these areas of infection.
