                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sepsis, reported biliary stent obstruction
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. There is no
 overt pulmonary edema, nor is there a pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung
 volumes are low.  There appear to be patchy opacities in the lung bases which
 are nonspecific, and may be reflective of infection or aspiration.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Probable patchy opacities in the lung bases which are
 nonspecific, potentially reflective of infection or aspiration in the correct
 clinical setting. Consider repeat PA and lateral views of the chest when the
 patient is able to be positioned for these exams
