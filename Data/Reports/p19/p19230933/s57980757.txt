                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change in right-sided pneumothorax following
 insertion of chest tube in patient with disseminated lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph and CT of the chest obtained approximately six
 hours earlier, on ___ at 00:06.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest redemonstrate a right-sided
 pneumothorax, developed after placement of a pleural catheter.  There is no
 change in the size nor the degree of mild rightward shift of the trachea. 
 Underlying right hemi-thoracic opacity is due to disseminated replacement of
 airspaces with tumor, as supposed to a large component of pleural effusion. 
 The left lung is also unchanged, with diffuse opacities resulting from
 disseminated tumor.  There is no left-sided effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of disseminated lung cancer and right-sided
 pneumothorax.
