                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with disseminated lung cancer with tachycardia status
 post placement of right-sided pleural drainage catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  CTA of
 the chest from ___, taken approximately at the same time as this
 study.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates near-complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax with interval development of
 pneumothorax.  The pigtail catheter appears to lie in the expected location of
 the pleural space.  There is increase in the degree of rightward tracheal
 deviation.  Diffuse left lung opacities consistent with disseminated tumor as
 seen on the CT of the chest obtained at the same time.  There is no left-sided
 pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Development of pneumothorax without tension, after chest tube placement,
 better evaluated on the CT of the chest performed at the same time.
 2.  Opacification of the right hemithorax, when correlated with the CT
 findings, is mostly due to infiltration of airspaces with tumor as opposed to
 significant component of pleural fluid.
