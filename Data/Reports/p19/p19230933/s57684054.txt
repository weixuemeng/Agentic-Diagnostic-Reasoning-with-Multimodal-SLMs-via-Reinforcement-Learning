                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Additional history from
 the medical record includes history of lung cancer and brain metastases with
 one month of shortness of breath.  Treated for pneumonia two weeks ago.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is near-complete opacification of the right
 hemithorax, minimal aerated lung at the right lung base.  There is no
 significant shift of the mediastinum suggesting combination of underlying
 effusion with atelectasis and possible consolidation or cancer.  There is also
 increased parenchymal opacity in the left lung which is more confluent at the
 base in the lower lobe, which could represent a superimposed infectious
 process.  Underlying malignancy is also possible.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to assess given diffuse bilateral abnormalities. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax likely due to
 a combination of effusion and underlying atelectasis with possible
 consolidation/tumor.  Left lung regions of parenchymal opacity potentially due
 to infectious process with underlying malignancy also possible.
