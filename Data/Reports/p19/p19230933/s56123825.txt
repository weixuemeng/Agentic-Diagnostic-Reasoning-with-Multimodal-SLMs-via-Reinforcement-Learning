 and history of metastatic lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___, and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.  CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of
 the small pleural catheter.  There remains a substantial pneumothorax,
 particularly in the upper right hemithorax, although some of the air in the
 middle and lower hemithorax has been replaced, likely by fluid.  The near
 total opacification of the right hemithorax and extensive opacities in the
 left lung are a result of extensive tumor infiltration and unchanged.  Mild
 rightward tracheal shift is unchanged.  There is no left-sided pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistence of right pneumothorax with slight decrease in size or
 redistribution.
