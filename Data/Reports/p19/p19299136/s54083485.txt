 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Ischemic stroke, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  The
 tube could be advanced by approximately 5 cm.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged.  The pre-existing opacities are constant in appearance.  Unchanged
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
