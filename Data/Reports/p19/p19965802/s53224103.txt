                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 5:40 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with incarcerated parastomal hernia, assess
 for acute changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:38.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:40 a.m. is compared to a prior
 study of ___ at 12:38.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, left internal
 jugular large-bore catheter and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position,
 although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not identified on the current
 study.  An esophageal probe continues to have its tip in the proximal
 esophagus.  There continues to be small layering effusions, right greater than
 left, with increasing consolidation at the right base which may represent
 worsening atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is
 also likely patchy opacity at the left base which could represent atelectasis
 or pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given portable technique and
 differences in patient positioning.  Since the prior study, the pulmonary
 edema has improved but the bibasilar airspace process has worsened.
