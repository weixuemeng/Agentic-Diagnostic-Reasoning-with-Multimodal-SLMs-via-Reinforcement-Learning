                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with reduction of parastomal hernia, ETT placement, NG
 tube placement, lung volume.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Right upper lobe complete opacification, new since yesterday, is consistent
 with atelectasis and possible superimposed aspiration.  Considering the
 difference of technique from supine to semi-erect position, mild pulmonary
 edema has redistributed lower lung with mild atelectasis.  Pleural effusion is
 small if any.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube ends 3.9 cm above carina. 
 Right jugular line is in the mid SVC.  NG tube is below the diaphragm.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right upper lobe new consolidation is compatible with atelectasis with
 possibly superimposed aspiration.
 2.  Considering the difference of technique, mild pulmonary edema has
 redistributed in lower lung in this semi-erect exam.  
 
 This has been discussed directly by telephone with the ICU team.
