                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 13:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intermittent desaturations, right lower
 lobectomy two weeks ago, assess for infiltration, effusion, or collapse.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:40
 a.m.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest from ___ at 13:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, esophageal probe,
 left internal jugular large-bore catheter, and nasogastric tube are unchanged
 in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized on the
 current examination.  Bibasilar airspace consolidations with associated
 effusions, most likely reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Lung volumes are slightly lower
 than on the previous study.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
