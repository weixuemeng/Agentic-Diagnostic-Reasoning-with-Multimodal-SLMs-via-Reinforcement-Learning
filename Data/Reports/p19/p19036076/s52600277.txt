                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Positive PPD.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no interval change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No evidence of pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or old tuberculous disease.  The displacement of
 the trachea seen previously is not appreciated at this time.  Localized bulge
 of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged, probably related to partial
 eventration.
