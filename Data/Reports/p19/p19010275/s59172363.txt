                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
