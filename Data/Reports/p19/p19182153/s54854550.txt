                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting after fall with right rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACS at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No focal consolidation, edema,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is
 not widened.  This exam is not dedicated for imaging the ribs, but slight
 contour irregularity of the right lateral fifth and sixth ribs could indicate
 nondisplaced fractures or superimposed normal structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Possible right and sixth lateral rib nondisplaced fractures or
 superimposed normal structures.  Correlate with focal exam findings and
 recommend repeat dedicated rib films if confirmation is desired.
