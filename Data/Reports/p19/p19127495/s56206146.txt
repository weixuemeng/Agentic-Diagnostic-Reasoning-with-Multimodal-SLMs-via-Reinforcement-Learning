                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with wheezing, history of a large thyroid
 goiter and CHF, question edema or other causes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Please note that comparison to old films is helpful to detect
 subtle interval change.  PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 14:31
 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with underlying emphysema.  This
 increased right paratracheal soft tissue and it appears that there is
 deviation of the trachea.  Although these findings could be related to a
 thyroid goiter, without comparison images, this is difficult to ascertain and
 therefore a comparison to remote plain film images or CT should be considered.
 The heart is upper limits of normal in size with left ventricular prominence,
 consistent with a left ventricular hypertrophy.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  Streaky linear opacities at the
 left base likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Calcification of the aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine
 with no obvious vertebral compression fractures.  Osteopenia.
