                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman hypotensive with increasing O2 requirement s/p
 L gastric artery gelfoam embolization  // r/u PE
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:39 a.m. and allowing for technical
 differences, no definite change is identified.  Again seen is patchy opacity
 in the right infrahilar region and at the left base (previous chest x-ray
 suggested in the left lower lobe).
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  No new focal opacity is detected.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Densities in the upper abdomen likely relate to
 prior embolization.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, doubt significant interval change compared
 with earlier the same day.  Again noted (but better seen on the most recent
 prior study), are non-specific patchy opacities in the right middle and left
 lower lobes.
 
 Chest CT is recommended for further assessment of these opacities and for
 evaluation of the apparent interval increase in the size of the mediastinum
 compared with ___.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT is recommended for further assessment of these
 opacities and for evaluation of the apparent interval increase in the size of
 the mediastinum compared with ___.
