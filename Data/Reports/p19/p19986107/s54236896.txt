                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L gastric artery gelfoam embolization  //
 Please assess for interval change      .  Review of OMR indicates the the
 patient has undergone assessment for new onset hemo peritoneum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are curvilinear areas of parenchymal opacity in the right mid zone and
 an additional irregular opacity in the left base posteriorly.  These are of
 indeterminate acuity.  There are opacities that are somewhat similar in
 distribution seen on the ___ chest x-ray, but the distribution is
 not identical hand both opacities are larger and more pronounced on today's
 examination.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly and mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Although cardiac silhouette itself is probably not significantly
 changed, the mediastinal prominence is new and not clearly fully accounted for
 by technique.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar
 adenopathy is detected.
 
 No CHF, air bronchograms or effusions are identified.  Mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is more pronounced than in ___.  Mild left greater right
 apical pleural thickening is also more pronounced.
 
 Probable embolization material seen projecting over the upper abdomen distal
 left of midline, similar to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities at the right base and posterior left lower lobe are new or
 significantly changed compared with ___.  These are of indeterminate acuity
 and not fully characterized by a chest x-ray.  The differential includes
 infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic processes.  Further assessment with
 chest CT is recommended.
 
 Prominence of the mediastinum appears increased compared with ___.  Has there
 been a change in body habitus to account for this?  Attention to this area at
 the time of the chest CT is recommended.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Mild left-greater-than-right apical pleural thickening, slightly increased
 compared with ___.
 
 Embolization in the upper abdomen, likely in the region of the left gastric
 artery.  The appearance is grossly unchanged compared with ___.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT recommended to further assess opacities in the
 right middle and left lower lobes, with additional attention to mediastinal
 prominence.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr. ___
 ___ on ___ at 22:21 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
