                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, there is patchy right basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis
 in combination with vascular engorgement, although consolidation from
 infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusions are seen, although
 trace effusions will be difficult to exclude.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Hilar
 contours are prominent, likely accentuated by low lung volumes; however,
 pulmonary vascular engorgement may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Patchy
 right basilar opacity, pneumonia not excluded versus atelectasis.
 2.  Prominence of the hila, likely accentuated by low lung volumes; however,
 vascular engorgement may be present.
