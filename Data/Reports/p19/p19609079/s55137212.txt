                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new central venous line in the right
 internal jugular vein.  Please evaluate patent venous line following
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 09:12.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 line which terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  An endotracheal tube is in
 stable position, and an enteric tube terminates in the distal stomach.  There
 has been interval decrease in the low lung volumes causing crowding of the
 central bronchovascular structures.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity
 which may reflect atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is stable in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Appropriate positioning of support lines devices as described above.
 2.  Worsening low lung volumes with a left retrocardiac opacity which may
 reflect atelectasis.
