                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates in position 3.5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm.  Lung
 volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular structures,
 and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal in size, and no definite pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriate positioning of endotracheal tube.  Low lung volumes.
