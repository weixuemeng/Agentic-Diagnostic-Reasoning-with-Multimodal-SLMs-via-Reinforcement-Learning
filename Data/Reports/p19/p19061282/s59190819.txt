                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx trach, SCC of tongue a/w tongue bleed  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube midline and unchanged.  The right subclavian and
 brachiocephalic vein stent appears similar to prior.  The left brachiocephalic
 stent is unchanged.  The vascular catheter coursing through the IVC terminates
 in SVC.
 
 The diffuse bilateral lung opacities have increased slightly.  This is
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  The opacities in the left lung appears
 or nodule and discrete.  With known history of squamous cell carcinoma of the
 tongue, nodular metastases is on the differential.  Bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis is stable.  The mild to moderate right pleural effusion is stable.
 Minimal pleural effusion in the left lung.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Splenic ossification is again seen and unchanged. 
 The visualized vertebrae appear more sclerotic which could represent osseous
 metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased diffuse opacification is concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 
 2.  The left lung discrete nodular opacities are also worrisome for nodular
 metastases.
 
 3.  The sclerotic vertebrae are concerning for osseous metastases.
