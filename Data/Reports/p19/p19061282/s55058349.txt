 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of HIV, cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest is obtained.  Large area of
 consolidation in the right lung base is highly worrisome for pneumonia.  The
 left lung is clear.  Bilateral brachiocephalic stents are stable in position. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Innumerable rounded calcifications projecting over
 the spleen are again seen in this patient with history of prior granulomatous
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung consolidation worrisome for infection/pneumonia.
 Recommend followup to resolution to exclude underlying mass.
