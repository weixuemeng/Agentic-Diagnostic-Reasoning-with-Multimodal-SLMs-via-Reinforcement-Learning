                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, interval imaging.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, 11:10 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  No gross left effusion.  The left hemidiaphragm may be
 slightly elevated.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm overlying the fundus.  Again
 noted are stents of the right subclavian and left innominate vessels, with the
 tip of the right IJ sheath projecting over the right subclavian mesh stent.  
 
 Incidental note is again made of innumerable calcifications in the spleen
 thought to represent granulomas and diffusely increased density of the bones.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change compared with the film from one
 day earlier.
