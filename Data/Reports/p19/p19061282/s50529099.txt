                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right lower lobe
 consolidation has cleared.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 Vascular shunts are again seen, as are the multiple rounded calcifications
 projecting over the spleen.
