                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and history of HIV.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Compared to prior, there has been no significant
 interval change.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation.  Increased
 interstitial markings on one of the lateral views resolves on the second
 lateral view, likely due to improved inspiratory effort.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures. 
 Calcific densities projecting over the neck and left upper quadrant are
 unchanged, as are the vascular stents.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
