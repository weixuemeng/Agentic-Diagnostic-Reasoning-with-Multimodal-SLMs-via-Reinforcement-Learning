 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis and volume overload now with
 chest discomfort  // ?edema, effusion      ?edema, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 07:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 18:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left, which may not
 be significantly changed given differences in positioning.  Bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, likely reflect partial lower lobe
 compressive atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 There has been interval appearance of mild interstitial edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
