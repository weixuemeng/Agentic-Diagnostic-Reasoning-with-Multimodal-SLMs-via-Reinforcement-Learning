                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with dyspnea and crackles at the left base,
 evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest ___.
 2. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The mediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. The trachea is midline. Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted. Linear opacities in the left lung likely reflect
 post treatment lung parenchymal changes, as seen on prior exams. Linear
 opacities within the right lower lung likely reflect minimal atelectasis.
 There is no focal lung consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion. There
 is no pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.  There is mild anterior
 wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body, grossly unchanged from prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
