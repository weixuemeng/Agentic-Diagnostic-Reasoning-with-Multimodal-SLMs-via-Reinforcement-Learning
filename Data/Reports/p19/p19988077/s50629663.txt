                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bleeding from tracheostomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable, though the superior mediastinum is not well assessed as the
 patient's chin obscures this region. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged
 position. Hilar contours are normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle may suggest a small pleural effusion.
 Retrocardiac patchy opacity and minimal right basilar opacity likely reflect
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified but the apices are not well
 assessed due to the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck obscuring
 these regions. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes, but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded completely.
