                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation.  The heart size is normal. The left hilus
 demonstrates a rounded opacity which is indeterminate but likely overlapping
 vessels.  The hilar structures and pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Rounded prominence of the left hilus is likely vascular, however,
 given the provided history a CT is recommended for further characterization.
