                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.  Question pneumonia or free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. There is no free air.
 
 Previously, the left hilar region was thought to be slightly rounded in its
 contour however, recent chest CT demonstrated this was vascular in origin and
 not due to lymphadenopathy.  There was a borderline lymphnode seen on that CT
 for which recommendation was for repeat limited CT with contrast. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
