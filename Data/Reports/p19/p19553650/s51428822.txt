 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right middle lung cancer, status post lobectomy, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient carries a right-sided chest tube.  The tube is in
 correct position.  There is no evidence of right apical pneumothorax. 
 However, a small post-procedural pneumothorax could be present at the level of
 the right costophrenic sinus.  There is no evidence of tension.  An opacity in
 the upper regions of the left hemithorax is strongly suggestive of left upper
 lobe atelectasis.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumonia.
