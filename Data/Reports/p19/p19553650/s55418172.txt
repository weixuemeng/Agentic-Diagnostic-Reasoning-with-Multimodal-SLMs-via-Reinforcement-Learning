                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right middle lobectomy, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the right base medially with clearing of the apical
 pneumothorax.  This most likely reflects volume loss, though supervening
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 The left lung is clear.
