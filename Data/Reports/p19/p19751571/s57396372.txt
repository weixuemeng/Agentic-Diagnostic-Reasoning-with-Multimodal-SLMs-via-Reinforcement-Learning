                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 8:58 a.m.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD. A tracheostomy tube is in
 place. The patient is status post sternotomy, with cardiomegaly.    A
 dual-lumen right-sided catheter is present, distal tip overlying right atrium.
 An additional right subclavian line is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC. NO
 ptx detected. 
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Probable small left effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF.  There is atelectasis at the right lung base.  No right-sided
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with probable small left
 effusion.  This is similar, possibly slightly worse, compared with ___.   
 2) The dual-lumen catheter is new and the Dobbhoff catheter has been removed.
 3) Otherwise, no gross change.
