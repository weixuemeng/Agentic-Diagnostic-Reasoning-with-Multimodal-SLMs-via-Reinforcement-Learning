 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve
 replacement with dropping saturation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 at 10:55 a.m.
 
 The current radiograph demonstrates hazy opacities projecting over both lung
 bases, but most likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and layering
 pleural effusion.  The tubes and lines are in unchanged position.  The
 retrocardiac areas of atelectasis are unchanged.  No overt pneumothorax is
 seen.
