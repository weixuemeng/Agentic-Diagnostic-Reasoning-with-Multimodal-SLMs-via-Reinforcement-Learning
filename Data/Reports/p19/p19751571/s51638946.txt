                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pulmonary edema flail mitral valve, position ET
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 7:54 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube has been repositioned, but it is still low, ending 2.2 cm above the
 carina.  The intra-aortic balloon pump has been lowered and sits 3 cm below
 the aortic knob, which is adequate.  NG tube and right subclavian line is in
 adequate position.  Moderate pulmonary edema which is asymmetric right more
 than left is unchanged since previous exam, but significantly improved since
 ___.  Left lung base opacification has improved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube has been repositioned, but still is slightly too low, terminating
 2 cm above the carina.  The remaining of the tubes and lines are in adequate
 position.
 2.  Unchanged asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema right more than left.  
 
 The results have been discussed with the ICU resident at 10:11 a.m.
