                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___ dating between ___ and ___, as
 well as prior chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly and upper zone vascular redistribution, but
 decreased in extent of bilateral perihilar haziness and bilateral septal
 thickening, suggesting improved pulmonary edema in the setting of interval
 diuresis.  Geographically marginated opacities in left juxtahilar region
 correspond to apparent post-radiation fibrosis on prior CT chest of ___, and correlation with previous treatment history would be helpful in this
 regard.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has decreased in size and a
 small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study.  Pericardial
 calcifications are noted, best visualized on the lateral view, and correlate
 to findings concerning for constrictive pericarditis on prior CTA of the
 chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving pulmonary edema.  An underlying chronic interstitial process
 cannot be excluded, and continued radiographic followup may be helpful in this
 regard.
 2.  Improving right pleural effusion and persistent left pleural effusion.
 3.  Post-treatment changes in left juxtahilar region.
 4.  Pericardial calcifications as described above.
