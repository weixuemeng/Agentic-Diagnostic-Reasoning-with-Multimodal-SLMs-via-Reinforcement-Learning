                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Urinary retention.  Evaluate for right lower lobe loculated
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph is a ___, ___ abdomen ___. 
 Chest CT from ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The large right loculated pleural effusion is unchanged from
 yesterday.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small
 left pleural effusion.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  There is worsening of
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Evidence of prior sternotomy and coronary
 pericardial stripping is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged, large right loculated pleural effusion.
 2.  Worsened moderate pulmonary edema.  
 3.  Focal opacity of the right upper lung may reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema or a secondary process such as infection.  Evaluation after diuresis is
 recommended.
