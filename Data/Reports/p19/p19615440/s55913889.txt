                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are slightly improved lung
 volumes.  There are substantial right and small pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The right cardiac border remains
 obscured.  There are some left paramediastinal parenchymal opacities with
 fibrotic or atelectatic streaks extending to the left lateral wall.  According
 to the recent CT, this could reflect prior radiation therapy.
 
 There is displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left, raising the
 possibility of a thyroid mass.
