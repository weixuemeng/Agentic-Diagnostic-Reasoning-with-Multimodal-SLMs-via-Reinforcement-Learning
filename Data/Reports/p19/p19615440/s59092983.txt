                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracentesis and pericardial stripping.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again appreciated are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions; the amount on the left unchanged and decreased on the right,
 expected after thoracentesis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Again appreciated
 are perihilar and bibasilar opacities and vascular congestion compatible with
 edema.  Longstanding appearance of paramediastinal fibrosis is compatible with
 history of radiation therapy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent edema.
