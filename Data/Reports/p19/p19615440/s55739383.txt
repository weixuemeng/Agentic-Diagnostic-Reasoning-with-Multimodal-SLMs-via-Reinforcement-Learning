 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for right apical pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post pericardial stripping.  The effusion on the right has
 minimally decreased in extent.  The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at both
 lung bases are decreased in severity.  The small calcification at the left
 lung apex is not well visualized on today's radiograph.
 
 There is no evidence of a right apical or apical lateral pneumothorax. 
 Constant alignment of sternal wires, the size of the cardiac silhouette is
 constant.
