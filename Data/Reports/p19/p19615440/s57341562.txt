                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger than on the
 study of 2 days prior.  There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly with
 pulmonary vascular redistribution and alveolar infiltrates most marked in the
 lower lobes, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Continued CHF with moderate bilateral pleural effusions and underlying
 infectious infiltrate can't be excluded, particularly on the right.
