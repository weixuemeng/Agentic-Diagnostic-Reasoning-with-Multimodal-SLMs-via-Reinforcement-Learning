                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right middle cerebral artery
 stroke, course complicated by cerebral edema.  VAP, dysphagia, now status post
 Dobbhoff placement.  Patient with vigorous coughing that caused Dobbhoff to
 change position, evaluate placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained five hours earlier during the same day.  Evidence of left-sided
 pleural effusion obliterating the entire left-sided diaphragm as before. 
 Aeration of left upper lobe area has slightly improved.  Right hemithorax
 unremarkable as before.  A Dobbhoff line is identified,reaching well below the
 diaphragm and the tip of the line having a caudal direction before it escapes
 the lower image border.  In comparison with the next preceding study, the
 position of the Dobbhoff line is completely unchanged.  Previously described
 right internal jugular approach central venous line terminates in unchanged
 position in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly improved aeration of left upper lobe but persisting
 sizable pleural effusion and probably atelectasis in left lower lobe area. 
 Dobbhoff line in unchanged position.
