                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe collapse, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the evidence of atelectasis
 at the left lung bases has substantially increased, with just a minimal area
 of left lung parenchyma remaining ventilated in the region of the apex.  There
 is considerable shift of the mediastinum towards the left.  The monitoring and
 support devices are constant in appearance.  Known extensive right apical
 pleural thickening with partly calcified parenchymal scars.  No other change
 in the appearance of the right lung.
