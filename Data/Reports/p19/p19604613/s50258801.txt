                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative persistent oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly better
 inspiration.  Little change in the appearance of the somewhat enlarged cardiac
 silhouette without evidence of vascular congestion.  Blunting of the lower
 right costophrenic angle with lateral displacement of the dome of the
 hemidiaphragms suggests some subpulmonic pleural effusion.  The degree of gas
 beneath the hemidiaphragm on the left has substantially decreased.  On the
 lateral view, there is a small amount of gas in this region, consistent with a
 small amount of postoperative residual pneumoperitoneum.  Generalized ileus
 pattern is noted.
