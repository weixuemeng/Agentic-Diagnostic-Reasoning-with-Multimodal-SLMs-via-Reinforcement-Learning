                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/o BLE edema with Hx Hep C and CHF  // ? CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is prominence of the hila, particularly on the right which may be due to
 prominent pulmonary vessels although underlying lymphadenopathy is not
 excluded. No priors available for comparison. No focal consolidation seen.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable. There may be mild vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the hila may relate to prominent pulmonary vasculature, however,
 cannot exclude lymphadenopathy on the right.  Correlate with any prior chest
 radiographs if available, otherwise, suggest nonurgent chest CT for further
 evaluation.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
