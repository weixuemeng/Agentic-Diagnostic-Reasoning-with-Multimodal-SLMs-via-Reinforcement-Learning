                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough with bloody sputum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the right perihilar lung is consistent with
 either pneumonia or aspirated blood.  Similarly greater opacification in the
 infrahilar right lung could be either atelectasis or pneumonia.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are new and pulmonary vasculature is newly
 engorged, so that even though heart size is normal, findings suggest mild
 heart failure.  Findings were posted to the online record of critical
 radiology findings for direct notification of the referring physician.
