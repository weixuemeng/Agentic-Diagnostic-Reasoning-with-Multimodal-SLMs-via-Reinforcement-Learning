                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fall and head strike.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette including tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 stable.  Lung volumes are low.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no large effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. No displaced fractures; however, conventional chest radiography is not
 sensitive for detection of rib fractures.
