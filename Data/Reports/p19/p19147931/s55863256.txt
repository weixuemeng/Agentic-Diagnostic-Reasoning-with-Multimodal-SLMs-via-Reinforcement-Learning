                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach.  As on the
 study of ___, there is substantial tortuosity of the aorta and
 brachiocephalic vessels.  Dense streak of atelectasis is seen at the right
 base, though there is no acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 Nodular opacification in the left mid zone is consistent with previously
 described granuloma.  There is suggestion of a second nodule above it that was
 not definitely seen on previous study.  Since this could represent a
 fortuitous combination of shadows, this area should be closely evaluated on
 subsequent images to determine whether there is a real parenchymal process.
