                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Choking while eating.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___, ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Several
 nodules in the left lung appear unchanged; to some extent these may be
 calcified.  A nodular focus projecting over the lower right chest is most
 suggestive of a nipple shadow and unchanged.  Streaky opacities are somewhat
 increased at the left lung base but probably due to minor atelectasis.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Compression deformities
 along the upper lumbar spine are not well visualized, but there is no
 indication of change.  No foreign body is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacities most suggestive of atelectasis. 
 No foreign body identified.
