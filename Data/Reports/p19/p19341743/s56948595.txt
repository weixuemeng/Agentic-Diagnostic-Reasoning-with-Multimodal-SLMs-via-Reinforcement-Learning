                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Eating disorder.  Recent admission for lower GI bleed now with fever
 and constipation, fevers, elevated white count.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:29 a.m.
 
 An orogastric-type tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film.  The tubing seen over the left lung apex may represent the proximal
 portion of that.  
 
 There is opacity at the right lung base with a sharply demarcated superior
 border thought to correspond to the level of the minor fissure.  There is
 partial aeration at the right lung base, particularly in the region of the
 right cardiophrenic angle.  The upper portion of the right lung is grossly
 clear.  The left lung is grossly clear.  The opacity in the right base is
 significantly progrssed compared with ___.  Findings are new compared with
 ___.  The right hemidiaphragm is also elevated, unchanged. 
 
 There is probable mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.  No
 gross effusion is detected on either side.  No overt CHF.  The extreme upper
 apices are excluded from the film, but there does appear to be right greater
 than left biapical pleural scarring.  Mediastum remains midline and, aside
 from persistent elevated right hemidiaphragm, no significant anatomic shift is
 noted. 
 
 At the periphery of these films, fixation hardware is seen in the lower lumbar
 spine.  Background mild scoliosis and degenerative change noted. 
   
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progressive opacity at the right lung base.  Given sharp demarcation at the
 expected site of the minor fissure, this is suggestive of a segmental or
 partial lobar pneumonia.
