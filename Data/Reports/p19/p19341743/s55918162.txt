                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  There is mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. 
 However, an entirely new focal opacity projecting over the right mid lung
 raises suspicion for pneumonia.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No free air identified.
 
 2.  New focal right mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Correlation with clinical presentation is
 suggested.  Short-term followup radiographs are also suggested to reassess.
