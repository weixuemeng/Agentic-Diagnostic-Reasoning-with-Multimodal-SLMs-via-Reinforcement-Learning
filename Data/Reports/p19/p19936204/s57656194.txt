  Subdiaphragmatic lucency spanning the midline, similar to prior.  This most
  likely represents pannus, given similar appearance across multiple prior
  exams.  However, if there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum, CT of the
  abdomen and pelvis could be obtained for further evaluation.  Substantial
  right middle lobe atelectasis and small left lower lobe atelectasis are
  unchanged.  Right PICC terminates in the lower SVC.  Bilateral internal
  external biliary stents are incompletely evaluated.
