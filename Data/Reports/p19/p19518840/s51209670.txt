                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shoulder replacement with increasing agitation and hypoxemia, to
 assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Low lung volumes may account for the
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  However, there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.  Mild atelectatic
 changes are seen at the left base.
 
 Of incidental note is the total shoulder replacement on the left and cervical
 fusion.
