 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening hypoxia  // assess effusion /
 fluid status      assess effusion / fluid status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 With the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Some mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles which could reflect
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
