                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea, vomiting, recent right lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 persistent small right apical pneumothorax.  There is persistent elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with some tenting seen consistent with volume loss. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again seen, and there may be a
 small left pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are also
 stable.  There is mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body,
 likely grossly stable.
