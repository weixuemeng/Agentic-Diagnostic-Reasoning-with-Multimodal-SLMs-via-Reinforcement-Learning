                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with diabetes presents with fever, chest pain and
 cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  There is subtle increased opacity projecting in the right
 mid lung, not significantly changed from prior.  Somewhat linear opacity seen
 in the right lung base medially, likely within the lower lobe could be due to
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Biapical scarring again noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased opacity in the right lower lobe, potentially due
 to atelectasis; however, developing infiltrate cannot be excluded.
