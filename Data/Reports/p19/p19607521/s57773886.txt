                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with right suprahilar
 opacity.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Left suprahilar opacity which represents a combination of superior segment of
 left lower lobe opacity and potentially bronchiectasis appears to be grossly
 unchanged since the prior radiograph.  No evidence of new abnormalities
 demonstrated.  Rest of the lungs are clear.  Heart size and mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  Apical thickening is bilateral, stable.
