                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sudden onset abdominal pain, fevers and
 leukocytosis  // r/o pneumonia, pleural effusions      r/o pneumonia, pleural
 effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  No evidence of cardiomegaly or vascular congestion.
 The left hemidiaphragm is less distinct with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle.  This could well represent merely atelectatic change and pleural
 effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be seriously considered.
