                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of endocarditis and hypoxia, please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___ and CTA aorta
 bi-fem-iliac from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly which appears to have increased in
 size compared to the prior exam.  There appears to be increased pulmonary
 vascular engorgement as well as diffuse bilateral mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  There is a new small left pleural effusion.  However, the small
 layering right pleural effusion has appeared to redistributed compared to the
 prior exam with interval increase in opacification over the mid right lung. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Persistent retrocardiac opacification is identified
 and likely secondary to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slight interval increase in bilateral mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Redistribution of the small right and new left pleural effusion.
