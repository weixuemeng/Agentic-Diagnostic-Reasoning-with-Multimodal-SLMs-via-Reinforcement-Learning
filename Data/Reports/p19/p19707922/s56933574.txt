                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a substantial nodular opacity projecting along the left lower lung
 which may be associated with a nipple shadow or confluence of soft tissue or
 even potentially atelectasis but when clinically appropriate evaluation with a
 chest CT is recommended in order to exclude a true lung nodule.  Otherwise the
 lungs appear clear.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Nodular opacity in the left lower lung, possibly an artifact or focus of
 atelectasis, but when clinically appropriate chest CT follow-up is recommended
 to evaluate further.
