                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, unresponsive, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating at the
 carina.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 3 cm for more optimal
 positioning.  A nasogastric tube has also been placed in the interval with
 distal tip at the GE junction, side port within the distal esophagus. 
 Recommend advancement by approximately 15 cm so that it is well within the
 stomach.  Subtle patchy left mid lung opacity is seen which may represent
 overlap of vascular structures however small focus of infection may be
 present.  Minimal right costophrenic angle atelectasis is seen.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
