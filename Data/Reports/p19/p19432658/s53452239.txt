                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with past history of adenopathy.  Assess change in
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There has been a substantial decrease in what is still severe central
 adenopathy, with particular involution in the subcarinal, paraesophageal
 station, and both lower paratracheal stations, and probably in the
 aortopulmonic window.  The right hilus is still enlarged, and the left is more
 readily visible with decrease in adjacent mediastinal nodes.  Lungs are clear
 and the heart is normal size.  There is no pleural effusion, nor is there
 indentation on the stomach or displacement of the splenic flexure to suggest
 any splenomegaly.
