                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
 pneumonia.  The relative ___ of cardiac size and pulmonary vascularity
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion.
