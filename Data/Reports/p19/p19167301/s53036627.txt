                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ngt replaced  // NGT
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its
 tip is not visualized.  The ETT has since been removed.  Lung volumes remain
 low.  Asymmetric opacity of the right lower lung is perhaps minimally improved
 and may reflect atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Replaced nasogastric tube is likely in the stomach.
 2.  Slight interval improvement in right atelectasis and small right pleural
 effusion.
