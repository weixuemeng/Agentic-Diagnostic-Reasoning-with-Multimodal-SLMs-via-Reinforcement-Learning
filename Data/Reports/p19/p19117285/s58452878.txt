                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker and dyspnea.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left chest
 wall pacemaker leads are unchanged in position ending in the right atrium and
 right ventricle. Heart size is top normal and unchanged. There is no focal
 consolidation. A right pleural effusion could be moderate in size if there is
 a subpulmonic component, which is suggested by the diaphragmatic contour. No
 left pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. A
 1.0cm nodule projecting over the anterior second rib is unchanged from
 ___ but not clearly seen on ___.  Degenerative change is noted in
 the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Right pleural effusion with suggestion of subpulmonic component. A lateral
 decubitus film could be performed to better quantify the amount of fluid. No
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 2. 1.0 cm nodular opacity projecting over the right anterior second rib. ___
 degree shallow oblique radiographs are recommended to distinguish a bone
 island in the rib from a lung nodule.
 
 Findings entered into the radiology critical results dashboard for
 communication to the ordering provider ___ ___:32am on ___.
