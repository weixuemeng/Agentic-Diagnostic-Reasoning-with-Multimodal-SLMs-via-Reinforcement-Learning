                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with encephalopathy of unclear origin, concern
 for evolving VAP  // evidence of PNA?       (VAP is presumed to stand for
 ventilator assisted pneumonia.)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Markedly rotated and lordotic positioning, which makes comparison to the prior
 film challenging.  Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the
 gastric fundus.  A right IJ sheath is seen.  Allowing for rotation, this
 probably similar to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is quite difficult to assess due to extreme differences
 in positioning.  Likely vascular plethora and scattered parenchymal opacities.
 On the right, the appearance is probably similar to the prior study.  No gross
 right effusion.
 
 On left, comparison to the prior study is quite difficult due to differences
 in positioning.  No definite interval change on the left.  No gross left
 effusion.
 
 Right and left hemidiaphragms remain well defined.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Likely vascular plethora and scattered parenchymal opacities.  Comparison to
 the prior film is quite limited due to differences in position and technique. 
 No definite worsening.  Possible slight improvement in the left upper zone. 
 Hemidiaphragms remain well-defined.  No gross effusion detected on either
 side.
