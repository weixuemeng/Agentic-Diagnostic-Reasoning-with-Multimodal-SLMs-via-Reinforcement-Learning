  More dense consolidation in the lingula and right middle lobe.  Some of this

 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities localizing to the middle lobe and lingula. 
 While some of this could represent scarring and prominent fat pad as seen on
 prior chest CT, findings are slightly progressed even given differences in
 technique.  There is also some streaky retrocardiac opacities on the lateral
 view which may correlate with mucous plugging seen on prior chest CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Degenerative changes partially visualized at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More dense consolidation in the lingula and right middle lobe.  Some of this
 may be due to the atelectasis, scarring and prominent fat pad, there is
 suspected superimposed acute infection given apparent progression of these
 changes since recent prior chest CT.
