                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma of unclear etiology with epidural and subdural hematoma
 status post left craniectomy C5 spinous process fracture, frontotemporal skull
 fractures, evaluate for interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:08 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies 2 cm above the carina, pointing towards
 the right mainstem bronchus.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the
 diaphragm.  A left subclavian central line tip overlies the mid/distal SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with prior film, there is increased retrocardiac density, with
 obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Possibility of a small left effusion cannot be
 excluded.  Mild upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Aside from
 minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region, which is probably
 slightly worse, no focal infiltrate is seen on the right.  No gross right
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 2 cm above the carina, at the lower limits of the range of
 positioning, pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus.
 2.   Developing left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Possible small
 left effusion.
 3.  Atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region, which may be slightly
 worse.
 4.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 5.  There is some prominence of the right hilum compared to the prior film, of
 uncertain etiology or significance.  Possibly due to vascular engorgement. 
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
