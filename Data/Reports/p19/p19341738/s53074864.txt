                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with stab wounds to
 epigastrium and left axilla.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusion
 is most likely present.  Left pneumothorax seen on the CT torso is not
 definitely visible on the current study after insertion of the chest tube.  No
 interval development of other abnormalities demonstrated.  The decrease in the
 pleural effusion is also noticeable as compared to prior studies.
