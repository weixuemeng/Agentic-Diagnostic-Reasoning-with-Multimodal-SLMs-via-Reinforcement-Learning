                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter terminates at the SVC /right
 atrial junction.  Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal but
 accentuated by the low lung volumes.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is likely present.  Patchy airspace opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis.
