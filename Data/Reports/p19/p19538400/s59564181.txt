                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.  Question consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate interval
 increased suggestion of peribronchial cuffing in the right greater than left
 infrahilar region particularly on frontal view, less conspicuous in the
 lateral view, raising question of interval development of pneumonia although
 atelectasis could potentially explain the findings.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and
 thoracic aortic tortuosity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, concerning for bronchopneumonia.
