                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, vomiting  // pCXR: eval for
 consolidationCT head: eval for ICHAbd Pain: eval for abd abscess
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ reference made to chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, there has been interval improvement in increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally with prominence of the interstitial markings
 remaining, but to a lesser degree, may be due to very gradually improving
 process, as suggests an on prior chest CT from ___ ; possibly very
 gradually improving infectious with possible underlying cryptogenic organizing
 pneumonia.  However, since the prior CT from ___, today there
 appears to be increased blunting of the right costophrenic angle raising
 concern for a small right pleural effusion and possible pleural thickening. 
 No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, right slightly greater than left,
 which overall appear improved as compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, as suggested on prior chest CT from ___, findings may
 relate to a very gradually improving infectious process with possible
 underlying cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.  New blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle raises concern for a small right pleural effusion and
 possible pleural thickening.
