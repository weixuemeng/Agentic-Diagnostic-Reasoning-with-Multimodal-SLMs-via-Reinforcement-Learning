                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check for free air while sitting up.
 
 FINDINGS:  The film is labeled supine, but the gravity marker shows a more
 erect position.  There is increased opacity in the right chest with some
 pulmonary vascular re-distribution.  This likely represents alveolar edema
 that is asymmetric.  This is markedly worse compared to the prior study.  The
 left IJ line has been removed.  The left lung is clear.  The heart is upper
 limits normal in size.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asymmetric pulmonary edema.
