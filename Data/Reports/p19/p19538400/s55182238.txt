 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen in the lungs bilaterally, more
 conspicuous on the right than the left as seen on prior.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable, top-normal in size.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at
 the aortic arch. No acute osseous abnormalities.

 represent pulmonary edema although atypical infection can have a similar
 appearance.
