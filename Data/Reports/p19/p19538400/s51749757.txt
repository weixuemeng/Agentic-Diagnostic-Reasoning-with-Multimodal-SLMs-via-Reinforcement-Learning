                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with chronic kidney disease and decreased breath sounds at
 bases.  Assess for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral displacement of left lung base apex reflects subpulmonic
 disposition of effusion that could be same size as prior.  Small left pleural
 effusion.  Decrease in pulmonary edema with clear right upper lobe and left
 lung. Stable mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette with dilated mediastinal
 vein. No pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Subpulmonic disposition of right effusion, likely unchanged in size.
 2.  Stable mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette may relate to dilated
 mediastinal veins; however, unclear if small pericardial effusion present.
 3.  Improvement in pulmonary edema.
