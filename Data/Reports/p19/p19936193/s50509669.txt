                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  History of well-controlled epilepsy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  New streaky posterior
 basilar opacification, partly obscuring the posterior right hemidiaphragm is
 suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Projecting over the right mid lung is a new
 irregular nodular focus, possibly a confluence of shadows but a developing
 pulmonary nodule should be excluded with further chest imaging when clinically
 appropriate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Possible lung nodule; evaluatin
 with chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate.
