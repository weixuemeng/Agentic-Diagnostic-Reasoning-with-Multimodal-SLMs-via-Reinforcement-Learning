                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath with exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is chronic.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate to severe multilevel
 degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.
