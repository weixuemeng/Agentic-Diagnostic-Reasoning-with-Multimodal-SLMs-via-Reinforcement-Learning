                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p  EVAR  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 22:22 , subcutaneous emphysema in the right
 supraclavicular of the region may be  more pronounced. Again seen is a right
 IJ sheath, with tip over proximal SVC.  Note is made of a gap in tubing at the
 proximal edge of the sheath measuring 6.7 mm.  On today's examination 2 small
 clips are seen in the right neck, away from the sheath and subcutaneous
 emphysema.  In retrospect Beaver present at the edge of the prior film.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and vascular plethora, with bibasilar atelectasis, is similar to the prior
 study.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette I doubt significant interval change.  No
 pleural effusion seen on either side.  No obvious pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular  region may be slightly
 more pronounced.  As noted, there is a possible interruption in the right IJ
 sheath tubing versus two adjoining pieces of tubing, though this appearance is
 similar to the prior film.  Clinical correlation is requested for further
 assessment.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The appearance of the right IJ sheath and right supraclavicular
 subcutaneous emphysema was discussed by Dr. ___ with the covering PA by
 phone ___ min after discovery at 18:53 on ___.
