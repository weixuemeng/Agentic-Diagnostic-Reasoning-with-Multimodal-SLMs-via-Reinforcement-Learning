                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  View is an apical
 lordotic view which somewhat limits the evaluation, though allowing for this,
 the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
