                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Alcohol withdrawal with multifocal pneumonia.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Right-sided IJ catheter and NGT are
 in stable position.  Multifocal consolidations and peribronchial
 consolidations involving the right lung have progressed from 24 hours prior. 
 However, confluent opacification of the left lower lobe remains the worst
 site.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well
 delineated due to the consolidations.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multifocal pneumonia in the right lung.
