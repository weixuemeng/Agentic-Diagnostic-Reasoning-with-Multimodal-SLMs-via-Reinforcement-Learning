                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral pneumonia.
 
 CHEST SEMI-ERECT AP
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Position of the various lines and tubes is unchanged.  The interstitial patten
 present on the prior chest x-ray is unchanged.  No effusions are seen, and
 this would favor aspiration pneumonia rather than failure as a cause.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change.
