                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pneumonia post-intubation placement.
 
 CHEST AP
 
 The endotracheal tube lies 5.5 cm from the carinal angle.  Tip of the
 nasogastric tube lies in the subdiaphragmatic position.  The PICC line lies in
 the lower SVC.
 
 Diffuse interstitial patten is present in both sides, worse than on the prior
 chest x-ray consistent either with aspiration pneumonia or a possible failure
 though effusions are not present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Support lines and tubes in satisfactory position, worsening lung
 pattern.
