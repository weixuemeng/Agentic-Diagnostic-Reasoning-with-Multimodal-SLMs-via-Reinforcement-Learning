                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of alcoholism
 and delirium tremens after extubation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  There is interval improvement of right basal
 consolidation.  Still present bilateral pleural effusions are noted. 
 Improvement in the consolidation is most likely consistent with improvement of
