                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o ___ pack year, COPD who presents with
 left chest pain.  // Please eval for fracture vs malignancy
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint is difficult to
 compare because of patient rotation, but it was also present on prior
 radiograph ___ ___.  Left diaphragmatic contour abnormality posteriorly
 on the lateral view, has not changed since ___ but is a change from
 ___.  Old rib fractures bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint has been present since at
 least ___.  Dedicated AC views may be performed if the patient has pain
 at this location.
 2. Round contour of posterior left hemidiaphragm is similar to ___ but
 increased since ___.  This probably represents focal herniated fat from a
 diaphragmatic defect.  However, if clinically warranted, CT chest may be
 performed to differentiate herniated fat from a localized fibrous lesion of
 the pleura.
