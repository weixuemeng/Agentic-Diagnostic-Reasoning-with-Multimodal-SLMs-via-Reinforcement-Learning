                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated  // eval ett position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube is noted with tip and side-port seen within the stomach.  Patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged, with the heart size remaining moderately enlarged.
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Small right pleural effusion is
 present. There are streaky opacities in the lung bases possibly reflective of
 atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. Multilevel degenerative changes
 are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, small right pleural effusion.
 3. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis but aspiration is not
 excluded.
