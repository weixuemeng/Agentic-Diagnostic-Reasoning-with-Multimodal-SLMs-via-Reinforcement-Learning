                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 There is a small rounded opacity overlying the mid right lung laterally which
 was not apparent on prior imaging, and which may represent a small pneumonia
 in the right clinical setting.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominent hilar lymphadenopathy is again
 seen, suggestive of sarcoidosis and unchanged from prior exam.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small rounded opacity overlying the mid right lung laterally
 which was not apparent on prior imaging, and which may represent a small
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  If opacity does not clear with
 antibiotics, CT is recommended to further evaluate.
