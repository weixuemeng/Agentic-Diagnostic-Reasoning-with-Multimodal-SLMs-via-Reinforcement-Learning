                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again bilateral hilar enlargement, compatible with lymphadenopathy,
 which has worsened since the prior radiograph, more so in the right. 
 Increasing micronodular opacities in the right upper and lower lung may
 represent worsening sarcoid, less likely superimposed pneumonia.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased right perihilar micronodules may represent worsening sarcoid,
 however infection is also a possibility.
 2.  Increased bilateral hilar prominence consistent with lymphadenopathy.
