 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and phlegm production.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged.  Tortuous aorta is re-demonstrated,
 unchanged.  Dilated vessels in the right upper mediastinum are noted.  Right
 basal opacity appears to be slightly more pronounced than on the prior study,
 but still most likely reflects an area of atelectasis with mild pleural
 thickening.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No new masses or
 consolidations demonstrated.  Slight impression on the right tracheal wall by
 the enlarged right thyroid gland is re-demonstrated, unchanged and better
 appreciated on the CT of the chest obtained on ___.
