 mediastinum on the right.  This has the appearance of tortuosity of the
 vessels, especially given that the density is not seen above the clavicle.  No
 acute osseous abnormality identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Rounded density in the right
 paramediastinal region, potentially tortuosity of the great vessels, however
 given lack of prior or other exam to confirm, nonurgent chest CT is suggested.
