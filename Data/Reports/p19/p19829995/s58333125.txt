                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure, here to evaluate for
 evidence of acute heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is moderate
 dextroconvex curvature of the mid-to-lower thoracic spine with resultant
 asymmetry of the rib cage.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. 
 The thoracic aorta is tortuous, but the mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There is partial calcification of the aortic knob.  No pulmonary edema, focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Dense mitral valve
 annular calcifications are re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute heart failure or volume overload.
