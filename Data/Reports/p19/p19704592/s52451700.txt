 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of COPD.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged, and could suggest chronic
 pleural thickening.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There
 are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
