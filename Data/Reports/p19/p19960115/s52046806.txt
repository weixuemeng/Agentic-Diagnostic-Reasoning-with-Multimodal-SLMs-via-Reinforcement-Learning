                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, septic  // interval chanfe
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 5.9 cm above the carina
 and lies at the level of the clavicular heads.  The tip of a left subclavian
 line overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 There are bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including prominence of the SVC,
 is enlarged, but unchanged.
 
 Compared with ___ at 05:42, the CHF findings may be slightly worse,
 but the appearance is otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF, with bibasilar effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 The possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
 The appearance is overall similar to 1 day earlier, but the CHF findings could
 be slightly worse.
