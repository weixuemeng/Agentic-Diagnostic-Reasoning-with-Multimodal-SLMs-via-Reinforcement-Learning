                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest provided.  Endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip residing approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.  An OG tube extends to the
 left upper quadrant, though the tip is not clearly visualized.  Scattered
 pulmonary opacities raise potential concern for aspiration and atelectasis,
 though lung volumes are quite low.  Heart size is grossly stable.  Mediastinal
 contour is difficult to assess.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET and OG tubes positioned appropriately.  Scattered pulmonary
 opacities raise potential concern for aspiration and atelectasis.
