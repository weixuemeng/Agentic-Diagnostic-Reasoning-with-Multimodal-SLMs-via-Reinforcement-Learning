                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left lower extremity weakness.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.  CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate post-operative
 changes of right-sided thoracotomy and lobectomy with stable architectural
 distortion.  A focal right hilar density appears more pronounced as compared
 to ___ but similar as compared to ___, which may be in part
 related to rightward patient rotation.  There is no additional opacity in the
 lung.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or large effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No definite confluent consolidation to suggest infection.  
 2.  Prominent likely stable right hilar density could be related to prior
 surgery but subtle supervening early infection cannot be excluded and should
 be clinically correlated.
