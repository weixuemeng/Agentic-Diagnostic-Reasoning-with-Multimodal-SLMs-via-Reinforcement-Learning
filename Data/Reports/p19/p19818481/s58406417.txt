                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ex lap for postop bleeding, new ET tube and
 aspiration event.  Evaluate for ET tube position, infiltrate or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal semi-erect radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ET tube
 ending 2.3 cm above the carina.  A enteric tube passes below the diaphragm
 with tip out of view at the inferior edge of the image. Bibasilar opacities
 could reflect aspiration given the clinical history. Likely small left pleural
 effusion.  No right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Stable mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and mediastinal borders.
