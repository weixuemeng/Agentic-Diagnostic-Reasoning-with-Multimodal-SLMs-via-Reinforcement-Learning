                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and tachycardia. Positive blood cultures and
 known mitral valve prolapse.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Asymmetric
 heterogeneous opacification suggests multifocal pneumonia in the right lung.
 Right mid lung opacities are vague but somewhat rounded so septic nodules are
 possible this may perhaps be explained primarily by pneumonia.  There is also
 a fairly well defined right infrahilar opacity suggesting pneumonia with air
 bronchograms. In addition, although more diffuse vague bilateral opacification
 may also be due to infection, coinciding pulmonary edema is suspected.  There
 are probably small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest multifocal pneumonia, probably with coinciding pulmonary
 edema and small pleural effusions. Right mid lung opacities are vague and
 perhaps somewhat nodular; relatively large septic emboli air are possible but
 these may be primarily areas of consolidation.
