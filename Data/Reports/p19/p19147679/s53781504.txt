                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right complicated effusion status post attempted pigtail
 catheter, to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with the recent
 radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, lateral loculated component in the mid thorax
 has completely resolved, while the fissural component is smaller. Right lower
 lung opacity reflecting combination of loculated effusion and atelectasis is
 similar.  Minimal left lower lung atelectasis has improved.  Upper lungs are
 clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
