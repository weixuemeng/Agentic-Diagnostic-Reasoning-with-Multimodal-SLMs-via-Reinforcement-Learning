                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  New diagnosis of syphilis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Band-like
 opacity projecting over the cardiac border on the lateral view suggests minor
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. 
 Slight rightward convex curvature of the mid thoracic spine is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting minor atelectasis in the right middle lobe
 without findings suggestive of pneumonia.
