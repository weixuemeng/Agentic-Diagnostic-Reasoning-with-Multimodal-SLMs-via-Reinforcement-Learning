                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of newly intubated,
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 3 cm below
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm and terminating in the expected location of the distal stomach.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 Paratracheal opacity is again seen as also seen on the prior study.  Subtle
 medial right base patchy opacity could relate to aspiration.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Subtle streaky medial right base opacity could relate to aspiration
 depending on the clinical situation.
