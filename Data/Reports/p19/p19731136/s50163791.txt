                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Possible seizures, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum.  Tip terminates probably in the
 region of the pylorus.  ET tube remains in good position, 2.5 cm above the
 carina.
 
 There is a patchy left lower lobe atelectasis with focal silhouetting in left
 hemidiaphragm.  There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions or at
 least blunting is noted here.  Slightly increased lung markings in the right
 lower lung zone may reflect developing pneumonia or some right middle lobe
 atelectasis.  There is symmetrical opacification of the medial aspect of both
 upper lobes, with smoothly convex lateral margins, presumptively vascular but
 further evaluation might be indicated.  Again, the appearances are not
 significantly changed from prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No significant change from prior study.  Worsening left-sided atelectasis and
 right middle lung zone change, possibly also represents atelectasis.
 
 Bilateral upper mediastinal changes.  I note chest CT from ___
 showing presence of a massive goiter as well as significant tortuosity of the
 great vessels.  CT also suggests there was lower lobe atelectasis and even a
 small amount of middle lobe atelectasis is suggested on current radiograph,
 but the appearances have deteriorated since then.
