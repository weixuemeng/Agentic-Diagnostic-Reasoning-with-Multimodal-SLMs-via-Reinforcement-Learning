 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:20 PM
  Interval retraction of the endotracheal tube, which now projects about 6.5 cm
  above the carina. Advancing the tube 2.5-cm is recommended. Orograstic tube
  tip in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum, starting to curve inferiorly.
  Unchanged course of right sided vascular catheter, which courses slightly
  medially; blood gas could be helpful to confirm venous placement. Bilateral
  pleural effusions. Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:07 p.m. on ___
  at the time of discovery of these findings and request for wet read.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there was interval
 retraction of the endotracheal tube.  Tip of the tube now projects about 6.5
 cm above the carina.  The tube should be advanced by approximately 2 cm.  The
 orogastric tube is in the distal part of the stomach or the proximal duodenum.
 Unchanged course of the right internal jugular vein catheter.  Small to
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Overinflation of the stomach is no
 longer present.
