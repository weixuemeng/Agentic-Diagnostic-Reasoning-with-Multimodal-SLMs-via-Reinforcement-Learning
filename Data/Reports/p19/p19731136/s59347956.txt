                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stridor, tracheal deviation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of potential tracheal deviation to the left, without evidence of substantial
 tracheal narrowing on the frontal radiograph.  On the lateral radiograph,
 however, it appears as if the trachea would be substantially narrowed.
 
 Precise reason for the narrowing and the extent of the assumed mediastinal
 lesion should be evaluated by CT.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Low lung volumes.  Right PICC line.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the finding was posted to the
 radiology dashboard.
