                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Assess for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip ends just 6.5 mm above the carina.  Consider
 retracting the endotracheal tube by 3.5 cm for appropriate seating.  Right
 internal jugular line tip ends approximately in the mid/upper right atrium. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Mildly increased retrocardiac
 density suggesting of lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.  Increased opacity
 in the right paratracheal and upper mediastinum from a known goiter causing
 mild indentation on the tracheal air column has unchanged since at least ___ and better evaluated on a chest CT dated ___.  An orogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm into the stomach, however, its distal end off
 radiographic view.
 
 Finding regarding the endotracheal tube was already discussed by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___, ___ at 9:34 p.m.
