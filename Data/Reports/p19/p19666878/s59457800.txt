 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates high, approximately 9 cm above carina.  NG
 tube tip and side hole are in the stomach.  New small left pleural effusion is
 seen.  A component of left lower lobe atelectasis is likely present. Patchy
 right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection. There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminating 9 cm above the carina.  Recommend advancing this 5-6
 cm for optimal positioning.
 2.  New small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
