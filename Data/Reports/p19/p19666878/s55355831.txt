                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic angiosarcoma, presenting with hypoxia, status post
 intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is
 still in situ.  The tip of the tube projects 5 cm above the carina.  At the
 right lung base, a pre-existing parenchymal opacity is slightly bigger than on
 the previous image.  In addition, subtle air bronchograms are seen.  This
 finding should raise the suspicion for pneumonia.  There is unchanged blunting
 of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting small pleural effusion.
 Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged remaining monitoring and
 support devices.
