                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits aside from patchy calcification along the aortic
 arch.  There is minimal subpleural scarring at the left lung apex.  A mild
 interstitial process suggests congestion.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Small-to-moderate anterior osteophytes are present along the
 mid to lower thoracic spine.  A healed old left sixth rib fracture is present.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality, probably due to slight fluid
 overload or vascular congestion.
