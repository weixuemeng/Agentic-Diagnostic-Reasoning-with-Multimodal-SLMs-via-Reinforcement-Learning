                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with evaluation of known aortic dissection s/p
 repair w/new intermittent intrascapular pain  // eval mediastinum or and c/f
 dissection     eval mediastinum or and c/f dissection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Again there is evidence of median sternotomy with intact sternal wires.  Dense
 calcification is seen in the region of the aortic arch and there is mild
 tortuosity of the descending portion.  No acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  Specifically, at the limits of plain
 radiography there is no evidence of dissection.  If this is a serious clinical
 concern, CT or MRI would be the next imaging procedure.
