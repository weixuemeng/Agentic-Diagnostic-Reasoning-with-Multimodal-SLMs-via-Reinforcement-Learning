                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCV cirrhosis, question volume overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, lower than on ___ at 4:55 a.m.  Again
 seen are dense bilateral alveolar opacities, with faint air bronchograms. 
 These are similar to prior, though there has been probable slight improved
 aeration along the periphery of both lungs.  No gross effusion is detected on
 either side.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 Again seen is a right IJ central line with tip over right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dense bilateral alveolar opacities.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 this would be compatible with continued pulmonary edema, but with evidence of
 slight improvement.
 
 2.  Right IJ central line overlying the right atrium.  Clinical correlation to
 assess for possible retraction is requested.
