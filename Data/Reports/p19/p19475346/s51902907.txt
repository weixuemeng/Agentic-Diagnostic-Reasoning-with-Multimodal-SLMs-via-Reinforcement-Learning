                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation of Dobbhoff tube location.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright frontal chest/abdominal radiograph demonstrates a Dobbhoff
 tube ending in the left upper quadrant.  The curvature of the Dobbhoff tube
 suggests that it is within the fourth portion of the duodenum.  There is a
 right central venous catheter line ending in the right atrium.  The bowel gas
 pattern is unremarkable.  There is retrocardiac opacity in the left lung base,
 perhaps in large part an effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The curvature of the Dobbhoff tube suggests that its tip is
 within the fourth portion of the duodenum. A radiograph could be considered
 after injection of contrast into the tube for definite confirmation of tip
 location.
