                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cervical adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, without obvious explanation, not
 sufficiently to raise any concern for phrenic nerve palsy.  Lungs are
 otherwise fully expanded, and clear.  There is no pleural abnormality or
 evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size is normal.
