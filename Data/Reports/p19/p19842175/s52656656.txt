                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Ill-defined opacities in the right lower lung are not well seen on the lateral
 projection and likely represent mild atelectasis, although infection cannot be
 excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is mild to moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild wedging of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body is noted.  Note is made of a left side pacemaker with right
 atrial and ventricular leads.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Mild right lower lung atelectasis, less likely infection.  
 
 2. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
