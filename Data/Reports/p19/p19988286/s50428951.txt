                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, productive cough from recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: None. 
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Both lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Please note that opacification in bilateral lung
 bases likely represents underpenetration due to patient's body habitus.
