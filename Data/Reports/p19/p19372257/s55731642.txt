 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:09 PM
  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Right chest wall Port-A-Cath ends
  in the low SVC.  Left subclavian central venous catheter also ends in the low
  SVC.  Since prior, there has been interval increase in airspace opacities,
  most pronounced in the lower lobes, concerning for infection versus pulmonary
  edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset dyspnea and desaturation, with
 significant worsening since this morning  // Interval change? Any worsening in
 acute processes?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  A left-sided
 subclavian catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  A right internal jugular
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 normal.  There has been progression of the bilateral basal airspace opacities.
 This may reflect pulmonary edema versus is infection.  Given the normal heart
 size, the latter is considered more likely.  No pleural effusion seen.  An
 endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is 4.7 cm above the carina.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in the bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for infection versus
 pulmonary edema.
