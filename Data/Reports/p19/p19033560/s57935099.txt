                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, on cycle 5, day 4
 of chemotherapy, presenting with chills, question source of infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A Port-A-Cath is
 again noted residing over the right chest wall with catheter tip located in
 the SVC.  Subtle opacities in the lateral aspect of both lungs likely reflect
 overlying osseous lesions given patient's history of multiple myeloma.  There
 are linear densities again noted in the left mid to lower lung as well as the
 right mid lung likely representing areas of plate-like atelectasis.  There is
 no lobar consolidation or definite signs of pneumonia.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly unremarkable.  There is a retrocardiac density containing air which
 could represent a small hiatal hernia.  The imaged osseous structures appear
 grossly stable with new thoracic compression fracture and numerous rib
 deformities likely related to patient's history of multiple myeloma.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia.
