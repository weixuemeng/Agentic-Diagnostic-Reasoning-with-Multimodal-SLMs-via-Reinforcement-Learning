                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic arch replacement.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate retrocardiac
 opacifications, unchanged compared to ___, likely representing
 combination of atelectasis and stable small left-sided pleural effusion.
 Streaky opacifications in the right lung base likely represent minimal
 atelectasis.  Small stable right pleural effusion.  There is stable
 enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorta, with no radiographic perceptible
 increase in diameter. Interval removal of right central venous sheath
 catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right, likely
 combination of atelectasis and stable small pleural effusions.  Stable
 mediastinum, unable to differentiate between aorta and hematoma at this point.
