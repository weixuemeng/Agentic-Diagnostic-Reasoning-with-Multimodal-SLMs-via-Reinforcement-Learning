 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:25 AM
  No change in the size of the mediastinum.  Patient extubated and PA catheter
  removed.  Upper lungs are much better aerated as edema has cleared.  Bilateral
  lower lobe atelectasis and left greater than right small pleural effusions are
  present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Drop in hematocrit.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:32 p.m., the ET tube, NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter
 have been removed.  Mediastinal drain remains present. A right IJ sheath
 remains present, tip over proximal SVC.  Right axillary surgical clips again
 noted.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, including increased density in the region of the
 left hilum which most likely represents a combination of pulmonary artery and
 descending aorta.  This appearance is less pronounced than on the prior study,
 in part due to differences in technique. Patchy opacity at both bases, similar
 to the earlier study, consistent with atelectasis.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.  A small left effusion, with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter, ET tube and NG tube.  
 2) Aortic arch prominent, but less pronounced on the prior study -- please see
 comment above.   As before, the appearance of the mediastinum should be
 correlated with details of the surgical history.
 3) CHF findings may be slightly improved.  Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
