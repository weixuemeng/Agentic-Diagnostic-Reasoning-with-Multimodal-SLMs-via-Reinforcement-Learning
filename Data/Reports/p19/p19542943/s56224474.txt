 HISTORY:  Syncope and malaise.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates calcifications particularly at the aortic knob.  There is minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen, though there is
 mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Mild degenerative changes
 are noted within the thoracic spine.  Degenerative changes are also seen
 within both acromioclavicular and right glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly without evidence for congestive
 heart failure.
