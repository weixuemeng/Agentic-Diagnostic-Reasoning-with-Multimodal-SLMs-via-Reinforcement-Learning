 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post removal of endotracheal tube.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Persistent moderate-sized partially
 layering right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacity favoring
 atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia.  Small left effusion and minimal
 left basilar atelectasis are again demonstrated as well.  Small left pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening with adjacent minimal linear left basilar
 scar.
