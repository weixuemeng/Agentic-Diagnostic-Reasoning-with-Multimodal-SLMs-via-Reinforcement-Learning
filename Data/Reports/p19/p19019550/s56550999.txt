                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malfunction of right ventricular lead, here to evaluate RV lead
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position with two leads. 
 The right atrial lead appears in appropriate position on this single frontal
 view.  The right ventricular lead appears retracted into the right atrium
 compared to the most recent prior study of ___.  There is improved
 aeration at the right base from the most recent prior study with persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No significant focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  The
 visualized upper abdomen shows surgical clips in the right upper quadrant
 compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retraction of right ventricular lead into the right atrium
 compared to the most recent prior study of ___.
 
 Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ cardiology via telephone
 at 3:50 p.m. on ___.
