                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration risk, meningitis, new fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 A right PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC, unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  
 
 Compared with prior film, there has been some interval clearing at the left
 base, but left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with possible small
 left effusion remains present.  Patchy opacity in the right base/cardiophrenic
 region is also slightly improved.  The CHF findings have also improved, though
 there is residual upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with an element of residual CHF.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, but probably also slightly improved.  
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  Incidental
 note is made of a left shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, right base patchy opacity, cardiomediastinal enlargement, and
 CHF findings.  However, residual bibasilar opacities and mild residual CHF
 remain present.
