 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:01 PM
  Interval placement of the enteric catheter which terminates in the fundus of
  stomach.  Recommend advancement several centimeters to ensure that the side
  port is beyond the GE junction.  Interval increase in and retrocardiac and
  left lower lung opacification possibly representing increased atelectasis
  though a component of effusion or infectious process is not excluded. ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach, though the side port is at the GE junction,
 should be advanced several centimeters for more standard position.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Right central
 catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Increasing left
 lower lobe opacities are a combination of increasing focal small effusion and
 adjacent consolidation.  This consolidation could be atelectasis and/or
 infection/pneumonia.  The right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
