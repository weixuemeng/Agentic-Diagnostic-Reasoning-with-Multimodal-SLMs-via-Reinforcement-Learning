                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bibasilar crackles, increasing o2 sat
 requirements  // evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and mildly enlarged.
 Prominence of the interstitial markings and vascular markings bilaterally
 suggest component of pulmonary edema.  Right basilar opacity is seen which
 could be due to atelectasis, aspiration, infection not excluded. The left
 costophrenic angle not fully included on the image, thoracic spine CT earlier
 today, showed small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. 
 Multiple chronic right-sided rib deformities are again seen. Chronic deformity
 of the distal right clavicle again noted.
