                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax status post removal of chest tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:56.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously noted pigtail chest tube has been removed.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen.  Subcutaneous emphysema within the left neck and left
 lateral chest and abdominal wall appears slightly increased compared to the
 prior exam.  Hazy opacification within the left lung base likely reflects a
 combination of a small pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.  Patchy
 right basilar atelectasis is also demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumothorax identified post removal of chest tube.  Slightly increased
 amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the left neck and left lateral chest
 and abdominal wall.  Small left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
