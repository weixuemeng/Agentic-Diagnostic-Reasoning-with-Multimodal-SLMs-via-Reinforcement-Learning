                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pigtail catheter tip projects over the left upper lung field, with
 a moderate amount of subcutaneous emphysema seen in the left chest wall
 extending into the left neck.  A small apical left pneumothorax is present. 
 Patchy opacity within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion may be present.  No
 right-sided pneumothorax is seen.  There is minimal atelectasis in the right
 lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post left pigtail chest tube placement with persistent small left
 apical pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema within the left chest wall and
 left neck.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis with possible
 small left pleural effusion.
