                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The visualized lung fields show coarsened lung markings which may reflect
 chronic lung disease.  There is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease
 including pleural effusions, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Coarsened lung markings could represent
 chronic lung disease, which can be evaluated by non-emergent CT if continued
 concern.
