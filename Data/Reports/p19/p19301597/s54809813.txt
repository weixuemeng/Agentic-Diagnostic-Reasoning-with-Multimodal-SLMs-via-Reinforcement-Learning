                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An interstitial abnormality has
 substantially improved, although there is still peribronchial cuffing which
 can be identified with a heterogeneous distribution, predominantly in the
 lower lungs, greater on the right than left, a fairly similar overall pattern
 to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of airway inflammation, but no definite
 pneumonia.
