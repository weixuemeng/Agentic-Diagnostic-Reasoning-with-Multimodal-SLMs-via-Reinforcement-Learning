                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post pedestrian struck by
 automobile, injuries.  Right clavicular fracture, bilateral rib fractures,
 bilateral pneumothoraces, sternum fracture, evaluate injuries.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright
 position using frontal AP and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding portable single chest view examination of ___. 
 Marked improvement is noted in as much as lung fields and both sides do not
 show any remaining pulmonary parenchymal densities and the diaphragmatic
 contours as well as the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from
 any fluid accumulation.  The previously existing pulmonary congestive pattern
 has normalized.  As before, orthopedic hardware for stabilization of thoracic
 spine injury seen on the frontal view consistent of two ___ rods with six
 pairs of penetrating fixation screws into the vertebral body column from the
 posterior aspect.  There is a moderately increased kyphotic curvature in the
 thoracic spine and rather extensive degenerative changes are noted.  The
 fixation screws penetrate at level T4, 5 and 6 and again T8, 9 and ___. 
 Apparently, they are stabilizing an injury of the vertebral body in
 intermediate position; however detail of any injury is not detectable on this
 single lateral view.  On previous CT, multiple rib fractures have been
 identified, but the present examination with plain frontal view and lateral
 view does not allow skeletal evaluation in detail.  There is no evidence of
 any gross malalignment or separation.  The same holds for the sternum which on
 the lateral view does not show any gross displacement anywhere.  It should be
 noted, however, that the permanent pacer is overlying the area of the
 syndesmosis between the manubrium and the corpus of the sternum.  Previously
 described pacemaker connected to two intracavitary electrodes as before
 terminating in position compatible with right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Again there is mild degree of cardiac enlargement but no evidence of acute
 pulmonary congestion.  Previously described fracture in the mid portion of the
 right clavicle appears unaltered.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post pedestrian struck by
 automobile injuries.  Right clavicle fracture, bilateral rib fractures,
 bilateral pneumothoraces, sternum fractured, re-evaluate all injuries.
 
 Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright position
 using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the next
 preceding AP single view chest examination of ___.
