                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post left chest tube discontinued.  Please assess for
 interval change, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ at 5:24 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph evaluation is somewhat limited by
 rotation. Interval removal of right-sided chest tube with possible interval
 development of a small right pneumothorax.  Increased opacification of right
 upper lobe may reflect degree of associated collapse.  There has been notable
 interval improvement of aeration of the bilateral lung bases with residual
 atelectasis in the left lung base and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Stable cardiac enlargement with improved but persistent vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube with development of
 small right apical pneumothorax with new right upper lobe opacification,
 possibly representing degree of collapse.  Improved vascular congestion and
 aeration of lung bases.
