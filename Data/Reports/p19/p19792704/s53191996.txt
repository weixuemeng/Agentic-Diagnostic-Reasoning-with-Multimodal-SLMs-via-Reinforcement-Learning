                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib and sternal fractures with right chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Extensive opacification at the right base is again consistent with
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Chest tube remains in place and there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with evidence of vascular congestion.
