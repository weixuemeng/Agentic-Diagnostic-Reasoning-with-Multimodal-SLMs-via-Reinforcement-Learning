 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a cough, elevated white count, question
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, perhaps due to emphysema.  There is no focal
 pulmonary abnormality, pleural effusion, or evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement.  A small bone island in the anterior right fourth rib should not
 be mistaken for a calcified granuloma.
