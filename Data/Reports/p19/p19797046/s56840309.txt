 infiltrate or edema?

 Heart size top-normal.  Left lung clear aside from vascular congestion.
 Vascular congestion is also present in the right lung but there are areas

 of active infection or even malignancy from more benign causes.
 Small pleural effusions are likely. There is no pneumothorax.
