                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.  Enlargement of
 central pulmonary vessels is consistent with previously provided history of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  On the frontal view, there are no focal
 areas of consolidation.  However, diffuse increased density is present
 overlying the spine on the lateral view, which is limited by combination of
 low lung volumes and respiratory motion.  Minimal basilar interstitial
 opacities may reflect interstitial edema and have improved since previous
 ___ radiograph of ___.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present as well as a small amount of fluid in the fissures.  High-grade
 compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine is unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and minimal interstitial edema.
 
 2.  No definite pneumonia, but basilar pneumonia cannot be fully excluded on
 lateral radiograph.  Considering the suboptimal technique on the lateral view,
 repeat lateral radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to
 exclude basilar pneumonia if warranted clinically.
