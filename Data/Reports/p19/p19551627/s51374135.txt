                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F intubated, pls eval tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal. Calcification of the aortic knob is present.  Lungs
 are well-expanded. There is mild pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the right
 hemidiaphragm with hazy opacity likely reflects a layering pleural effusion
 with underlying atelectasis.  Developing consolidation is not excluded.  There
 is no large left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube is
 present in standard position.  An enteric tube is present with distal tip not
 captured but sideholes just distal to the GE junction.  A right axillary dual
 lead pacemaker is present with tips expected positions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support devices in standard positions. Increased opacity at the right base
 likely reflects layering pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 edema.
