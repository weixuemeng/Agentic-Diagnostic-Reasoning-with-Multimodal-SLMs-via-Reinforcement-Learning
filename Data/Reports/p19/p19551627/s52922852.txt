                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-craniotomy, to assess for fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of
 normal or mildly enlarged, and the pulmonary vascularity shows minimal
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The hazy opacification at the right
 base suggestive of layering effusion has improved, though it is unclear
 whether this could merely be a manifestation of a more erect position of the
 patient.
