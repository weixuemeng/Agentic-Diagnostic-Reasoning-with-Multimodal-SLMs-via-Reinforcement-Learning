 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with tip now terminating
 5.5 cm above the carina.  Other indwelling devices remain in standard
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Slight
 improvement in left retrocardiac atelectasis and adjacent small left pleural
 effusion, but a small left apical pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size,
 and there is no evidence of right pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion
 and adjacent right basilar atelectasis are unchanged.
