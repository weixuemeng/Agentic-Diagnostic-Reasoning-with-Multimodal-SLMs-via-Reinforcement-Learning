                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 2 hours prior on the same
 day, as well as ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal expiratory chest radiograph again demonstrates a left
 apically directed chest tube in place.  The small left apical pneumothorax is
 decreased in size, but persistent.  Left rib fractures are unchanged.  Lung
 volumes are lower, with increasing bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 increased atelectasis.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent small left apical pneumothorax, decrease in size.
 2. Increasing bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, given lower lung
 volumes and expiratory technique.
