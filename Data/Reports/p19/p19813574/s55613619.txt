                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with possible occult infection.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Re-demonstrated are diffuse interstitial
 opacities most prominent in the lung bases, left greater than right.  Findings
 are consistent with chronic underlying interstitial lung disease.  As compared
 to multiple prior examinations, the severity is similar, therefore no definite
 superimposed edema or infection is evident.  There is stable blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic angles, which appears slightly improved from prior and
 likely related to chronic pleural thickening.  No definite effusion is
 evident.  There is no definite new consolidation.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged. 
 Re-demonstrated are calcifications of the aortic arch and descending aorta. 
 There is mild unchanged cardiomegaly.  Circumscribed rounded densities
 overlying the heart on the lateral view may represent something outside of the
 patient.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial lung disease, though no gross evidence for
 superimposed pneumonia or edema.
