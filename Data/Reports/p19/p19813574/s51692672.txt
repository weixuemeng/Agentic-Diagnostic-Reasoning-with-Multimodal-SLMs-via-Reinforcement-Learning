                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with presyncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph dated ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Diffuse
 interstitial abnormality worst at the lung bases and periphery persists. There
 are increased interstitial markings compared to the ___ exam,
 suggestive of superimposed volume overload.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are also new since prior.  Heart size has mildly increased.  Pulmonary artery
 remains prominent, suggestive of possible underlying pulmonary hypertension. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are again noted.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Degenerative joint changes of the
 thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ exam, diffuse interstitial abnormalities have
 progressed with interval development of small pleural effusions and mild
 enlargement of the cardiac size.  The above findings most likely reflect
 worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease.
