                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  There is a single-lead left-sided AICD with
 lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.  There
 is subtle increase in opacity projecting over the right lung base which may
 have been present on the prior study although is not well evaluated.  Findings
 may be due to underlying infection or aspiration versus prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.
