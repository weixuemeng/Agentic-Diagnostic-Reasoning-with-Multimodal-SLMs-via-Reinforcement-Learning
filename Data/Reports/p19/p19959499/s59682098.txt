                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 ___ as well as an aortic CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval increase in right lung base opacity.  In
 addition, diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild
 interstitial edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  An ICD
 monitor is seen overlying the left hemithorax, with a single lead ending in
 unchanged position in the inferior wall of the heart.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Relative increase in opacity
 at the right lung base could be due to underlying infection/pneumonia or
 relate to assymetric fluid overload.
