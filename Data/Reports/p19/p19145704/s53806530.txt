                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present though assessment is
 mildly limited as the left costophrenic angle was not included in the field of
 view. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities. These findings are concerning for
 infection or aspiration given the history of fever. Follow up radiographs
 after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of these findings.
