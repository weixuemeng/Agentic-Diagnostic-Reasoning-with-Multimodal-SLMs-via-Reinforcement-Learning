                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 expanded.  A 1cm trianguar opacity projects over the inferior margin of the
 right hilus and is not explained by normal structures.  There is no
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Apparent 1cm nodule projecting over the right hilus may be due to summation of
 shadows.  Repeat radiographs with routine oblique views are recommended to
 confirm the authenticity of the finding.
