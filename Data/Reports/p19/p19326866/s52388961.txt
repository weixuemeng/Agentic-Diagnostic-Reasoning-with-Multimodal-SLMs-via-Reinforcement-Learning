                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lethargy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded. There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  A percutaneous catheter balloon is seen in the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
