                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic cancer, abdominal pressure, pleural effusion, shortness
 of breath, tachypnea.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  Low inspiratory volumes.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 17:32 p.m., there has been an increase in the
 effusion at the right lung base, now small-to-moderate, with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  A right-sided chest tube is again seen.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  There is patchy
 retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, possibly slightly worse.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 but no definite CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 2.  Slight worsening of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
