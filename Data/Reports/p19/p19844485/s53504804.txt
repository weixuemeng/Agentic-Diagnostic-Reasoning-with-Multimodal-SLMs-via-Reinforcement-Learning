                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a CT torso from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the prior
 exam, there is increased opacity at the right lung base which could represent
 a combination of atelectasis and effusion, though underlying pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  Lung volumes and
 evaluation for mild pulmonary edema is limited.  There is no overt edema.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the right lung base, likely a combination of
 effusion and atelectasis, though underlying pneumonia difficult to exclude.
