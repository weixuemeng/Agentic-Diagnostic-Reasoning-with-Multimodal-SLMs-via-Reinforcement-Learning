 effusion or worsening pneumonia.  Improvement in perihilar opacification in
 the left mid lung may be a function of difference in radiographic technique. 
 The area is not clear, whether it is edema or a second focus of pneumonia, is
 radiographically indeterminate.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is longstanding.
