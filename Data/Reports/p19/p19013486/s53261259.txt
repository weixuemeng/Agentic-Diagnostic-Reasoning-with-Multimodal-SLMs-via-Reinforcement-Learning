                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Empyema status post pigtail catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two AP portable views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new pigtail catheter projecting over the left lower hemithorax with
 marked reduction in a pleural effusion, which is now small.  There is a new
 small pneumothorax following insertion of the catheter. Reduction and pleural
 effusion reveals a similar cavitary lesion at the left lung apex to the
 earlier study. The right lung remains clear. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear probably unchanged. The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked reduction in left pleural effusion after catheter placement.  Small new
 left-sided pneumothorax.
