                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  Prominent interstitial lung markings as seen on ___, may be related to mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated on this single
 frontal view.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased lung volumes with probable mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.
