                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings again seen throughout the lungs which are
 unchanged and were further characterized by a prior CT. Linear left basilar
 opacity may represent superimposed atelectasis although infection is not
 excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs compatible with a chronic
 underlying process better seen by prior CT. Linear left basilar opacity may be
 due to superimposed atelectasis although acute infection would be possible.
