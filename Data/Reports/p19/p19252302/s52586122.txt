                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of CHF and COPD.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 low, and allowing for this, subtle increase in the bronchovascular markings
 likely reflects some degree of crowding of bronchovasculature, though mild
 pulmonary edema would be difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.
 There is no overt sign of pneumonia.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild interstitial edema.  Limited exam due to low lung
 volumes.  Otherwise grossly unremarkable.
