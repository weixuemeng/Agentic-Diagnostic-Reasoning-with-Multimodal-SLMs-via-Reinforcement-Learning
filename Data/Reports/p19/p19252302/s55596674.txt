                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath and weight gain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is an
 unchanged persistent diffuse interstitial abnormality.  Although vascular
 congestion may mimic this appearance, the lack of change suggests that this is
 probably primarily due and perhaps solely due to emphysema and mild
 interstitial lung disease of long chronicity. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar persistent interstitial abnormality.
