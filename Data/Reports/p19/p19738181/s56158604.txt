                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncopal event  // intracranial hemorrhage or
 injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung bases a relatively under penetrated due to overlying soft tissue.
 There are low lung volumes. Given the above, patchy medial right basilar
 opacity most likely reflects overlap of vascular structures or possibly
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion is seen. There is evidence of pneumothorax.
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are grossly
 unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Somewhat under penetrated due to body habitus. Given the
 above, subtle medial right base opacity most likely reflects overlap of
 vascular structures or possibly atelectasis, with aspiration or infection felt
 less likely.
