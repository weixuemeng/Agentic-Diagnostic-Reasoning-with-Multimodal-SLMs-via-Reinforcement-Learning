                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion and reported right pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  There is moderate right-sided
 pneumothorax.  The maximum distance between the inner chest wall and outer
 pleural edge is about 3.5 cm.  The pneumothorax appears probably unchanged. 
 There is very slight leftward shift of mediastinal structures although perhaps
 slightly decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right-sided pneumothorax including minimal leftward shift.  The size
 of the pneumothorax appears not significantly changed and the degree of shift
 slightly decreased.
