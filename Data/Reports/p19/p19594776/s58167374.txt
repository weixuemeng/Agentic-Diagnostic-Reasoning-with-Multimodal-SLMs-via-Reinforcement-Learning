                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count, right upper quadrant pain and
 increased oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely top-normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 is present.  No pneumothorax or overt pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present.  An inferior vena cava filter is detected.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
