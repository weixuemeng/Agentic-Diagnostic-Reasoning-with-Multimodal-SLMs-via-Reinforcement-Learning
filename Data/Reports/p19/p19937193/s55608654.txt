                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal
 linear atelectasis at the left lung base, but no focal areas of consolidation
 to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  Relative flattening of hemidiaphragms
 suggests the possibility of COPD in the appropriate clinical setting.  Bones
 are diffusely demineralized, and degenerative changes are present within the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear left basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
