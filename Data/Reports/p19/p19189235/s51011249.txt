                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  There are again patchy
 opacities in both lower lungs, more extensive in the left lower lobe than
 right but considerably improved.  It is difficult to exclude small persistent
 effusions but these are markedly improved.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving pleural effusions and basilar opacities with persistent
 but decreased left lower lobe opacity.  Although superimposed infection is
 difficult to exclude, the appearance could be explained by atelectasis,
 scarring, potentially with residual loculated effusion.
