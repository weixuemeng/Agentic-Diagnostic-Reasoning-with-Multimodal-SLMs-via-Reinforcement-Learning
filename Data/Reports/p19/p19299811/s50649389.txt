                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chronic kidney disease and shortness of breath.
 Evaluate for heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased heterogeneous opacification
 seen in the mid and lower right lung fields consistent with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema versus aspiration.  Small right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacification of the right mid and lower lung
 fields is concerning for asymmetric pulmonary edema versus aspiration.
