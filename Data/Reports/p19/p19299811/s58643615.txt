 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:49 PM
  
  1. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
  2. Focal opacity overlying the peripheral right hemithorax may relate to
  overlying soft tissue, however a developing consolidation, focal pulmonary
  edema, versus pulmonary infarction, given location and appearance, are
  additional considerations.  Recommend attention on followup imaging.
  3. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD, CHF, COPD with new cough and pleuritic
 chest pain.  // Please eval for PNA vs. pulmonary edema      Please eval for
 PNA vs. pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 5 cm long Peripheral mass like opacity in the right upper hemi thorax with a
 convex medial margin, could be infection, infarction, or pleural mass or fluid
 collection.  Conventional chest radiographs might be helpful in making the
 distinction, but CT or CTA scanning may prove necessary
 
 Mild interstitial edema and vascular congestion are evident in the left Lung
 and is more severe in the right lung.  Even greater opacification in the right
 lung base is a pattern of previous episodes of edema in this patient and need
 not therefore be due to concurrent pneumonia, even though the upper lung
 process could be infectious.  Heart size is normal.  Dependent pleural
 effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Suggest PA lateral and oblique conventional chest
 radiographs at least to determine whether the right chest lesion is a pleural
 fluid loculation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 10:15 AM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
