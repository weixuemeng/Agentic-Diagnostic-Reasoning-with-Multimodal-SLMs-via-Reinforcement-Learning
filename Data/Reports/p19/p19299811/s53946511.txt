                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure and dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is a cardiomegaly which is stable.  There is crowding of the pulmonary
 vascular markings at the lung bases consistent with atelectasis and poor
 inspiratory effort.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen layering on
 the lateral view.  There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or
 pneumothoraces.  Overall, allowing for differences in technique, there has
 been no significant change.
