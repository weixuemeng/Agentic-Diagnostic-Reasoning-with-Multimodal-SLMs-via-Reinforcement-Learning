                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Bilateral airspace opacities
 obscure both hemidiaphragms.  The hila are indistinct bilaterally, but more
 enlarged on the right.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  There is a
 partial collapse of the left lower lobe.  Mild cardiomegaly may be slightly
 worse compared with ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities are partially due to CHF.  The assymetric hilar
 enlargement suggests that there may be an additional component of infection
 and reactive adenopathy on the right.
