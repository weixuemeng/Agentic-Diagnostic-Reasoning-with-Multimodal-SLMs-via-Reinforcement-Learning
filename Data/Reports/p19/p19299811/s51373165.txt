                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o chron's, cdiff, now sudden onset severe
 abdominal pain, s/p ileocecectomy c/b anastomosis dehiscence, end ileostomy 
 // please obtain upright CXR include diaphragm to evaluate for free air under
 diaphragm
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam does not appear to be performed in a fully upright position based on
 partial layering of bilateral pleural effusions.  With this limitation in
 mind, no free intraperitoneal air is identified.  Given this limitation,
 either an upright chest radiograph for left lateral decubitus abdominal
 radiograph would be suggested to more fully exclude the possibility of free
 air.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving asymmetrical pulmonary edema
 and apparent increase in size of bilateral effusions, with no other relevant
 changes since recent study.
