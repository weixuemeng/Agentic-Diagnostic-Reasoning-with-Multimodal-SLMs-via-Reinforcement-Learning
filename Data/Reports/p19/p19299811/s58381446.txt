                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p exlap  // confirm position CVL and ETT     
 confirm position CVL and ETT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in
 place with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube
 extends to the stomach, with the side port close to the esophagogastric
 junction.  The tube should be pushed forward about 5-10 cm for better
 positioning.
 The left IJ catheter extends to the brachiocephalic vein close to the junction
 with the superior vena cava.  Dialysis catheter is unchanged.  Basilar
 opacification at the left is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural fluid.
