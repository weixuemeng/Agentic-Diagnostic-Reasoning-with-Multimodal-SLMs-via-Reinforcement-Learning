 Left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Right central
 venous line tip terminates in the right atrium.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable.  There is interval improvement of the right perihilar and lower
 lobe opacities but persistence of the left lower lobe opacity, finding most
 likely consistent with resolution of interstitial edema but persistent left
 basal opacity concerning for potential infection.  No interval increase in
 pleural effusion demonstrated.  No development of pneumothorax is seen.
