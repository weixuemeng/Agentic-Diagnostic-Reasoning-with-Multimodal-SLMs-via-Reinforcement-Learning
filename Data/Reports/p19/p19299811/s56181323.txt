                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two days of chills, muscle aches, and wheezing.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  CT of the chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 four exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  On one of the
 lateral views, there is a small wedge-shaped opacity overlying the heart in
 the distribution of the right middle lobe.  This could represent focal
 atelectasis, although a small right middle lobe pneumonia is difficult to
 completely exclude.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Previously seen small bilateral pleural
 effusions have essentially resolved in the interval. The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and allowing for technique,
 unchanged from prior exams.  Degenerative changes are noted in the lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small wedge-shaped opacity in the right middle lobe, on one view only, may
 represent focal atelectasis or pneumonia or artifact.
 2.  Unchanged cardiomegaly.
