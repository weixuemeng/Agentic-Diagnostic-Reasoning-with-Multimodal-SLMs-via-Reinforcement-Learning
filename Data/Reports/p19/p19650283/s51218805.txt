                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:45.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating approximately 1.8
 cm from the carina, and should be withdrawn.  Orogastric tube is seen with tip
 appearing to terminate in the distal esophagus, and should be advanced for
 optimal positioning.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  The heart size remains moderately enlarged.  There
 is unchanged mediastinal widening, likely related to low lung volumes.  There
 is worsening pulmonary edema, now mild to moderate in extent with probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Focal opacity is seen within the periphery
 of the right mid-to-upper lung field, could reflect an infectious process.  No
 pneumothorax is clearly evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low-lying endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 1.8 cm from the
 carina, and should be withdrawn slightly.
 2.  Orogastric tube tip appears to terminate within the distal esophagus and
 should be advanced.
 3.  Interval worsening of mild to moderate pulmonary edema with probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Continued opacification within the peripheral
 right upper-to-mid lung field.
