                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Adbominal distension and pain.  Rule out obstruction.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is enlarged.  Mediastinal widening may be due to low lung volumes. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema.  There are probable bilateral small pleural
 effusions.  Focal opacity in the right upper and mid lung fields and in both
 lung bases are non-specific but could reflect areas of infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. Probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  
 
 2. Focal opacities in the right upper and mid lung fields and lung bases are
 non-specifically, possibly reflecting areas of infection. Short interval
 radiographic follow up is recommended after treatment to document resolution.
