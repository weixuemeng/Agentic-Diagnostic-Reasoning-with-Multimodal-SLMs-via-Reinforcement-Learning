 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild tortuosity along the
 descending aorta.  Streaky left infrahilar opacities are most suggestive of
 minor atelectasis or bronchopneumonia in the lingula.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
