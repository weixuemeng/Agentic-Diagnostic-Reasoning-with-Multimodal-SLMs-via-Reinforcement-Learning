                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of renal transplant now with
 abdominal pain, nausea, emesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, and crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable, possibly with mild
 cardiomegaly.  Left lower lung opacity may represent atelectasis, however
 pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis post be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Right cardiophrenic angle opacity likely reflects crowding
 of normal bronchovascular structures.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Difficult to
 exclude a small left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Left lung opacity may represent atelectasis versus
 pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Possible small left pleural effusion.
