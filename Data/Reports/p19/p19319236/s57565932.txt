                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ___'s, now with seizures status post
 tumor resection/radiation, intubated, confirm ET position.
 
 CHEST PORTABLE:  No prior studies are available for comparison.  The film is
 noted.  An ET tube is identified 2.8 cm from the carina and is in adequate
 position.  There is cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum is difficult to evaluate. 
 It appears widened, which may be due to positioning.  The pulmonary
 vasculature appears somewhat crowded likely due to poor inspiratory effort and
 there are no definite pleural effusions.  An NG tube is identified and is seen
 with its sidehole in the stomach, although the tip is not visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube in adequate position.
 
 2.  Widening of the mediastinum is likely due to positioning.  A repeat AP and
 lateral chest radiograph is recommended once the patient has recovered from
 the acute process to exclude underlying pathology such as lymphadenopathy.
