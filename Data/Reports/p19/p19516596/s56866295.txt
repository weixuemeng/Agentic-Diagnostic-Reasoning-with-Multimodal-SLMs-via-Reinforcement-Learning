 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of CML, epigastric pain, decreased breath sounds at the
 right lung base, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  A minimal left pleural effusion might have occurred in the interval. 
 Effusion is limited to the dorsal aspects of the costophrenic sinus.  The
 heart continues to be borderline in diameter, but there is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
