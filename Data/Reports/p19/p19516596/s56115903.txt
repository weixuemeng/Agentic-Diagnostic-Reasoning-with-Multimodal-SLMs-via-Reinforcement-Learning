                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of chronic myelocytic
 leukemia.  Progressive shortness of breath, evaluate for pleural effusion or
 other acute causes.  On Sprycel.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size is enlarged.  No typical
 configurational abnormality is present, however, as mentioned on the previous
 examination, the cardiac enlargement is probably related to diffuse
 cardiomegaly and possibly enhanced by some pericardial effusion.
 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free.  No new acute infiltrates can be identified.  In
 comparison with the next preceding study of ___, the findings are
 stable.  Thus, no evidence of new acute infiltrates or pleural effusions in
 this patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia.
