                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Significant cough, fever and aching.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is a small left pleural effusion.  A density seen obscuring
 the left hemidiaphragm on the lateral view may represent segmental atelectasis
 or fluid is seen within the fissure.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours and hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present history injury to right ventricle. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Opacity within the left lower lobe may reflect fluid in the
 fissure from a small left pleural effusion versus segmental atelectasis or
 consolidation.  Further clarification with oblique views is recommended.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 13:17  on ___ by telephone at the time of discovery.
