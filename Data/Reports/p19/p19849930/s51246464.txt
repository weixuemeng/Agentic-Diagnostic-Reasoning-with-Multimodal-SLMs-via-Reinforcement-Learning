                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New pacemaker, for lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is a dual-channel pacemaker
 in place with the leads in the region of the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications most
 likely reflect atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
