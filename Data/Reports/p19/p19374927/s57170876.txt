                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left hemidiaphragm is somewhat obscured, which may be due to
 overlying body habitus, although atelectasis or small pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  The right lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to
 overlying soft tissue, however, a small pleural effusion is not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would likely be helpful for further evaluation
 if patient able.
