 FINDINGS:
 
 There is pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased opacity at the right lung
 base may relate to prominent vascular structures with concern for underlying
 consolidation possibly due to pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
