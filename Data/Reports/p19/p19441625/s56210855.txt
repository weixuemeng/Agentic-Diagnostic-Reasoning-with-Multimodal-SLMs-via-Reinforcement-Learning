 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  An influenza, status post pneumonia, evaluation for resolution of
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing parenchymal
 opacities, terminating at the right lung bases, have almost completely
 resolved.  Only subtle peribronchial scars are seen on today's image.  There
 is no evidence of secondary changes such as adenopathy or pleural effusion. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
