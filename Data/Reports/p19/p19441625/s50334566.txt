                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with productive cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacity at the lung bases is most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  There is, however, somewhat patchy but still linear opacity in
 the right upper lung on the frontal exam, not clearly located on the lateral. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy but somewhat linear opacity in the right upper lung, this
 could be due to atelectasis; however, early, developing infiltrate is also
 possible.  Clinical correlation suggested.
