                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonias, febrile and cough for several days.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  When compared to the prior chest x-ray, there is a
 slight increase in lung markings to the right middle lobe on the PA chest,
 though this is not confirmed on the lateral.  This may be due to overlying
 breast soft tissue, but in view of the patient's history, this could represent
 early evidence of a right middle lobe pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the heart and
 mediastinum are normal and the lung fields are clear.
