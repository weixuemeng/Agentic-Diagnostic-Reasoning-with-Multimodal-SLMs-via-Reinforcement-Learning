  decrease in size of the left pleural effusion. Interval placement of an
  esophageal catheter with tip coursing below the diaphragm and out of view. No
  pneumothorax detected. Findings and recommendations discussed with ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left-sided thoracocentesis, evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects just several millimeters
 above the carina, the tube should be pulled back by approximately 2 cm to
 avoid intubation of the right main bronchus.  The right venous introduction
 sheath has been removed.  Newly placed Swan-Ganz catheter over a right-sided
 access.  The tip of the catheter projects over the outflow tract of the right
 ventricle.
 
 Normal course of the nasogastric tube.  Newly placed Swan-Ganz catheter in the
 left pleural cavity.  The pre-existing pleural effusion has substantially
 decreased.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
