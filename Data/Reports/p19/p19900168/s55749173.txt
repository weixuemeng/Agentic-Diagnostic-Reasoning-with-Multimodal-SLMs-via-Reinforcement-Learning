                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new line placement, evaluate
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study dated ___.  In the interval, the
 position of the ET has been adjusted by withdrawing it so it is now located
 some 4 cm above the level of the carina.  A right-sided subclavian approach
 Swan-Ganz catheter in unchanged position now clearly reaching central portion
 of the pulmonary artery.  A new left-sided internal jugular approach central
 venous line has been placed reaching the right-sided SVC and terminating at
 the level of the carina.  This indicates the mid position of the SVC.
 
 No pneumothorax has developed.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are present. 
 Mild haze over the right-sided diaphragmatic contour suggests possible mild
 increase of pleural effusion at that side.  The left-sided inferior pleural
 space is drained by a pigtail catheter and remains free.
