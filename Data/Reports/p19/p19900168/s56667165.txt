                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left internal jugular line tip is at the mid portion of SVC.  The
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the right ventricle outflow tract.  Patient was
 extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the NG tube.  The heart
 size is unchanged.  The appearance of the mediastinum demonstrates new bulging
 along the left upper mediastinum that might be consistent with slightly
 expanding hematoma, and attention to this area is recommended.  There is
 interval improvement of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral basal effusions and
 bibasal consolidations are still present.
