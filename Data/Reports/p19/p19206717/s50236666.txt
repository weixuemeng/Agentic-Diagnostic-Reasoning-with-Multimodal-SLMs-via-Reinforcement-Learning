 Any interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 remain unchanged.  There is increasing opacification at the left base, which
 could reflect some worsening pleural effusion and atelectatic changes. Less
 prominent changes are seen on the right.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 it would be difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed
 consolidation.
