                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with picc, no blood return. Thx  // PICC placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chronic interstitial abnormality and bronchiectasis re- demonstrated.  There
 is persistent blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles.  Slight increase
 in opacity at the left mid lung and perihilar regions may be due to
 superimposed pulmonary edema versus infection.  On the lateral view, there is
 a a 1.9 x 1.9 cm rounded opacity posteriorly overlying the anterior mid
 thoracic spine, not clearly identified on chest CT from ___. 
 Recommend follow-up chest CT for further assessment as pulmonary nodule is not
 excluded.  Old left-sided rib deformity re- demonstrated.
