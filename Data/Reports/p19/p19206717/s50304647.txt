                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD exacerbation, impending respiratory
 failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT trachea ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged with enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, better assessed on the
 previous CT, compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is upper
 zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema.  Chronic
 interstitial opacities are again noted predominantly along the periphery and
 lung bases with bronchiectasis also noted in the lower lobes.  Patchy
 ill-defined opacities are re- demonstrated in both lower lung fields as well
 as within the upper lobes bilaterally, more so on the right.  Overall, the
 findings within the left lung base and left upper lobe appear minimally
 improved, with the opacities in the right lung base perhaps slightly worse. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Remote left-sided rib rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy ill-defined opacities within both upper lobes, more so on the right, as
 well as within both lung bases, findings concerning for superimposed infection
 on a background of chronic interstitial abnormality and bronchiectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
