                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension, cough and an abnormal exam,
 evaluate for infiltrate.  Additional clinical history from the medical record
 includes that this is a ___-year-old female with history of HIV and hepatitis
 C, found with altered mental status, with suspicion for medication ingestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is airspace opacity in the right upper lobe, and there is
 linear opacity seen in the bilateral lower lungs, likely reflecting a
 combination of atelectasis and airspace consolidation.  Right upper lobe
 nodularity raises the possibility of mycetoma. The heart size is normal, the
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe airspace opacity, with bilatearl atelectasis. 
 Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia in this immunosuppressed
 patient.  Alternatively, aspiration could have this appearance. Follow up is
 recommended to exclude developing mycetoma.
 
 Findings of pneumonia versus aspiration were discussed with Dr. ___ at
 11:30 a.m.
