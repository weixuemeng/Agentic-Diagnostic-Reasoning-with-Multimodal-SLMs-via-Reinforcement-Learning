                                 FINAL REPORT

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, and chest
 radiograph and chest CT on ___.
 
 Patient has chronic widespread mild to moderate bronchiectasis and prior CT
 scans have documented recurrence of small areas of peribronchial inflammation,
 presumably related to bronchiectasis.  There is no pneumonia on today's study,
 but bronchial wall thickening is more pronounced than it was on chest
 radiographs ___, the same day as the chest CT.  Signs and symptoms may

 pneumonia.
