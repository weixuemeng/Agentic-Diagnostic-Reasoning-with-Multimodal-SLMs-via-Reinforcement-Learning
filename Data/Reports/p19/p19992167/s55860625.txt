                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimally increased interstitial markings in the retrocardiac area most likely
 represent atelectatic changes, however early infectious process is possible in
 the proper clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  The descending aorta is tortuous.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  Chronic appearing
 right-sided rib deformities likely reflect remote fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased interstitial markings in the left lung base likely
 represent atelectasis, however no early infectious process is possible in the
 proper clinical setting.
