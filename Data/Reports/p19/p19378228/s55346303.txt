 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction.  The heart appears mildly enlarged which may reflect
 cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There
 is prominent right paratracheal and hilar soft tissue which may be vascular in
 etiology but raises the possibility of lymphadenopathy.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.
