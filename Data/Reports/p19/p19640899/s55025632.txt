                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 2. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, reflective of a mildly tortuous
 thoracic aorta.  An left chest cardiac device is unchanged in orientation. 
 The left chest Port-A-Cath has been removed since prior radiograph.  Diffuse
 prominence of the pulmonary interstitium is most conspicuous in the lower
 lobes, similar appearance to prior exams, and may relate to volume overload. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is stable from multiple prior exams.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  There is no focal consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable prominence of the pulmonary interstitium likely relates to volume
 overload, similar appearance to prior exams.  No definite focal consolidation.
