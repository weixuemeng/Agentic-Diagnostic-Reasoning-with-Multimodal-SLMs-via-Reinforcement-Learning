                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, infected hip, worsening cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  SLIGHTLY ROTATED POSITIONING.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is increased retrocardiac density, with air
 bronchograms and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, new compared with
 ___, concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia. Patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region is unchanged compared with ___.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring and diffusely increased
 interstitial markings.  Stable cardiomegaly. Possible small right effusion and
 minimal atelectasis at right base.
  
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonic infiltrate. 
 If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help to better demonstrate this.
 
 2.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings.  This most likely reflects CHF,
 though the differential could include other interstitial processes.
 
 3.  Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, unchanged.
 
 Findings discussed with covering house officer Dr. ___ at the
