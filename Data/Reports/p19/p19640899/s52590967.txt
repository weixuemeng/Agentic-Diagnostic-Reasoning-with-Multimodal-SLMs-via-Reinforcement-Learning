                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion with
 interval decrease in severity of pulmonary edema with residual mild
 interstitial edema remaining.  Within the periphery of the right upper lobe,
 at the level of the sixth posterior rib level is a poorly-defined 7-mm
 diameter nodular opacity which in retrospect is present on older study of ___.  Note is also made of small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving pulmonary edema.
 2.  7 mm peripheral right upper lobe nodular opacity, for which chest CT is
 recommended in order to differentiate a benign nodule from a slowly growing
 lung adenocarcinoma.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned with this recommendation on ___ at
 10:45 a.m. at time of discovery.
