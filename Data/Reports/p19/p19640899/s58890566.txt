                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph is underpenetrated secondary to the patient's body
 habitus.  Allowing for this limitation, the lungs are well expanded.  There
 are slightly increased interstitial opacities compared with prior chest
 radiographs, but no focal parenchymal opacity.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. Costophrenic angles are partially obscured potentially from
 overlying soft tissue/technique versus small effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A left-sided PICC line ends in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema in the setting of moderate cardiomegaly. 
 No evidence of pneumonia. PA and lateral views may offer additional detail if
 desired.
