                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours stable.  There
 is persistent mild perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness compatible
 with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 milldy increased in size compared to the previous exam.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities most likely reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 slightly increased in size compared to the previous exam.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be completely
 excluded.
