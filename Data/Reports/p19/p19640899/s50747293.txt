                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of shortness-of-breath.  Please evaluate for CHF.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Persistent mild to moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists, with an interval increase in the severity of pulmonary edema.  There
 is also moderate interstitial edema.  Again noted, at the periphery of the
 right upper lobe, at the level of the ___ posterior rib, there is a 8 mm
 nodular opacity, overall unchanged compared to the prior exam.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are persistent.  There is a right-sided central
 line which terminates in the right atrium.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Overall, interval increase in the moderate to severe diffuse pulmonary
 edema compared to the prior exam.  
 
 2. 8-mm lung nodule in the right upper lobe is unchanged compared to the prior
 exam, however a chest CT is recommended to differentiate a benign nodule from
 a slowly growing lung adenocarcinoma.
