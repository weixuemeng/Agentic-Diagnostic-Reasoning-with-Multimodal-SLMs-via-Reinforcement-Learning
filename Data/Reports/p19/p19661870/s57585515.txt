                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new hypoxia and dyspnea.  Question
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates intact median
 sternotomy wires.  New irregular opacification at both lung bases could be
 pneumonia due to virus or mycoplasma infection or aspiration. Vertically
 oriented lucency projecting to the left of the lower trachea could be air in a
 thick walled esophagus; consider esophagitis or other infiltrative abnormality
 thickening the esophageal wall.  The heart is normal size and there is no
 vascular congestion or appreciable pleural effusion to point to cardiac
 decompensation.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably pneumonia, due to aspiration or atypical pathogen.
 Possible esophageal abnormality should be evaluated at least clinically, if
 not with a contrast swallow.
 
 atyp pna or aspiration
