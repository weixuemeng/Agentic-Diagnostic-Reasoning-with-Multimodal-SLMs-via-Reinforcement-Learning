                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and fever,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Along the left heart border is subtle
 density which is most compatible with slightly prominent bronchovasculature,
 though the possibility of a very early or partially resolving pneumonia is
 impossible to exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia, though very subtle opacity in the
 left lower lung could represent a minimal consolidation in the correct
 clinical setting.
