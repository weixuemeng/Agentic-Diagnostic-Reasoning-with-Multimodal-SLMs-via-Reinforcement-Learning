                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Overdose, nonresponsive.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the gastric antrum.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  Minimal left basiliar opacification is probably due to minor
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Endotracheal tube at about 5.5 cm
 above the carina; it could be advanced by about 2 cm for more optimal
 positioning if clinically indicated.
 
 2.  Minimal left basilar opacification, probably compatible with atelectasis.
