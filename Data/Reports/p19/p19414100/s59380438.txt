                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for hyperinflation or sternal
 abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs, which
 could be within normal limits or related to chronic pulmonary disease.  No
 evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  The sternum
 is not optimally seen on this study, which shows no evidence of abnormality.
