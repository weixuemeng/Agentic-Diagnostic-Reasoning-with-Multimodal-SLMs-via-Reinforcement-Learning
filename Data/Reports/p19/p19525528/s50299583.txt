 of PTX, other chest tube complication
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at at 18:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar pleural catheter remains in place.  Patchy opacities at both
 bases likely reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A linear opacity at the right apex is
 felt to be related to something external to the patient as it crosses outside
 of the hemithorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Crowding of the vasculature in the setting of low lung
 volumes.
