                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity may reflect a combination of pleural effusion,
 atelectasis, and probable concurrent pneumonia given the provided history of
 sepsis. The left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax or large effusion. The heart
 is normal in size.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Distended air-filled loops
 of bowel in the right upper quadrant are non-specific.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right pleural effusion.  Correlate with clinical assessment and consider
 cross sectional imaging and fluid sampling to evaluate etiology if clinically
 indicated.
 2.  Concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded and is certainly
 possible given the provided history of sepsis.
 3.  Non-specific gaseous distension of partially imaged bowel in the right
 upper quadrant.  Correlate with clinical assessment and consider dedicated
 abdominal imaging to further evaluate for acute process, particularly in the
 setting of a right pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlate clinical assessment for etiology of right
 pleural effusion and consider dedicated cross-section chest and abdominal
 imaging to further evaluate as above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:28 AM, 60 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
