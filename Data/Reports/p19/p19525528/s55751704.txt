 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube for empyema  // change from prior 
 change from prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right basilar pigtail pleural catheter remains in place.  There is a
 questionable tiny lucency near the right apex which could reflect a very tiny
 pneumothorax or possibly loculated air or focal pleural fat as no definite
 pleural line is seen extending from this lucency.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  Residual patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Improved aeration at the left base.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in
 patient rotation.
