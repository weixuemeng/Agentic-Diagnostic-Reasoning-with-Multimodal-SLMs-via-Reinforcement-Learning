                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with prolonged coughing with productive sputum
 over the past 3 weeks,  // please evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear without consolidations or effusions. Heart
 size is normal.  There is abnormal prominence of the left hilum. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are otherwise normal. Pleural surfaces
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.  Prominence of the left hilum may
 reflect an asymmetrically large left pulmonary artery and underlying pulmonic
 stenosis or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Recommend correlation with outside
 hospital imaging if available to establish chronicity.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend correlation with outside hospital images further
 evaluation of prominent left hilum.  If no prior imaging is available or if
 new, recommend CT chest for further evaluation.
