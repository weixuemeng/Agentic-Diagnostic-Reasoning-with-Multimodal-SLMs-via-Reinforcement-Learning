                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the Dobbhoff
 tube extends to the distal stomach, then coils back on itself so that the tip
 points to the left, but is still in the distal stomach.  There is still
 substantial opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe.  Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
