                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with myeloma, persistent cough, assess
 for abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No typical configurational abnormality
 is seen.  Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  On the right lung base, there is a
 parenchymal density occupying the cardiophrenic angle on the frontal view and
 projecting into the medial lower segment of the right middle lobe.  An
 additional local parenchymal infiltrate is seen on the left base partially in
 retrocardiac position and located in the posterior segment of the left lower
 lobe on the lateral view.  Pleural spaces are free and thus no evidence of
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  When comparison is
 made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, the
 patient had, at that time, small peripheral parenchymal infiltrates on the
 left base.  The now diagnosed pneumonic infiltrate in the right middle lobe
 did not exist and the parenchymal densities on the left base are larger than
 they were at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal parenchymal infiltrates consistent with acute
 infection.  Followup examination after treatment is recommended.
 
 Referring physician, ___, was paged and reached at 5:15 p.m.
