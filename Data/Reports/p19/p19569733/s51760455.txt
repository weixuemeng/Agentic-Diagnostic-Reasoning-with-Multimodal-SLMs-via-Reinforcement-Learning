                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes limits
 assessment.  Within that limitation no definite focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limits assessment.  Recommend repeat films with
 better inspiration.
