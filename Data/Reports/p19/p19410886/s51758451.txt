                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ?altered mental status, febrile to 102.8  // r/o
 infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day CT abdomen pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supine portable AP view the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  In this patient with a known right diaphragmatic eventration, a
 double density at the right lower lung is reflective of this.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis without large pleural effusion.  Heart size is difficult
 to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable.  No convincing
 signs of overt edema or pneumonia when interpreted in conjunction with
 same-day CT abdomen pelvis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Right hemidiaphragmatic eventration.  No overt signs
 of edema or pneumonia.
