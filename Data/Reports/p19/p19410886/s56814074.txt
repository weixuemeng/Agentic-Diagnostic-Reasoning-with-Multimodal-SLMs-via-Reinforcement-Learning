                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again low lung volumes are seen
 with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  There is no evidence of
 confluent consolidation or effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema is identified. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated due to
 AP technique and low inspiratory volumes.  It is unchanged from prior.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this exam with
 low lung volumes.
