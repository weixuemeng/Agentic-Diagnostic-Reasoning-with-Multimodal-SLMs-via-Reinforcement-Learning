                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion/ altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears at least moderately enlarged but unchanged. Widening
 of the mediastinal contour is likely reflective of the low inspiratory lung
 volumes and is similar to the prior study. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Marked degenerative
 changes are again noted throughout the imaged thoracolumbar spine without a
 definite acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
 Infection however is not completely excluded.
