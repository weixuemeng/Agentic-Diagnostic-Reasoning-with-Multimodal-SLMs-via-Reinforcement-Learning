                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently chest radiographs of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of diaphragms, consistent with
 emphysema. Opacities in the right lung base are consistent with pneumonia.
 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal and mediastinal
 contours, including tortuosity of the aorta, are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung base opacities likely reflect focal scar or atelectasis but FOLLOW
 UP
 PA and lateral CXR is recommended when clinically feasible to exclude
 focal/early pneumonia.
