                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMHx of tobacco use, COPD, AAA, PVD,
 presenting with hypotension, with portable CXR showing right lung base
 opacities.  // Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 01:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflation. Tortuous, calcified thoracic aorta. Heart size within normal. 
 Trace right pleural effusion. The previously demonstrated right lung base
 opacity is slightly less prominent on the current study, likely atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy right base opacity is less conspicuous than prior study, and likely
 represents atelectasis rather than developing pneumonia.
