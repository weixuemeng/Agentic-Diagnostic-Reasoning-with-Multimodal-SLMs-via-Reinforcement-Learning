                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT of the chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Large left chest wall mass
 with rib destruction appears similar compared to the prior radiograph.  No
 definite new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia, but
 standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to more fully
 evaluate the lung bases which are partially obscured by overlying breast
 tissue and left chest wall mass.
