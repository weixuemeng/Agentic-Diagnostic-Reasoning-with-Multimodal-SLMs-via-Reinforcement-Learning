 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:42 PM
  Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter with stable post-operative changes
  otherwise including likely minimal residual pneumopericardium. Retrocardiac
  opacities have increased and are likely representative of atelectasis;
  however, an overlying infection must be excluded in the proper clinical
  setting. Peristant small left pleural effusion and new blunting of the right
  hemidiaphragm suggesting a new small right effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, with
 no visible pneumothorax.  Stable postoperative widening of cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Worsening bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are likely due to
 atelectasis, and are accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions,
 increased on the left and apparently new on the right in the interval.  On the
 left, the pleural effusion is apparently superimposed on pre-existing pleural
 thickening adjacent to numerous healed left rib fractures, a finding present
 since ___.  Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the chest wall. 
 Retrosternal gas is probably related to recent sternotomy procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening bibasilar atelectasis and increasing pleural effusions.
