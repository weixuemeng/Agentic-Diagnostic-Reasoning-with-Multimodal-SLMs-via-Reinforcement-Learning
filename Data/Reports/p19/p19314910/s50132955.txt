 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been hazy opacification at the left lung base compared to
 the right, which may be related to soft tissue attenuation.  No definite focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There is
 a 9-mm calcified nodule in the right lung base, which likely represents a
 calcified granuloma.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with mild tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  9-mm calcified granuloma in
 the right lung base.
