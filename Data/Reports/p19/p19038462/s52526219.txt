                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:04.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.6 cm from the carina.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases are
 compatible with areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  A 6 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid
 lung field may reflect a calcified granuloma.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is gaseous distention of the stomach.  Widening of the
 right acromioclavicular joint suggests prior type II AC joint separation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Gaseous distension of the stomach.
 4. Evidence of right acromioclavicular joint separation, type II, likely
 chronic.
