                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with HCV and HCC who was noted to be
 hypoxic, pneumonia versus edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 1:31.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 10:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes with interval appearance of patchy bibasilar
 opacities which could reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 although there is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, most likely related
 to the low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
