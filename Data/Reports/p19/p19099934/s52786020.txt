                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, immunosuppressed, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are lower in volume with resultant increase in
 bronchovascular crowding and left greater than right basilar opacities which
 are likely atelectasis, though supervening pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate setting.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 likely artifactual given low lung volumes with normal mediastinal and hilar
 contours, though mild pulmonary edema could produce a similar pattern.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen with satisfactory and unchanged
 position of the Port-A-Cath.
