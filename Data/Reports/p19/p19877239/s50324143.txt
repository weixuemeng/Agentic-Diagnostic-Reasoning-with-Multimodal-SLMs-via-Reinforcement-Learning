                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Squamous cell lung cancer, now with worsening dyspnea and
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new consolidation at the right lung apex with sharp
 margins representing the fissure compatible with right upper lobe collapse. 
 The extreme right lung apex is partially aerated.  Hazy opacification at the
 right lung base likely reflects a small layering pleural effusion.  The left
 lung base shows a small pleural effusion and mild degree of atelectasis, as
 before.  The known right mediastinal mass is not well visualized due to right
 upper lobe collapse.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right upper lobe collapse.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar atelectasis, similar to
 ___.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 1:30 p.m. on ___.
