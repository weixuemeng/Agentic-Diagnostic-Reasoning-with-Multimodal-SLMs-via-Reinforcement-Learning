                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with non-small cell lung cancer status post
 radiation therapy with bilateral pleural effusions and right lobar collapse
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased opacification of the at the right lung
 suggesting complete right lung collapse and opacification of the previously
 noted small aerated portion of the right upper lobe.  The left lung appears
 relatively well aerated. The mediastinum appears shifted to the left despite
 the collapse suggesting a large right pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right lung collapse, now with complete collapse. The
 mediastinum is however shifted to the left suggesting that there is
 substantial right pleural effusion.
