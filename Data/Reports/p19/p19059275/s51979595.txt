                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with apical fluid and air
 collection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior studies obtained a day earlier with the latest one obtained
 at 7:40 p.m. on ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is slight interval increase in the air portion of
 the loculated hydropneumothorax at the right apex, minimal, with otherwise no
 substantial change demonstrated.  Subcutaneous air within the right chest
 wall/axilla appears to be slightly increased since the prior study.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be
 considered.
