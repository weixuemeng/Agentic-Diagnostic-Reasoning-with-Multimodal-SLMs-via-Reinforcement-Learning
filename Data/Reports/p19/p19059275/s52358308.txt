                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post right upper lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Volume loss in the right hemithorax again reflects prior lobectomy.  New right
 apical chest tube is in unchanged position.  There is stable amount of pleural
 fluid and right apical pneumothorax on the right.  Multifocal opacities in the
 right base and right perihilar region may reflect atelectasis.  With the
 exception of small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, the left
 lung remains clear.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged, again shifted to the
 right, reflecting volume loss.  No new opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little change from one day prior.  Persistent right pleural effusion and right
 apical pneumothorax, unchanged.  Small left effusion and associated basal
 atelectasis.
