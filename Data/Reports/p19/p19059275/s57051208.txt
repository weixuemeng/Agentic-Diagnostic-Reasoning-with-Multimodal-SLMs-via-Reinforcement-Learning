 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  From the prior study on the same

 remains in good position terminating in the apex.  The rightward mediastinal
 displacement and the right pneumothorax are unchanged from the prior study. 
 There is no evidence of tension.  There has been minimal worsening of the left
 basilar atelectasis and effusion which obscures the left hemidiaphragmatic
 contour.  The left lung is otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged right pneumothorax since removal of basilar chest tube.  No
 evidence of tension.
 2.  Slight worsening of left basilar atelectasis and small effusion.
