                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and cough as well as leukocytosis. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest redemonstrate marked
 asymmetric aeration of the right lung and architectural distortion related to
 prior right upper lobectomy, with posterior surgical rib defects.  There is
 new hazy opacity involving the right lower lung with extension superiorly. 
 Multiple air-fluid levels are present in the right upper lung in the resection
 bed, suggestive of complex loculated fluid, raising question of empyema.  The
 left lung remains clear.  The visualized portion of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Trace subcutaneous emphysema is
 persistent, likely postoperative residual.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New hazy opacity involving the right lung with numerous air-fluid levels
 superiorly in the region of recent right upper lobectomy.  This could
 represent infection with associated loculated fluid, however CT would be
 prudent to exclude empyema.
 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumothorax.
 3.  Diminishing subcutaneous emphysema.
