 noted.  There has been interval expansion of the right lung with decrease in
 observed right lower zone atelectasis.  There has been a stable shift in the
 mediastinum and heart to the right.   Left lung is emphysematous but otherwise
 unremarkable.  There are post-surgical changes seen in the right lateral ribs
 with interval increase in rib retraction likely secondary to volume loss.

 small basilar pleural effusions.  No evidence of infection or malignancy.
