                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent right middle and lower lobectomies.  Evaluation
 for interval change and evidence of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiographs dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Again seen is a postoperative right-sided
 hydropneumothorax, within normal postoperative appearance.  The patient is
 status post right middle and upper lobectomies with volume loss on the right
 and similar appearance of shift of mediastinal structures.  Relative
 asymmetric appearance of the left and right hemithoraces could be explained by
 paucity of lung parenchyma on the right, though the presence of a superimposed
 infection would be difficult to exclude.  Overall, the appearance of the lung
 parenchyma is not significantly changed from the prior examination.  There is
 likely some atelectasis at the right base.  Surgical clips appear unchanged. 
 The heart size is within normal limits.
