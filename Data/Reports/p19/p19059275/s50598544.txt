                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper and middle lobectomy with an
 apical fluid collection status post drainage.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips in the right hilus and right costophrenic angle compatible
 with the known history of lobectomy.  There has been interval removal of a
 right apical pleural drainage catheter.  A small amount of apical pleural
 fluid persists as well as a small right basal pleural effusion.  There is no
 large pneumothorax.  There is no mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic
 flattening.  The cardiomediastinal contours are minimally shifted to the
 right, likely the expected result of lobectomy.  The left lung is clear. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema persists in the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected right lobectomy postoperative changes.
