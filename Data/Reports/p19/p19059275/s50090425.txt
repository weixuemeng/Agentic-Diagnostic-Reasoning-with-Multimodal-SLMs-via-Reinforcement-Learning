                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper lobe and right middle lobe
 resections with right apical fluid collection.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips in the right hilum and the right costophrenic angle represent
 post-surgical changes from prior upper and middle lobe resections.  The
 remaining right lower lobe is well aerated.  There is a small amount of
 pleural fluid with a locule of gas in the right apex representing a stable
 hydropneumothorax.  There is no mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic flattening
 to suggest tension.  Subcutaneous gas is seen along the right chest wall.  The
 left lung appears unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right apical hydropneumothorax and expected post-lobectomy
 changes.
