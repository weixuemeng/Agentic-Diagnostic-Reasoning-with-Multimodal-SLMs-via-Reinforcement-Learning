                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute onset shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is widespread bilateral airspace opacity, with normal lung
 volumes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, with a probable
 loculated effusion resulting in well defined right lower lobe opacity.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, in this patient with changes of median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, with probable loculated components to
 pleural effusion, although infection is not excluded and followup is
 recommended to exclude pneumonia.
