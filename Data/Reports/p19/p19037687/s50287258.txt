                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RT MCA stroke now fevers  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  In addition, the patient's chin overlies the upper
 mediastinum and left upper lung.  Allowing for this, the patient is status
 post sternotomy.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  There is increased opacity at
 the left lung base, not fully characterized.  This may represent a combination
 of a small amount of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Possible hiatal hernia. 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  The right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film, but no gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at left lung base, with small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  The possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate in this area cannot be
 excluded.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for further
 assessment.
 
 Right lung grossly clear except for atelectasis at right lung base.
 
 Upper zone redistribution without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Possible hiatal hernia.
