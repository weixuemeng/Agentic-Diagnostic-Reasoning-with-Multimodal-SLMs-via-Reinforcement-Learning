 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:13 PM
  Increased left pleural effusion compared to ___ with underlying
  consolidation, which most likely represents atelectasis, partially seen on
  neck CTA today.  Small right pleural effusion.  Mediastinal widening
  consistent with known type A aortic dissection.  Improved interstitial edema.
  No evidence for pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular
  catheter, bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains appear similarly
  positioned.  Additional likely proximal esophageal catheter is of
  indeterminate purpose, possibly a temperature probe, and appears similar.
  Intestinal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view. Improved
  interstitial edema. No evidence for pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided effusion.
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.4 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. 
 Additional tubing overlying the lower mediastinum is present, likely
 mediastinal drains and chest tubes.  A right IJ sheath is present, tip over
 distal SVC.  
 
 There are sternotomy wires and a prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 consistent with recent surgery.  There is vascular plethora and increased
 interstitial markings, consistent with CHF.  Hazy opacity in the left lung
 most likely represents a layering effusion.  Probable left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggests a small right-sided effusion.  Plaque-like density along the right
 hemidiaphragm, better seen on the prior film, could reflect some pleural
 calcification, raising the question of prior asbestos exposure.  Clips at the
 right thoracic inlet and an additional small radiopacity over the trachea at
 the thoracic inlet are again noted, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post mediastinal surgery with expected postoperative changes.
 
 2.  Interstitial edema, large left and possible small right 
 effusions, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation on the left.
 
 3.  No pneumothorax identified.  
 
 4. Compared with ___ at 23:20 p.m., layering effusion on the left is more
 pronounced.  The aortic knob calcifications are less apparent, possibly due to
 differences in positioning.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 5. Possible calcified right base pleural plaques -- is there a history of
 asbestos exposure?
