  There is a significantly increased opacity at the right lung base compared to
  the recent radiograph and abdominal CT from ___. While this may
  represent continual increase in right-sided pleural effusion and adjacent
  atelectasis; an overlying pneumonia would have a similar appearance and must
  be excluded in the proper clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Newly diagnosed HCC, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing small right
 pleural effusion, combined with an area of parenchymal opacity, likely
 reflecting atelectasis, has slightly increased in extent.  No other
 parenchymal changes are seen.  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta persists.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.
