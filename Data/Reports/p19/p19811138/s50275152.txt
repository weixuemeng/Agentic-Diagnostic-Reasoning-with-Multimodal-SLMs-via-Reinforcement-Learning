                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and hypoxia, status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet to the stomach
 and a sidehole marker projects over the distal esophagus.  A right internal
 central jugular venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There
 are probably small-to-moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions.  The
 heart is probably normal in size.  Mild fullness of central pulmonary vessels
 suggests venous hypertension.  Streaky left basilar opacities are probably due
 to minor atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Orogastric tube terminating probably
 in the cardia of the stomach.  Advancing the tube is suggested if better
 seating is desired clinically.  At present, the sidehole marker projects above
 the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
