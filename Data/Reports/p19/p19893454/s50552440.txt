 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:19 PM
  The more radioopaque edge of the ETT appears to end 1.5cm above carina,
  although the other side appears to be appropriately positioned, ending at the
  level of the clavicles. If there is concern for ETT positioning, consider
  repeat radiograph. OGT ends in the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia.  Line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 4:12
 a.m.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 1.7 cm above the carina.  This
 could be pulled back for more optimal placement by 2 cm.  There is a
 nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction.  The heart
 size is within normal limits.  There are bilateral pleural effusions and a
 left retrocardiac opacity and some mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  There
 is also a left-sided central line with the distal tip in the left
 brachiocephalic vein projecting over the aortic knob.  This is unchanged in
 position from the prior study.  No pneumothoraces are present.
