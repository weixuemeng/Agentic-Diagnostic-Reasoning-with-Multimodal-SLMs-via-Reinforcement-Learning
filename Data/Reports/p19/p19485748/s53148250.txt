 eval for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is questionable opacity
 in the right lower lobe as well as in the right upper lung, findings that
 might potentially represent developing infectious process.
 
 Central venous line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.    No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.

 to exclude the possibility of pneumonia which is partially radiographically
 occult would be considered.
