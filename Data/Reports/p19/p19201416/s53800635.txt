                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, new embolic strokes, likely due to carotid
 dissection, decreased aeration at the left lung base, assess cause.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  The left hemidiaphragm maintains its normal rounded
 contour.  There is no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable, though the left
 heart border is poorly assessed.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated left hemidiaphragm likely accounts for exam findings of
 decreased air movement at the left lung base.
