                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluation of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 substantially increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  Currently, there is
 no evidence of parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Known calcified pleural plaques and unchanged calcified
 nodules in both upper lobes, left more than right.  As indicated in the
 previous reports, CT would be helpful, given the fact that the nodules were
 not all present on the previous exam from ___.
