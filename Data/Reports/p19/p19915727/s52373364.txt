                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of AML now with left lower chest / upper abdominal pain,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are symmetrically well-expanded and well aerated without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A faint nodule projecting
 over the left mid lung zone corresponds to an abnormality seen on the prior
 chest CT.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardio mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Faint nodule projecting over the left mid lung zone corresponds to a
 pulmonary nodule seen on the prior chest CT possibly representing
 atypical/fungal infection in the setting of neutropenia.
