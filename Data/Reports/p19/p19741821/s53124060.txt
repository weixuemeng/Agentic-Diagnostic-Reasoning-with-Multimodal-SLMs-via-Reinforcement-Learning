                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dementia and ALS with failure to thrive and worsening dysphagia,
 assess for pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low in volume but are clear aside from incompletely
 evaluated faint left basal opacity with subtle obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Calcified granuloma or lymph node is seen in the right apex. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size
 with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal left basilar opacification could reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Further assessment by PA and lateral
 radiographs is recommended when clinically feasible.
