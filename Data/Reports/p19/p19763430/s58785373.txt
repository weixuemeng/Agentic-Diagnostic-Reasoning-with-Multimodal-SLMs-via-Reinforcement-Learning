 FINDINGS:  Dobhoff tube tip is still at the thoracoabdominal junction.  The
 Dobbhoff tube curls into the stomach with the tip is still at the
 thoracoabdominal junction.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is present.  Again seen is the leftward mass effect on the
 trachea and right paratracheal opacity caused by the patient's known thyroid
 goiter.  Bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis.
