                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive sputum and low temperature, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Areas of patchy opacification are seen at the bases.  Although this most
 likely represents atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting the
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Substantial displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left is again
 seen.
