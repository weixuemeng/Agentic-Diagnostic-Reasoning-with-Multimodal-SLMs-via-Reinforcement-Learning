                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dysphagia, failure to thrive
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Right hemidiaphragm is
 mildly elevated.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A cluster of multiple high-density material, each measuring up
 to 13 mm, projecting over the right mid abdomen posteriorly may reflect
 retained contrast within colonic diverticula.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures with a compression deformity of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.  Deformity of the midshaft of
 the left clavicle may reflect a remote fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Age indeterminate compression fracture at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
