                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chills for a week.  Known displaced cervical spine hardware and
 new neurological symptoms.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hazy opacification at the left base, which is likely
 atelectasis, although underlying infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Anterior cervical spinal fusion hardware is present, although only
 partially evaluated on these images.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Hazy opacification at the left base is likely atelecatasis, although an
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
