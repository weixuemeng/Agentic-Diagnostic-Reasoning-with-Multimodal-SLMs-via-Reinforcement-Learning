                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:44 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure.  Evaluate lines and
 tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 1:43 a.m.
 
 Endotracheal tube, in standard placement, since the chin is flexed.  Right
 subclavian line has been repositioned, ends in the right atrium, and would
 need to be withdrawn approximately 4 cm to reposition it low in the SVC, if
 desired.  
 
 Borderline cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are exaggerated
 by exceedingly low lung volumes and non-erect positioning.  Lungs are grossly
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
