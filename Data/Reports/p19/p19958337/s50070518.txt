                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:37 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with massive hemorrhage.  New right subclavian
 line.  Question lung infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Right subclavian line heads up into the neck and out of view, anatomic
 localization impossible on this single frontal projection.  There is no
 evidence of mediastinal or intrathoracic bleeding associated with this line
 placement, nor pneumothorax.  Lungs are extremely low in volume, with
 relatively mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Heart size top normal.  No pulmonary
 edema.
