 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  The aorta is tortuous.

 minimal linear scar or atelectasis at the extreme bases.  Lung volumes appear
 increased.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominent central pulmonary vascularity suggesting possible pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.
 
 2.  No acute pulmonary abnormality.
