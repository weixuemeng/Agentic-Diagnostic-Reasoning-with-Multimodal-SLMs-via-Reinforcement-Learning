                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CABG, who presents for pre-discharge evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable compared to the prior exam.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous, and mild widening of the mediastinum is likely
 post-operative.  There appears to be interval increase in a small left-sided
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  There has been interval
 improvement in the mild pulmonary edema.  The median sternotomy wires appear
 to be intact without evidence of fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in small left pleural effusion with
 adjacent opacity likely secondary to atelectasis.
