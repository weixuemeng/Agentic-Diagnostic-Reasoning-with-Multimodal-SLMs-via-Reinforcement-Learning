                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The visualized lung fields are clear of any focal consolidation,
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax, although streaky opacity in the lingula
 suggests very minor atelectasis.  The heart is at the upper limit of normal in
 size.  The aorta is moderately unfolded.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
