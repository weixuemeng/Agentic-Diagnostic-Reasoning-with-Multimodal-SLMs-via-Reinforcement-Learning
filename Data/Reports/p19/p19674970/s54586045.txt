                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with end-stage renal disease, pre kidney transplant
 evaluation.  Rule out abnormality.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and lung volume loss is seen both on the PA and lateral
 radiographs.  Right lung basilar atelectasis is seen with right pleural
 effusion.  Left lower lung volume loss is seen with triangular opacity
 overlying the posterior left lung base.  This opacity may represent pneumonia
 versus chronic infectious change.  No pulmonary edema is noted, and the
 cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is bibasalir lung volume loss.  The right-side has an associated pleural
 effusion.  The left lung base has a posterior triangular opacity which may
 represent a pneumonia versus chronic infectious change.
