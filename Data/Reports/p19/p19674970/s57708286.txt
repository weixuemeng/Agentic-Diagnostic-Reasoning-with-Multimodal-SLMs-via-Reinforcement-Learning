                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___, 1:11 A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath and pulmonary congestion.  Chronic
 kidney disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 5:06 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes have improved since ___.  The mild pulmonary edema has
 decreased.  Residual opacification at the lung base could be persistent edema
 and atelectasis, but should be followed to exclude developing pneumonia.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The central veins are not dilated, and therefore
 volume overload is probably not present.  No pneumothorax.
