                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain leukemia crisis.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable from ___. 
 Transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the standard position in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged as
 before.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side are consistent with
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of CHF or pneumothorax.  The left lateral
 CP angle is partially obscured by the pacer.
 
 Opacities in right lower lobe are likely atelectasis but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropiate clinical setting.
