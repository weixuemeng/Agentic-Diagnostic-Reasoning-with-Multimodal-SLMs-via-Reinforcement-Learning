                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 shortly below the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube has been placed, but it terminates only slightly below the
 left hemidiaphragm, and its sidehole projects along the distal esophagus.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation and placement of orogastric tube.  The
 endotracheal tube could be advanced slightly for more optimal positioning if
 clinically indicated.  Advancing the orogastric tube by approximately 12 cm is
 suggested if placement of the sidehole below the hemidiaphragm is desired and
 to gain better purchase.  
 
 2.  No evidence of acute disease.
