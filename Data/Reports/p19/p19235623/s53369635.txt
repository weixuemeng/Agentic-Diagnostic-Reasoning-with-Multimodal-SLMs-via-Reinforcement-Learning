                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Bilateral atelectasis larger on the
 left side have increased.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Of note opacities in the lower lobes
 are likely atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
