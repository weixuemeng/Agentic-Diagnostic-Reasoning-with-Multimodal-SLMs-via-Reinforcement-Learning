                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  RML collapse status post bronch, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  Continued volume loss in the right middle lobe. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Lower lung volumes but otherwise little change.
