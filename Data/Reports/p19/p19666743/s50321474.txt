                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Two days earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC line has been retracted somewhat and terminates
 in the mid portion of the superior vena cava.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, as before.  There is a suggestion of upper zone re-distribution of
 pulmonary vascularity, which suggests pulmonary venous hypertension, but
 congestive heart failure has largely resolved.  A developing opacity is
 suspected in the right lower lung, however, but not optimally evaluated with
 portable technique.  Streaky left basilar opacity probably is probably
 compatible with minor atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near resolution of pulmonary edema.  Possible developing opacity
 at the right lung base.  Short-term followup radiographs with standard PA and
 lateral technique, if possible, may be helpful to assess for whether it may
 represent a focus of infection rather than atelectasis.
