                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with severe right upper quadrant pain s/p being
 kicked while on the ground in soccer  // concern for injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day CT abdomen and pelvis.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate clear lungs bilaterally.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low exaggerating size of the heart which is otherwise
 normal in size.  Hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  There is no air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Air-filled loop of bowel is noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
