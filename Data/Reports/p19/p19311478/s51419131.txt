                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  There is mild
 prominence of interstitial markings suggesting mild pulmonary edema. 
 Otherwise, the remainder of the lungs are clear.  The aorta appears stably
 tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
 likely due to prominent epicardial fat pad.  No acute fractures are
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal increase in interstitial markings may represent minimal pulmonary
 edema.
