                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hemoptysis, fever, s/p bronch 1 week prior
 // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously noted left lung base opacity has substantially improved, likely
 representing resolving post-procedure hemorrhage.  No new areas of
 consolidation are identified.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. 
 Right port-a-cath terminates at the lower SVC.  Endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement of left lung base opacity, possibly representing
 resolving hemorrhage. Interval improvement and now new opacity due to
 underlying infection or new hemorrhage, is not excluded.
