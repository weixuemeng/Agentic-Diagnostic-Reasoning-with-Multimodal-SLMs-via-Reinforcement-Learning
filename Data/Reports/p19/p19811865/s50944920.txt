                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ HTN, HL, DM2 and new dx of Hodgkin's lymphoma who
 underwent attempted left port-a-cath placement ___ c/b subclavian artery
 injury s/p cutdown, removal of port-a-cath   closure  // Fever work up.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the region of the
 proximal right atrium, just below the expected level of the cavoatrial
 junction. There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the right mid and both lower lungs
 may reflect atelectasis and or scarring but are not fully characterized on
 this portable exam. Initial further evaluation with standard PA and lateral
 radiographs is suggested, particularly to better evaluate the patchy right
 perihilar opacity.
