                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pre-operative evaluation of the chest prior to organ donation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs during this admission dating
 back to ___, most recently performed on ___ at
 20:31 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right subclavian central venous catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter,
 endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left chest tube are unchanged in
 position.  There is persistent retrocardiac and left basilar opacification
 with deep sulcus sign on the left suggesting a combination of atelectasis and
 pneumothorax, although superimposed infection is not excluded.  A small left
 apical pneumothorax is also present.  Multiple rib fractures are
 re-demonstrated. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left apical and basilar pneumothoraces with probable left basilar
 atelectasis.
