 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Brain death, evaluation for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been pulled back.  The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
 position.
 
 The known rib fractures are redemonstrated.  In addition, there is a deep
 sulcus sign, suggestive of a supine pneumothorax.
 
 No parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  Mild atelectasis at both the
 left and the right lung bases.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
