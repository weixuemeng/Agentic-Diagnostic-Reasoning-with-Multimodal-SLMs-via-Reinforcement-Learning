                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:45 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory distress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two frontal views of the chest show new mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Interval increase in mediastinal caliber therefore is
 probably due to distention of mediastinal veins.  Heart size is slightly
 larger but still within normal range.  Pleural effusions are minimal, if any. 
 No focal pulmonary abnormality.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard
 placement and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
