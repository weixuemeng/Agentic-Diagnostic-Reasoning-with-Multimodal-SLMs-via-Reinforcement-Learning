                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest pain, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest on the same
 day.  Peripheral wedge-like opacity at the right base is most consistent with
 infarct. There are no other focal consolidations or pneumothorax.  There is
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to small pleural effusion.
 Osseous structures are intact.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity at the right base compatible with opacity seen on CT
 chest, most likely infarct. Small right pleural effusion.
