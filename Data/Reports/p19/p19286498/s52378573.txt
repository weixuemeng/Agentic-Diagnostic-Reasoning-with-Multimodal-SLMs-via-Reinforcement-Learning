                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient status post VATS, right
 thoracotomy, and right middle lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest once again depict volume
 loss in the right lung consistent with right middle lobectomy, as well as
 surgical clips in the right hilum.  The small layering right pleural effusion
 has resolved, and there is an expected collection of fluid occupying the right
 middle lobe resection bed, with possible pleural thickening at this location. 
 Aside from tortuosity of the aorta, the hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax, and the pulmonary vascularity is normal,
 without edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of small layering right pleural effusion with a persistent
 small amount of loculated pleural fluid occupying the right middle lobectomy
 bed, accompanied by minimal pleural thickening.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
