                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased
 opacification seen posteriorly is not appreciated on this study.  This
 suggests that it could have represented an area of atelectasis or pneumonia
 has cleared.
 
 On the current study, there is continued prominence of the cardiac silhouette
 with tortuosity of the aorta.  Multiple old healed rib fractures on the right.
 However, no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusions.
