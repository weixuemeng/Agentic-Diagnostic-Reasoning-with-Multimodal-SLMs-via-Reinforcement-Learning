                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest congestion not resolved with an antibiotic course.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  A focal opacity over the right heart border, unchanged over time,
 likely represents focal scarring.  A posterior round opacity seen on lateral
 view is not localized on frontal view.   There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacity seen posteriorly on lateral view is not localized on frontal
 view. CT chest would be necessary to exclude malignancy.
