                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and possible right mid lung nodule
 on previous chest radiograph, here to reevaluate for resolution of nodule
 following antibiotic therapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___ and CT of
 the chest performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a persistent
 peripheral ill-defined opacity projecting over the right mid lung, which is
 not appreciably changed from the preceding radiograph of ___ but new from
 the prior CT of ___.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 thoracic aorta is calcified throughout its course with extensive calcification
 of the bilateral carotid arteries as well.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged from the preceding radiograph.  Degenerative changes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent pulmonary nodule of the right mid lung.  A followup CT
 is recommended for further evaluation to exclude malignancy.
