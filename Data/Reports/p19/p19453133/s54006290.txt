                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Seasonal allergies.  Five weeks of cough, not improving.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is the suggestion of a new 11 mm wide nodule in the right mid lung at
 the level of the fourth anterior rib.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart
 size is borderline enlarged but unchanged, and there is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of central adenopathy.  Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta
 and head and neck vessels is severe, but I see no aneurysm.
 
 Given the clinical history, this nodule if present could be inflammatory.  I
 would give the lesion four weeks to resolve, and at that time obtain repeat PA
 and lateral as well as shallow oblique views of the chest to see if the nodule
 is still present.
