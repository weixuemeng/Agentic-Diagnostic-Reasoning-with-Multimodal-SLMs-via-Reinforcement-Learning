 continues to have its tip in the right pulmonary outflow tract.  There are
 layering effusions, right greater than left, with associated bibasilar
 opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  Increasing retrocardiac consolidation
 likely reflects left lower lobe collapse.  There is stable bilateral diffuse
 airspace process suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
