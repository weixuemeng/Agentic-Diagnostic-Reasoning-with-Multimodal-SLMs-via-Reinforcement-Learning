 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:13 AM
  
  
  
  Compared with the chest radiograph from earlier on the same day, the lungs
  appear better aerated, particularly in the bilateral upper lobes, suggesting
  mild improvement in the previously described pulmonary edema.  There are
  persistent right greater than left layering pleural effusions, with associated
  bibasilar opacities suggesting atelectasis.  Retrocardiac consolidation is
  again seen, likely reflecting left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
  identified.
  
  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  No
  change in the positioning of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, as
  well as in the feeding tube, which courses below the left hemi diaphragm and
  out of view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // eval for consolidation,
 atelectasis      eval for consolidation, atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 17:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter and nasogastric tube are
 unchanged in position.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above
 the carina.  The heart remains stably enlarged.  Overall, there is improving
 aeration in both lungs suggestive of resolving moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Retrocardiac consolidation persists likely reflecting lobar collapse in the
 setting of a pleural effusion.  Pneumonia in the retrocardiac area cannot be
 excluded.  The and right pleural effusion.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy for CABG.  No pneumothorax.
