 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz
 catheter with the introducer sheath remaining in place.  Interval placement of
 a left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter which has its tip in the right
 pulmonary artery.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There continues to be
 perihilar fullness and pulmonary vascular indistinctness consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Overall, aeration has improved at the right base but the
 left basilar opacity is unchanged and likely reflects lower lobe atelectasis
 in the setting of a layering effusion.  Status post median sternotomy with
 stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
