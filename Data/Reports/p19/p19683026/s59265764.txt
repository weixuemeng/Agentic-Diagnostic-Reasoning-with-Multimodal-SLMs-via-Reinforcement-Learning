                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Linear segmental atelectasis is seen in the basal portion of the
 right upper lobe.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The left lung
 is clear.  Incidental note is made of cervical spine fixation hardware.

 pneumonia. Recommended short interval follow-up to assess resolution. If this
 has not resolved a chest CT is recommended to rule out an underlying mass.
