 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intermittent chest pain, evaluation for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 No pleural effusions.  No indication for acute or chronic lung disease.  An
 apparent increase in lung density at the right apex is caused by the
 projection of the combined clavicular head and first rib.
