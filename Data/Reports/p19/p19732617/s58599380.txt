 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // Acute cardiopulmonary disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:

 is within normal limits for technique. Contour irregularities of the lower
 left lateral ribs suggest fractures, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lateral rib fractures which could be old however clinical
 correlation is suggested. Otherwise, essentially unremarkable chest x-ray.
