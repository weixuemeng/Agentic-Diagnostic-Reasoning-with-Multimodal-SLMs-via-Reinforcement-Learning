 It is very difficult to discern the tip of the endotracheal tube, however it
 appears to lie approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A right IJ sheath extends
 the midportion of the SVC. A left-sided PICC line extends to the lower SVC.
 There has been little change since the chest radiograph from the prior day,
 with an extensive retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe. There are less prominent changes at the right base, which
 appears to be improving.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity consistent with volume loss of the left lower lobe,
 with improving less prominent changes at the right lung base.
 
 2. Lines and monitoring devices as described above.
