                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest tube, hypoxia;  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier the same day at 16:59.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pigtail catheter again projects over the left lung base. There is
 no visualized pneumothorax.  Hazy opacity projects over the left mid lung with
 fiducial marker, unchanged, likely related to prior intervention.  Streaky
 right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
