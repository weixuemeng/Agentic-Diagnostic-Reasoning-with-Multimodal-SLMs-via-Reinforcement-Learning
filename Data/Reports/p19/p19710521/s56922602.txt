                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe rales.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the area of increased
 opacification in the left upper zone is less prominent, though still probably
 reflecting pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectasis and trace effusions are again
 seen and the dual-channel pacer device remains in place.
