                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, hypoxia, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen
 with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is medial left upper lobe opacity worrisome for
 consolidation.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Possible medial right upper
 lobe atelectasis/ scarring.  There may also be trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Chronic underlying interstitial prominence is again seen. The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 grossly stable given differences in patient positioning.  The diaphragm
 activity right-sided pacer obscures the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patient rotated to the left.  Additional, battery pack from the right-sided
 pacer obscures the right lung base.  Left upper lobe consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to resolution. Bibasilar atelectasis and
 possible trace pleural effusions.
