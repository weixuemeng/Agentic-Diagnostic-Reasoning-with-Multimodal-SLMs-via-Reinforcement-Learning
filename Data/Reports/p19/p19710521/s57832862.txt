                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever with recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Left upper
 lung consolidative opacities slightly increased from ___.  Subpleural
 basal predominant interstitial opacities may reflect chronic interstitial
 changes in the setting of emphysema given the increased AP diameter on the
 lateral view.  The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged with dual
 lead pacemaker is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left upper lobe consolidative opacities worsened from ___
 suggesting recurrent or residual pneumonia; however given
 recurrence/persistence neoplasm must also be considered. See subsequent CT for
 further details.
