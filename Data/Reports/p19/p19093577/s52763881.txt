                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post a fall.  Evaluate for rib injuries.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Apparent mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette may be due to the low lung
 volumes.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Clear lungs.
 2.  No evidence of fracture.
 3.  Apparent mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette may be related to low
 lung volumes.  If there is clinical concern for cardiomegaly, a repeat
 radiograph could be obtained at full inspiration.
