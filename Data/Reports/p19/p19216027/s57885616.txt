                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? pneumonia edema  // ? pneumonia edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  There has been some
 improvement in aeration of the left mid lung, possibly due to clearing of
 pulmonary edema.  There are persistent bilateral perihilar airspace opacities
 with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in appearance compared to the
 prior study.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.  Calcified pleura at
 the left apex again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rapid interval improvement in the consolidation in the left perihilar region
 suggests this may be clearing pulmonary edema.
