                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with baseline muteness, Alzheimer dementia, living in ___
 ___, presenting s/p fall while trying to get out of bed, found to
 have elevated lactate and HCAP/large L pleural effusion, and L
 intertrochanteric fracture after a fall, s/p ORIF on ___  ___/ eval for
 pneumothorax   eval for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development of
 some hazy opacification at the left base and mid zone, raising the possibility
 of some re-accumulation of pleural fluid despite the chest tube in place.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification has increased with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm medially, consistent with increasing volume
 loss in the left lower lobe.
 Otherwise little change.
