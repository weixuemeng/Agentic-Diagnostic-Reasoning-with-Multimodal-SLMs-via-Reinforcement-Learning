                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left sided chest tube  // r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low but slightly improved on the left with improved
 aeration of the left lung base.  A left-sided chest tube is in-situ, unchanged
 in appearance.  No pneumothorax seen.  There is minimal airspace opacity in
 the left lower lobe which may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema, there is
 likely a small residual pleural effusion.  There is some residual left basilar
 atelectasis.  The right lung appears grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is unchanged compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study except to note
 slight improvement in the degree of aeration of the left lung base.
