                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with posterior fossa hemorrhage, AVN coil, rule out acute
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient has been extubated.  Left lung increased opacification is accompanied
 with shift of the mediastinum.  NG tube is in adequate position and left
 subclavian line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and superior
 vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Patient has been extubated.
 2.  New left lung opacification and mediastinal shift is probably explained by
 partial lung collapse due to mucus plugging.
