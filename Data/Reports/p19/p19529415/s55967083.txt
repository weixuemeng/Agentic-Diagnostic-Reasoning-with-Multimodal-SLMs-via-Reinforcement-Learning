 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p CABG  // eval for PICC placement after
 repositioning
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 15:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval repositioning of the
 right PICC, and the loop has since resolved.  However, the tip remains at the
 distal right subclavian and appears to be heading superiorly towards the right
 internal jugular vein.  Repositioning is advised. There has otherwise been no
 relevant change.
 
 Stable mild pulmonary edema, bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC tip is in the right subclavian, heading superiorly towards the
