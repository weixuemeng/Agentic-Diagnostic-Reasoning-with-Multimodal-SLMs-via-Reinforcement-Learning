  1. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. 
  The enteric tube courses to at least the body of the stomach, although the tip
  is not visualized on the current study.
  2. Pulmonary vascular congestion is stable.  Dense left retrocardiac
  consolidation may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate
  clinical setting.  No new consolidation.  Bilateral layering pleural effusion
  are likely similar to the prior study, accounting for differences in
  technique.
