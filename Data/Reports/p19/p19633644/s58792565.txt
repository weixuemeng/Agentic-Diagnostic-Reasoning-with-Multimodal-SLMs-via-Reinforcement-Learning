                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC  // s/p flex and rigid bronch with
 stent revision and right thoracentesis 600cc
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, consolidative opacities in the right perihilar
 and apical region have partially resolved.  It is uncertain whether this
 represents an infectious pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis or a combination
 of the 2.  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy as well as a right
 endobronchial stents have been more fully evaluated by a recent CT of 3 days
 earlier.  Right pleural effusion has decreased in size since recent
 thoracentesis, with no visible pneumothorax.
