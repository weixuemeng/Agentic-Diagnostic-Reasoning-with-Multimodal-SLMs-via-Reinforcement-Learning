                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic lung cancer with sepsis, eval for
 new lung infiltrate  // eval for pneumonia     eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison 2s to ___ at 16:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ 05:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval appearance of opacity in the right upper and mid lung
 as well as increase in soft tissue in the right paratracheal and hilar region.
 When correlated with selected cross-sectional images as well as the scout
 image from the chest CT dated ___, some of these findings may
 reflect post radiation pneumonitis and lymphadenopathy, although it does
 appear that there is possibly increasing confluent opacity in the right upper
 lobe which would be concerning for superimposed infection. Clinical
 correlation is advised. The left lung is grossly clear.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated consistent with volume loss.  There is likely a
 small right effusion.  No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
