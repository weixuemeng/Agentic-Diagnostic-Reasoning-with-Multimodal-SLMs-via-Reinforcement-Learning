                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chemotherapy and radiation with weakness, evaluate for acute
 process within the chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right upper lobe opacity is improved since most recent radiograph and stable
 since CT chest from ___.  There is residual volume loss and streaky
 opacities likely due to post radiation changes.  A persistent loculated right
 pleural effusion is likely also stable.  No new consolidation is identified. 
 Known mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy are better evaluated on
 prior chest CT.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 A right mainstem endobronchial stent is again noted. Visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged volume loss and post radiation changes in the right upper lobe. No
 new consolidation identified.
