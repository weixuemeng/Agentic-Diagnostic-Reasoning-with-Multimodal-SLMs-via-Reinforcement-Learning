                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath, assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Decreased vascular congestion is accompanied by slightly decreased
 left mid lung and unchanged left lower lung opacities.  Lungs remain very low
 in volume with small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Heart is poorly
 assessed but appears mild to moderately enlarged with calcified aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased mild pulmonary vascular congestion with decrease in
 left mid lung and unchanged left lower lung opacities compatible with known
 pneumonia. Given the interval improvement, the left midlung opacity may
 reflect the result of an aspiration event.
