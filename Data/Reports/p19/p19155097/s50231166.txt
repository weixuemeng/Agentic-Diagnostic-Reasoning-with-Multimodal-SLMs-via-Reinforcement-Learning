 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, tip of the Dobbhoff
 catheter projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  The catheter could be
 advanced by approximately 5-7 cm.
 
 Otherwise, taking into account different projection, the radiographic
 appearance is unchanged.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
