                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 There is a patchy retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm,
 visible posteriorly on the lateral view.  Aside from vague asymmetric hazy
 opacity that may refer to the lingula, otherwise, the lungs appear clear. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities in the left lung, within the left lower lobe and
 possibly lingula.  This appearance is fairly typical for atelectasis but if
 there is clinical concern regarding possible development of pneumonia,
 short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to re-assess.
