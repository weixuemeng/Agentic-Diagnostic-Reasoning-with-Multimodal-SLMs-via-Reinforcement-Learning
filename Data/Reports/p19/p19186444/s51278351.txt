                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia and cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  A stent within
 the aortic valve and aortic root is again noted.  Lung volumes are low,
 limiting evaluation.  As seen previously, there is diffuse ground-glass
 opacity within the lungs which could reflect the presence of pulmonary edema,
 though given findings on recent chest CT, differential includes chronic
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse ground-glass opacities within the lungs with no
 significant change from prior exam raises concern for pulmonary edema versus
 chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis as suggested on recent CT exam.  Please
 correlate clinically.
