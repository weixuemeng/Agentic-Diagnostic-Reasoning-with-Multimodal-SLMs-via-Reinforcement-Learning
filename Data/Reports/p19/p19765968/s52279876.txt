                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with myeloma, with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A mild diffuse interstitial abnormality persists, possibly reflecting known
 airways abnormalities previously imaged by CT.  There are no new focal
 opacities.  No effusion and no pneumothorax.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  Chronic deformity of the distal right clavicle is unchanged
 from prior studies.  There is mild compression deformity of two mid-thoracic
 vertebral bodies, similarly stable.  No new fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change in diffuse interstitial prominence, without new
 focal parenchymal opacity.  Chronic osseous changes involving the distal right
 clavicle and mid-thoracic vertebral bodies are again noted.
