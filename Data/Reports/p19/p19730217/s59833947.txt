                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with possible consolidation on portable CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph obtained earlier the same day at 16:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is re- demonstrated, perhaps minimally
 improved in the interval.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are relatively
 unchanged. Bibasilar airspace opacities are also similar, and again may
 reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent mild pulmonary edema, minimally improved, with small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Similar appearing bibasilar airspace opacities, likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia is not
 excluded.
