                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new onset atrial fibrillation and fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Heart size is moderate
 to severely enlarged. Aorta is tortuous. There is mild pulmonary edema with
 vascular indistinctness. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. No acutely
 displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect compressive atelectasis though aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.
