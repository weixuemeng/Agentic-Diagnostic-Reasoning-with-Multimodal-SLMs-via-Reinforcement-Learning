                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Subtle
 relatively linear right base opacity on the frontal view, not substantiated on
 the lateral view, most likely represents atelectasis rather than focal
 consolidation.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Aortic knob calcification is noted.  No displaced fracture is seen.
