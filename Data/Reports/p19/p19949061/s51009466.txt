 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation and kyphosis.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Perihilar hazy opacities with vascular indistinctness is more pronounced on
 the right compared to the left, likely reflective of asymmetric mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Small right
 pleural effusion is likely present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Perihilar hazy opacities and vascular indistinctness, more pronounced on the
