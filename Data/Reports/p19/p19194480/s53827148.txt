                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is moderate unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta, but otherwise the mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal range.  There is mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are patchy
 predominantly streaky opacities at both lung bases that are suggestive of
 minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Moderate anterior
 osteophyte formation is noted throughout the thoracic spine.  Cholecystectomy
 clips project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Streaky bibasilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis, although not
 entirely specific.  
 
 2.  Mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly and unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
