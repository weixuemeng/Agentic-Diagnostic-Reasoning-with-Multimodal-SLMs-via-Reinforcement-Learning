                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with reposition of endotracheal tube.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable AP upright chest ___ at 6:17 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.7 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given
 portable technique and current positioning.  Streaky linear opacities at the
 left base reflect patchy atelectasis, although an early infectious process
 should also be considered.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
