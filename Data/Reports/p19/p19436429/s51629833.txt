                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset of seizures, intubated at outside hospital.  ET tube
 placement confirmation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates adjacent to the carina, possibly just
 extending into the proximal right main stem bronchus.  An orogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm, the tip is not included in this examination. 
 Lung volumes are somewhat decreased.  Increased opacity at the left lower lung
 could reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. However, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, aspiration should be considered. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates adjacent to the carina.  Recommend pulling
 back at least 4 cm to ensure adequate positioning. 
 
 2.  Increased opacity at the left lung base could reflect a combination of
 pleural effusion and volume loss. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 however, aspiration should also be considered.
