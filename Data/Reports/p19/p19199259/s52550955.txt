                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with one-week history of dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss
 since two months, home pigeons, high risk sexual activity, rule out pneumonia,
 evidence of PCP, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Faint ground-glass opacities are seen adjacent to right heart border, but
 there is no correspondence on the lateral view.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Faint ground-glass opacities are seen only on the PA view adjacent to the
 right heart border.  In the context of newly diagnosed HIV, an infection (PCP
 ) cannot be excluded.  The patient is known with pigeon at home, so
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis can also be considered.
 
 This has been discussed with Dr. ___ ___ two options are available:  we
 can repeat the chest x-ray with oblique views to see if the opacities are
 real.  Otherwise, we can go directly to CT scan.
