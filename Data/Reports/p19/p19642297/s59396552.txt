 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F hx of COPD s/p RLE CFA/profunda embolectomy, now desay  // ?
 consolidation/effusion      ? consolidation/effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the hip opacification at the right
 base again could reflect either atelectatic changes or an area of
 consolidation.  There has been the development of similar but less prominent
 opacification at the left base, which most likely represents atelectatic
 change.
 In the absence of a lateral view, it is difficult to assess the possibility of
 pleural effusion.  No appreciable vascular congestion.
