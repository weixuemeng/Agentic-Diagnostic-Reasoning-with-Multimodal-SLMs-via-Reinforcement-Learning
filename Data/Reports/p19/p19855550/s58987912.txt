 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, atelectasis on CTA chest, eval
 for improved aeration with NIPPV  // eval for improved aeration with NIPPV
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA, 17:58 on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions may have enlarged. Severe consolidation at
 both lung bases, should be considered pneumonia into approved otherwise. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal, heart size is normal, and mild mediastinal
 venous engorgement suggest a increased intravascular volume, but not heart
 failure, and therefore the appearance of the lower lungs cannot be attributed
 to dependent edema.
