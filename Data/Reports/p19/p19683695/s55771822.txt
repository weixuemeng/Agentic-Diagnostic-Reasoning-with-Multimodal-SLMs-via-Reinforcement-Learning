                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia secondary to congestive heart
 failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged since ___.  Heart size is mild to
 moderately enlarged and similar since at least ___.  Bilateral lower
 lung opacities and increased retrocardiac density, likely represent
 atelectasis and/or consolidation in combination with bilateral pleural
 effusions, mild-to-moderate left and minimal right, and has not really changed
 much since last 24 hours.  Concurrently associated bilateral lower lung
 infection cannot be ruled out, and needs clinical correlation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, bilateral lower lung opacities
 due to combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation, mild-to-moderate left
 and minimal right pleural effusions and mild to moderately enlarged heart size
 have not changed over last 24 hours.  Concurrently associated infection in
 lower lungs cannot be ruled out, clinical correlation is required.
