                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains moderately enlarged. 
 The aortic knob is calcified.  There is perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally, a moderate
 left pleural effusion has increased from the prior study, and a small right
 pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities
 may reflect compressive atelectasis, though infection, particularly in the
 left lower lobe cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is present. No acute
 osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with increased moderate-sized left pleural
 effusion, and similar-sized right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis, though infection cannot be
 excluded.
