 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC line has been removed.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 persistent patchy opacity at the left lung base, suggesting a combination of
 atelectasis or consolidation and most likely with a small pleural effusion,
 but not well delineated.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct and
 prominent suggesting mild vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Persistent patchy
 left basilar opacity, probably parenchymal opacity with small pleural
 effusion, although not well delineated.
