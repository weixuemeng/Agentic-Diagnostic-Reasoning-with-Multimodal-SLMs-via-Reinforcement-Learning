                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with NGT. Assess NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 placement of an enteric feeding tube coursing mid line with side port at the
 level of the diaphragms and tip within the stomach.
 
 Moderately well inflated lungs with persistent linear atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax.  Again seen is linear scarring in the lungs and pleural
 scarring, similar to previous examination.  Stable small left pleural effusion
 with scarring. No new focal opacity. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are within normal limits and
 upper abdomen demonstrates pneumobilia as seen on previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Enteric feeding tube with side port at level of the diaphragm and tip
 within the stomach. Consider advancing 3-5 cm for better positioning.
 2.  Stable chest, with linear atelectasis, scarring, and small left pleural
 effusion.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 3.  Persistent pneumobilia, as seen on CT from ___.
