                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS: The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The horizontal
 linear opacity in the right lung base is unchanged from the prior study and
 may represent scarring or abnormal branching of a vessel.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.  Degenerative change of the right acromioclavicular joint is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
