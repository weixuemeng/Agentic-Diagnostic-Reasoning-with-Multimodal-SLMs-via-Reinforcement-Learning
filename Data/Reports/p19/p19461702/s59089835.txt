                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation, respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  An enteric tube
 is seen coursing to the left of midline into the medial left lower hemithorax
 and does not traverse below the diaphragm.  The tube is in inappropriate
 position and its presence is may be within a left lower lobe airway versus
 within a tortuous distal esophagus.  Recommend removal and replacement. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.2 cm above the level of
 the carina.  It is difficult to exclude trace pleural effusion, although no
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is left basilar atelectasis.  There is
 prominent biapical scarring.  Ovoid calcific structures project over the left
 upper hemithorax which may represent calcified granulomas or other
 calcification.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Inappropriate position of enteric tube.  Recommend removal and
 replacement.  This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:15 p.m.
 on ___ via telephone, ___ minutes after discovery.
