 HISTORY:  Upper abdominal pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are mild increased retrocardiac opacities.  Mild increase interstitial
 findings are noted and may represent minimal pulmonary edema.  The patient is
 status post mitral valve surgery with intact median sternotomy wires and
 mitral valve prosthesis.  The lungs are clear with no evidence of a focal
 consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are normal.  No acute fractures are identified.

 Mild left baisilar opacities likely representing atelectasis, though an early
 overlying infectious process must be excluded in proper clinical setting. 
 Minimal pulmonary edema.
