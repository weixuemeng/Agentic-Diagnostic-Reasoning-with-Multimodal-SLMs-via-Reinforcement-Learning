                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met breast cancer on chemotherapy, new
 onset dyspnea on exertion, evaluate for pulmonary etiology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  FDG PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Heart size
 is top-normal.  The hila are within normal limits.  Linear opacities at the
 right mid lung and right lower lobe may represent platelike atelectasis,
 however it is difficult to exclude developing or interstitial pneumonia. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Linear opacities in the right middle and lower lobes are nonspecific,
 possibly platelike atelectasis, however developing, especially interstitial
 pneumonia (e.g. viral or atypical bacterial), could also give this appearance
 2. No evidence of diffuse interstitial lung abnormality.
