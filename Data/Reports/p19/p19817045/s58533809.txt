 chest wall pain      Please eval new chest wall pain
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 Atelectasis in the right middle lung either in the middle lobe or anterior
 segment of the upper lobe has increased.  Milder atelectasis in the left lower
 lung has also increased.  There has been no interval change in the relatively
 normal appearance of the cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  There is no
 pleural abnormality.  No large chest wall abnormality is seen but this study
 is not sensitive in assessment of chest cage or soft tissues.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):    I would recommend instead marking the area of focal
 concern and requesting either rib detail views or chest CT.
