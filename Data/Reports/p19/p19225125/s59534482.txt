                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elevated lactate, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Prominent epicardial fat pad
 likely accounts for the haziness along the cardiac margins.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
