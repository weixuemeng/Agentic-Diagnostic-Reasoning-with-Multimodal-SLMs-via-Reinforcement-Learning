                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST 12:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. 
 Febrile with a cough.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion is stable.  There is no mediastinal vascular engorgement
 to suggest tamponade physiology.  Left lung is entirely clear.  Mild
 peribronchial opacification is suggested in the right lower lung.  This could
 be very early pneumonia or residual fluid from hemodialysis.  Right jugular
 line ends in the upper right atrium.  No pleural effusion.
