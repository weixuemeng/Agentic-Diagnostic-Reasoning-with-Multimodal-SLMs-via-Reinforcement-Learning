 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:04 AM
  As compared to the previous radiograph, the millimetric left apical
  pneumothorax without evidence of tension persists.  The lung volumes have
  slightly decreased. The heart continues to be enlarged.  The pre described
  focal airspace opacity in the right upper lobe, described in the previous
  report, has increased in extent and severity, suggesting, as previously noted,
  the presence of pneumonia.
  No newly appeared opacities.  Mild pulmonary edema persists.
