                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with L elbow cellulitis and tachypnea.  //
 **PLEASE ENSURE GOOD INSPIRATORY EFFORT** ?tracheal deviation seen on previous
 CXR today vs. poor inspiratory effort
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously reported tracheal deviation at the thoracic inlet level is a
 persistent finding.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis has slightly worsened.  No other relevant change.
