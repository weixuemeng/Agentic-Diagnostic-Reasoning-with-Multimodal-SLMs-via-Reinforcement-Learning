                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Lung volumes are low which
 accentuate the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately
 enlarged. Aorta remains tortuous and calcified. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. A
 small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small left pleural effusion.
