                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with L wrist fracture, pre-op, 1 view OK
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single frontal AP upright view the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment.  The heart appears moderately enlarged though this may be
 partially exaggerated by technique.  In the setting of low lung volumes, the
 lungs appear relatively clear though the retrocardiac space is poorly
 assessed.  No large pneumothorax or effusion is seen.  The mediastinal contour
 cannot be assessed.  No definite fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
