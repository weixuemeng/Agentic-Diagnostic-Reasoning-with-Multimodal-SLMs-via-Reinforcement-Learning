                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post tPA for MCA stroke
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Emphysematous changes are noted within the lung apices.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  A surgical anchor is noted within the left humeral
 head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.
