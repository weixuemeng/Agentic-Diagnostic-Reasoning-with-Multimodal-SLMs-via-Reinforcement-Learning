 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is a moderate right and
 probably small left pleural effusion.  Continued substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion, a discordance
 that suggests underlying cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion.  There
 is pacemaker with single lead extending to the apex of the right ventricle. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs with some coarseness of interstitial markings
 raises the possibility of chronic pulmonary disease.  No acute focal
 pneumonia.
