                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with right upper quadrant pain, assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 There is a retrocardiac opacity containing air likely representing a hiatal
 hernia, which was better assessed on the prior CT chest.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia redemonstrated.  No signs of pneumonia or other
 acute intrathoracic process.
