                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea for two days.  History of pericardial
 effusion, hypotensive at clinic
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains moderate to severely enlarged, with a globular
 configuration, compatible with known pericardial effusion. Mediastinal contour
 remains unchanged. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is present. Small left
 pleural effusion is similar compared to the prior exam. A trace right pleural
 effusion is also re- demonstrated. No pneumothorax is present.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar enlargement of the cardiac silhouette compatible with known
 pericardial effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.
