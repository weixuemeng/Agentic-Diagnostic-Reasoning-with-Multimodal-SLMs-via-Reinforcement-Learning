                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p fall w cxr c/w contusions vs diffuse
 infiltrates  // pls eval for interval changes      pls eval for interval
 changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications are again seen bilaterally. As seen on the recent CT, the
 findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia. The pattern on radiographs
 raises the possibility of septic emboli, especially if the patient has
 vegetations on cardiac valve spur.
 The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Right IJ catheter
 the extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
 There is suggestion of increased opacification with possible cavitation in the
 right apical region, though this could be mimicked by a combination of
 consolidation and overlying bony structures.
