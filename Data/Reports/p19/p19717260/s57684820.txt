  Multiple bilateral patchy opacities projecting over the lungs. Differential
  diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia however, metastatic disease not

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // chf?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, today, at 12:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are multiple bilateral patchy opacities in the lung, the largest in the
 lateral left mid lung zone but also seen in the right greater than left
 bibasilar regions and possibly in the upper lobes as well.  Differential
 diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia versus neoplastic process, metastatic
 disease, particularly if patient has a known primary. Given history of trauma,
 pulmonary contusion cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion is seen.
 Difficult to exclude a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous. This is a partially imaged the proximal left humerus fracture.
