                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the frontal radiograph, there is an ill-defined opacification at
 the right lower lung laterally as well as a increased opacity seen below the
 diaphragm margin.  On the lateral view, there is a linear opacity which is
 obscuring portion of the right hemidiaphragm but with lung parenchyma
 posterior to this opacity.   There is minimal blunting of the right lateral
 and posterior costophrenic sulcus, suggesting a small pleural effusion.  No
 focal opacities are identified in the left.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  No bony abnormalities
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting, likely multifocal. Follow up in ___ weeks after
 treatment is suggested to assess for resolution.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
