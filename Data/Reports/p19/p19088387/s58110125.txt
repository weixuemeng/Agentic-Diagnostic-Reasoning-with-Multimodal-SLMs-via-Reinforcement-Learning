                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with substernal chest pain, hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated which could suggest chronic pulmonary disease. 
 Right greater than left increased interstitial markings are nonspecific but
 could reflect edema, less likely infection depending on the clinical
 situation.  Nonetheless bilateral central airspace opacities and mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly suggests a component of volume overload.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are moderate.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most suggestive of volume overload and/or heart failure, although of
 the patient has fever, infection is possible.
