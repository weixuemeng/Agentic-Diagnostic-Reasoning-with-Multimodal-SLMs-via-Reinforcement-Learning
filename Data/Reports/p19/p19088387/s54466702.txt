                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and heart failure,
 now with worsening hypoxia.  Evaluate for an acute pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Interval increase in bilateral interstitial markings and central ill-defined
 opacities, more pronounced on the right, suggests worsening, moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema.  Increased, focal opacity in the right apex with
 silhouetting of the right paratracheal stripe may represent pneumonia or
 alveolar edema in the right upper lobe.  Right upper lobe alveolar edema can
 be seen in severe mitral regurgitation.  Consider echocardiographic evaluation
 if clinically indicated.  New, small, bilateral pleural effusions with
 increasing atelectasis at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening, moderate to severe pulmonary edema with new, small bilateral
 pleural effusions and new consolidation in the right upper lobe which may
 reflect infection or alveolar edema.  Right upper lobe alveolar edema can be
 seen in severe mitral regurgitation.  Consider echocardiographic evaluation if
 clinically indicated.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider echocardiogram to evaluate for mitral
 regurgitation if clinically indicated.
