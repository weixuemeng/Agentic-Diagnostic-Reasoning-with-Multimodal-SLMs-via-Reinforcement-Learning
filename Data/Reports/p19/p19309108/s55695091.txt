 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and sob  // chest pain and sob
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Prominent costochondral calcifications are seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  Small nodule opacity projecting over the right lower
 lung on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view is again seen
 and most likely relates to costochondral calcification.  Mild basilar
 atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.

 COPD.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note that CT is more
 sensitive in assessing for pulmonary nodules.
