 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 723 today.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New upper enteric drainage tube passes as far as the mid portion of a
 nondistended stomach.  Lungs are reasonably well expanded and clear.  Relative
 elevation right hemidiaphragm is unexplained. Conventional PA and lateral
 chest radiographs would help that determination. There is no pleural
 abnormality or evidence of central adenopathy and no pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
