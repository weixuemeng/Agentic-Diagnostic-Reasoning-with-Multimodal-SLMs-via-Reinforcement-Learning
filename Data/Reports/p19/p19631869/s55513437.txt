 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMHx notable for congestive heart failure (EF ___%),
 aortic stenosis s/p TAVR (___), 3-vessel coronary artery disease (s/p PCI
 of the LAD and RCA), paroxysmal afib (previously on amio), COPD on home

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the core valve is again seen with
 continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar opacification is
 consistent with atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, coalescent
 areas at the left and possibly right base could raise the possibility of
 developing aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
