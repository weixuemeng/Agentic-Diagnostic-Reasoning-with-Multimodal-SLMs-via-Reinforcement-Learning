                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 minimal prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, but no frank pulmonary edema
 is seen.  A 3-mm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung field
 likely reflects a calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Remote right seventh rib fracture
 is present.  There are cholecystectomy clips noted in the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
