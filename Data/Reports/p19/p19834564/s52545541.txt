                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fall, right chest
 pain, question rib fracture, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture seen. 
 If clinical concern for rib fracture persists, consider dedicated rib series
 which is more sensitive.
