                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Respiratory arrest.  Tracheostomy performed at outside
 hospital.  Evaluation for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph performed four hours prior.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  A tracheostomy tube ends 6 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and ends off of the
 radiograph.  There are diffuse alveolar opacities in a predominantly perihilar
 location.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no free air
 beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  The
 soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse predominantly perihilar airspace opacities with relative
 sparing of the costophrenic angles are concerning for acute respiratory
 distress syndrome.  For further details, please see the chest CT performed the
 same day.
