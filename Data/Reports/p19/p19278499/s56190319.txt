                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff problem, is it kinked?
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 again a Dobbhoff tube in place, which extends to the upper stomach, then coils
 upon itself.  This coil is close to the junction of the opaque portion of the
 tube with the more lucent portion and conceivably could represent some
 kinking.  Thought should be given to pulling the tube out somewhat with the
 hope that the opaque part will turn downward.
