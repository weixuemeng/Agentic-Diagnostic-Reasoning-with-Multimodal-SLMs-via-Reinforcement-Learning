 COPD w/ high-grade SBO, now s/p exlap, LOA, abdomen left open ___ now s/p
 closure ___, no afib with RVR to 150s. R/o acute cardiopulmonaruy process,

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube. The right internal
 jugular central line is unchanged.  The degree of vascular congestion is less
 prominent. However, a right lower lobe opacity appears more coalescent, which
 could be postsurgical substantial atelectasis. However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered. There is a
 left-sided pleural effusion. The heart and mediastinal contours are stable and
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  More coalescent right lower lobe opacity could be merely substantial
 atelectasis after surgery, but in the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia is considered.
