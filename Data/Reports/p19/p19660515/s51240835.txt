                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF, intubated for airway protection 
 // Eval ETT position, interval change in pulmonary status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the carina.  A right IJ catheter
 terminates at the mid to lower SVC.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  The
 opacity at the right lung base appears to be improving compared to prior
 studies likely resolving atelectasis.  Opacification of the left lung base is
 likely due to the small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Since the
 prior radiograph performed 2 days earlier, there has been interval enlargement
 in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned at 5.7cm above the carina.
 2.  Interval enlargement of cardiomediastinal silhouette over past several
 days, which may be due to portable technique/change in patient positioning. 
 Alternative diagnostic considerations include worsening heart failure vs. 
 developing pericardial effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ at
 10:09am.
