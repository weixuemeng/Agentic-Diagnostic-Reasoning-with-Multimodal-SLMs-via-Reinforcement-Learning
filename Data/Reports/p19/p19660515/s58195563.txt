                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___ from an outside facility, the
 cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size.  There is
 hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD. 
 Some coarseness of interstitial markings could also be a manifestation of
 chronic pulmonary disease.  There is some asymmetry at the bases with the
 opacification on the left most likely reflecting atelectatic changes.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a developing consolidation,
 which should be assessed on subsequent radiographs.
