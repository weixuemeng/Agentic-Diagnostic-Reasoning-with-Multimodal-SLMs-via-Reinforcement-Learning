                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 within normal limits allowing for accentuation by apical lordotic and portable
 technique.  Lungs are overexpanded suggesting COPD. Patchy and linear
 bibasilar lung opacities are likely due to atelectasis.  Aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia are less likely, but followup PA and lateral chest
 radiographs would be helpful for more complete assessment when the patient's
 condition allows.
