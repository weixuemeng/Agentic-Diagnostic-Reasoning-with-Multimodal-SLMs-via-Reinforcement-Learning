  In comparison to the outside hospital radiograph from earlier on the same day,
  there is an increasing heterogeneous opacity of the right lung base,
  concerning for pneumonia. Followup radiographs recommended. Enteric tube is
  seen terminating below the field of view. Blunting of the left costophrenic
  angle is secondary to prominent mediastinal fat.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SBO  // cardiopulm process      cardiopulm
 process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date at an outside facility,
 there is patchy increased opacification at the right base, worrisome for
 pneumonia. Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectatic
 changes and small pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the
 upper stomach, although the side port is at the level of the esophagogastric
 junction.
