                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p chemoradiation for laryngeal cancer, mouth pain, poor PO
 intake, chronic cough with fever spikes. Assess for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mildly hyper expanded lungs
 with bibasilar atelectasis. Left lung is clear. Faint heterogeneous opacity
 within the right middle lobe. Again seen is subtle blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely related to scar versus small pleural effusion. No
 right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and
 hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right middle lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration
 pneumonia.
 2.  Persistent blunting of left costophrenic angle likely related to scar or
 small chronic pleural effusion.
 3.  Mildly hyperinflated lungs.
