                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  Prominence of the
 central pulmonary arteries is present bilaterally.  Lungs are slightly
 overexpanded but grossly clear except for focal linear atelectasis versus scar
 at the left lung base.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal linear opacity in left lower lobe is a very nonspecific
 finding, but linear atelectasis can be observed in the setting of pulmonary
 embolism, the clinically suspected diagnosis provided in the history for this
 exam.  
 
 With this in mind, further evaluation with CT pulmonary angiogram should be
 considered to more definitively evaluate for the possibility of pulmonary
 embolism given the clinical suspicion for this entity.
