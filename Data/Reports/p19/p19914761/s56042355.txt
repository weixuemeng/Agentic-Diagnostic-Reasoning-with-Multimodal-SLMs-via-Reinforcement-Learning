                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple supine AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overlying trauma board limits evaluation.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates
 approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube is noted within the
 stomach and the tip projects off the inferior borders of the film.  Bilateral
 chest tubes are noted terminating near the lung apices.  Left subclavian
 central venous catheter tip terminates within the upper SVC.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The superior mediastinum is widened.  Small
 bilateral pneumothoraces are present.  Minimal streaky opacity is noted in the
 left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis.  More focal opacity is also
 seen within the left mid lung field, which is nonspecific.  No pleural
 effusion is identified.  There are multiple bilateral rib fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Lines and tubes in standard positions.
 
 2. Widened superior mediastinum.  Subsequent CT of the torso demonstrated an
 extensive type A aortic dissection.
 
 3. Small bilateral apical pneumothoraces.
 
 4. Streaky opacity left lung base may reflect atelectasis.  More focal opacity
 in the left mid lung field is nonspecific but could reflect an area of
 aspiration or contusion.
