                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube measures approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Obliquity of
 the patient makes it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs, but there is
 no definite change from the prior examination.
