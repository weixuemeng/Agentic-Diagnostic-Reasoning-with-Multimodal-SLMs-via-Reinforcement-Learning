 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:03 PM
  Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation. Subtle hazy opacities in right lower
  lung may be secondary to low lung volumes, but early infection cannot be
  excluded. Linear opacity in left lower lung field likely atelectasis. If
  concerned, further evaluation with dedicated frontal and lateral chest
  radiographs could be performed. No pneumothorax or effusion on this view.
  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 19:45 on ___.

 A new C-shaped region of opacity in the left lower lung accompanied by more
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is atelectasis.  Volume in the right lung
 has also decreased.  There is greater distention of mediastinal vasculature
 and a slight increase in cardiac caliber, but no pulmonary edema.  Pleural
 effusions are small if any.  Multiple healed right rib fractures noted. 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
