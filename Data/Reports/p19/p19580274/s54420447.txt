                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with palpitations and dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The
 aorta remains tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are noted in
 the lung bases.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Mild degenerative spurring is visualized in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  Infection is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
