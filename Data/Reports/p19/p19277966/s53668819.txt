                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hematemesis/hemoptysis  with lung  cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ from Atrius
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Known mediastinal mass seen on outside imaging is not well assessed on this
 current radiograph, although there is suggestion of narrowing of the central
 airways, as seen on the prior CT.  Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous
 changes noted in the apices.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction is unchanged from the prior CT examination where it was
 demonstrated to be a pathologic fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known mediastinal mass is better assessed on previous CT.  Emphysema.  No
 pneumonia.
