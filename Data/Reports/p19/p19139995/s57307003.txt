 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p BiV ICD implant  // PTX, leads
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a left
 pectorally placed biventricular ICD.  The leads appear intact and project over
 the expected location of the right  and left ventricle.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is severe cardiomegaly without evidence of overt
 pulmonary edema.  Bowel replacement are identified as are median sternotomy
 wires.  Previously seen right pleural effusion is decreased in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with interval placement of biventricular ICD, its leads
 which project over the right and left ventricles.  No pneumothorax.
