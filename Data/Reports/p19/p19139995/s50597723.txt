                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AVR,MVR, TVrepair, asc aortic replacement 
 // follow up effusion, eval for pneumothorax s/p L CT removal      follow up
 effusion, eval for pneumothorax s/p L CT removal
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild elevation
 in pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Continued opacification at the left base is consistent
 with pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe.  There is some increase
 in opacification at the right base.  Although this could merely reflect
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia could
 be considered.
