                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AVR/MVR/TVr, ASC Ao  // interval change in
 fullness around aorta
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is very slight rotated positioning.
 
 Multiple lines and tubes are present, nominal in position.  The right IJ
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip may lie in the RV or at the origin of the pulmonary
 outflow tract.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve.  The
 aortic valve is indistinct, but not clearly changed compared with the most
 recent prior film. Equivocal slight convexity is seen in the region of the
 aortopulmonary window, in the setting of air bronchograms and consolidation
 around the lobar and segmental airways.
 
 Mild vascular plethora is again noted, grossly unchanged.
 
 Also again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with
 obscuration left hemidiaphragm.  This has probably increased slightly compare
 with the prior film.  The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be
 excluded.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base is slightly increased.  No
 gross effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as described.
 2. Cardiomediastinal silhouette, including indistinctness of the aortic arch,
 is grossly unchanged.  Question minimal new convexity in the aortopulmonary
 window.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation may be slightly worse.
 4. Minimal atelectasis at the right base is slightly increased.
 5. No gross pleural effusion is seen on either side.
 6. Mild vascular plethora is grossly unchanged.
