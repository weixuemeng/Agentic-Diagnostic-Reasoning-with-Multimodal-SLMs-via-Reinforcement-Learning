                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD with cough and weakness
 for 1 week and right upper lobe rhonchi.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight rotation of the patient limits assessment, with obscuration of the
 right heart border due to superimposition with the spine. The lungs are
 hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragm and attenuation of the
 peripheral vessels compatible with emphysema. There are no focal opacities
 concerning for pneumonia. Linear opacities in the left lung base were present
 on ___ and likely represent scarring. Mild cardiomegaly is
 redemonstrated with significant contribution from the left atrium. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A bicameral pacemaker is redemonstrated with
 the leads ending in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs. No evidence of pneumonia.
