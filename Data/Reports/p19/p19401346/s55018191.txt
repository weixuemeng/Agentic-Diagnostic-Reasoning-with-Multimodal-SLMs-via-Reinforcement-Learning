 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Mild
 atelectatic or fibrotic changes at the left base, and a dual-channel pacer
 device with leads in appropriate position.  Otherwise, little change with no
 evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
