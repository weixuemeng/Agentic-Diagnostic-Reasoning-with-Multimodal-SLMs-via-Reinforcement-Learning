                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and lethargy.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  The extreme right costophrenic
 sulcus is partly excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity in the left lower lung suggests minor
 atelectasis, probably unchanged.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
