                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Decreased breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size remains top
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification
 of the aortic knob.  There continues to be minimal patchy opacities in the
 lung bases which may reflect atelectasis.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement
 is definitively noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present, but
 no pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases with possible small pleural
 effusions.  No evidence for pulmonary edema.
