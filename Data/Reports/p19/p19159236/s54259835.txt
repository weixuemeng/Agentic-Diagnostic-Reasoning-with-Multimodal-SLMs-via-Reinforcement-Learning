                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There lungs are low in volume but without focal consolidation. 
 Diffuse opacities likely reflect mild pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac size and cardiac silhouette are
 obscured by low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema. Repeat imaging after diuresis is
 recommended to evaluate for concomitant pneumonia.
