                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  There is,
 however, suggestion of diffuse increased interstitial markings with more
 confluent opacities at the lung bases.  While these could be due to impart
 atelectasis, underlying edema or infection is also suspected.  Cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, worse at the bases, left greater
 than right, suggestive of underlying edema or bilateral infection superimposed
 on atelectasis.  PA and lateral with better inspiratory effort may help
 further characterize.
