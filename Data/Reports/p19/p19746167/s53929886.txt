                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post right subclavian approach
 Port-A-Cath placement, evaluate for tip position and possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  No preceding chest examination is available for comparison. 
 A right subclavian approach line is seen apparently related to a most recent
 Port-A-Cath system placement.  The line terminates at the level 6 cm below the
 carina, and related to the demonstrated external cardiac contours, it may have
 reached the upper portion of the right atrium.  The heart does not appear
 enlarged, and no configurational abnormality is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion, and no pleural effusions that are blunting the
 lateral pleural sinuses.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Surgical clips
 in the mid portion of the upper abdomen, indicative of previous surgery, type
 unknown.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of Port-A-Cath line reaching in upper portion of right
 atrium.  This is not an unusual finding and appears well tolerated as the
 Port-A-Cath lines are not very flexible.  If the purpose is to terminate in
 the lower SVC, withdrawal of the line by 3 cm is recommended.
