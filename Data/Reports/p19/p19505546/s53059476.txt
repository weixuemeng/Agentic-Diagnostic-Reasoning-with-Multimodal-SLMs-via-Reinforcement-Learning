                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic cancer, shortness of breath, assess pneumonia or
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated without discrete focal lesion or signs of pneumonia or CHF. 
 There is a vague density at the right infrahilar region which likely
 corresponds with a chest wall density as seen on the lateral view.  Please
 correlate for chest wall palpable abnormalities.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ague opacity projecting over the right infrahilar region likely
 corresponds with a chest wall contour abnormality (seen on lateral view) for
 which clinical correlation is advised.  Given the history of metastatic cancer
 if there is concern for metastatic disease in the chest, a CT is recommended
 to further assess.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs likely reflect COPD.
