                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new electronic device resides in the subcutaneous soft tissues
 overlying the left mid chest.  Allowing for differences in technique, the only
 other change is an apparent increase in the size of the heart, which now
 appears mildly enlarged.  Streaky lingular opacity suggests minor scarring. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of acute disease.
