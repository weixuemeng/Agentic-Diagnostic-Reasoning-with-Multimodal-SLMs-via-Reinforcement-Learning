 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is
 again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with suggestion of some central
 pulmonary vascular congestion. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, raising
 the possibility of a small pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. In
 the left mid to lower zone, there is a suggestion of a somewhat ill-defined
 area of increased opacification. This could possibly represent a pulmonary
 nodule.
 Extensive posttraumatic changes are seen in the right ribs as well as
 dislocation about the right shoulder joint.
