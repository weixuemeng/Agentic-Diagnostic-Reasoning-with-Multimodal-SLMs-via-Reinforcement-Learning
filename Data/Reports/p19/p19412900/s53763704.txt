                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low.  Linear
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or pleural effusions.  The vasculature appears sclerotic secondary to low lung
 volumes.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
 
 Numerous mediastinal clips are noted.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact. 
 The intended right ventricular pacer follows a nonstandard course. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or effusions. Transvenous
 ventricular pacing lead either cannulates the coronary sinus and a surface
 cardiac vein to the cardiac apex or goes through the interventricular septum
 or navigates a ventricular transposition.  Clinical correlation, including
 functional assessment would be required for clarification.
