                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fevers for 1 day.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Compared to prior, there is improved
 left basilar aeration compared to prior.  Retrocardiac air-fluid level is
 suggestive of a hiatal hernia unchanged from priors.  Posterior costophrenic
 angles are not well seen potentially due to effusions.  Superiorly, the lungs
 are clear.  Cardiac enlargement stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Left PICC is seen with tip in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable small bilateral effusions without acute cardiopulmonary process.
