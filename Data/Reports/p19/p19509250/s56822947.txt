                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Assess acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low and the patient is rotated to the right, which limits the evaluation. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis with probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The heart appears enlarged, though this could be in part magnified
 due to technique.  Possibility of pneumonia at the lung bases cannot be
 excluded, though atelectasis is favored.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Mediastinal contour is difficult to assess.  No bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, difficult to exclude an early pneumonia. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions redemonstrated.
