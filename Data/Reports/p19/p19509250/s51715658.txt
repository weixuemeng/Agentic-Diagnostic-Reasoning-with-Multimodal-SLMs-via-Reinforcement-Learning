 position of an inferior vena cava filter is constant. The previously
 malpositioned left-sided central line has been removed and replaced by a right
 internal jugular vein catheter. This catheter shows a normal course, the tip
 projects over the upper parts of the right atrium and should be pulled back by

 pulmonary edema. Bilateral areas of basilar atelectasis, no pneumonia.
