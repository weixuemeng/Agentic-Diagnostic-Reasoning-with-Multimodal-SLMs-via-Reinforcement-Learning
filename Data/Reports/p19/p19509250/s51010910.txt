                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  One day chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  MR thoracic spine ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged. 
 The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, with a small amount of fluid in
 the minor fissure on the right.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities most
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  Compression
 deformity of the T11 vertebral body is unchanged compared to the prior MRI.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
