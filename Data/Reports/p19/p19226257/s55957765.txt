                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with orogastric tube placement.  Evaluate for
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable supine frontal radiographs were obtained during the
 placement of an orogastric tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the first view, the orogastric tube is seen looping at the level
 of the lower neck.  In a subsequent radiograph, the orogastric tube is seen in
 the upper abdomen with the tip out of view.  There is an endotracheal tube
 that ends 2.7 cm above the carina. 
 
 Lung volumes are low accounting for some bronchovascular crowding but no focal
 opacities.  Minimal interstitial thickening is present. Moderate cardiomegaly
 obscures the left lung base.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  An orogastric tube ends in the
 abdomen with the tip out of view.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly with a minimal interstitial thickening suggesting
 minimal interstitial edema in the setting of low lung volumes.
