                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Two days of pleuritic chest pain.  Question pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 lung volumes are low.  There is no evidence for substantial pleural effusion,
 although a very small one would be difficult to completely exclude on the left
 side.  Instead, the main finding is opacification of the left lower lobe
 suggesting pneumonia.  There is similar reverse S-shaped curvature to the
 visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting left lower lobe pneumonia.
