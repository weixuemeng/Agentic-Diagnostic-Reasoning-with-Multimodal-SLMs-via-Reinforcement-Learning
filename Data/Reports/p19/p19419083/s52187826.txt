                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia or evidence of
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new focal airspace opacities in the right lung base, with
 corresponding increased density in the lower lobe on the lateral view,
 concerning for right lower lobe pneumonia, possibly aspiration.  A
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged from ___. 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs is redemonstrated.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary
 edema.
 
 There is exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic spine.  A well-circumscribed
 density projecting within a mid thoracic vertebral body likely corresponds to
 a bone island.  Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the visualized
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New focal opacities in the right lung base concerning for right lower lobe
 pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged small-to-moderate left pleural effusion from ___.
