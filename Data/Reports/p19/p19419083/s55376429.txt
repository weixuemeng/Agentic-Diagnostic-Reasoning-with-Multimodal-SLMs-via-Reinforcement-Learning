                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 clearing of the right basilar opacification.  Some of the residual may merely
 reflect a combination of atelectasis and fibrosis.  There has also been
 substantial clearing of the left pleural effusion.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with hyperexpansion of the
 lungs.  Coarse appearance of pulmonary markings could reflect elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.
