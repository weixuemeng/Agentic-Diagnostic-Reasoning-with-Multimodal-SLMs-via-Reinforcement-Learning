                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and cough with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with flattening
 of the hemidiaphragms.  Prominence of interstitial markings could reflect
 chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both.  There is a
 small left pneumothorax.  No definite acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note are clips in the neck, suggestive of thyroid surgery.
