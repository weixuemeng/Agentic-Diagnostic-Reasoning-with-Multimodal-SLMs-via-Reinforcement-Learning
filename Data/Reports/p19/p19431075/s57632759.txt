                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, history of liver transplantation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to the patient's chin obscuring assessment of
 the lung apices.  Additionally, the patient is mildly rotated.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
