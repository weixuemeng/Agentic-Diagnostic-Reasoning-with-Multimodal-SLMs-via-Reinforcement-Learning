                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cirrhosis status post total hip replacement,
 now with acute onset dyspnea concerning for aspiration.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A weighted esophageal catheter terminates in the region of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  A right PICC terminates in the mid superior vena
 cava, which appears retracted compared to prior.  Retrocardiac density likely
 corresponds to known left lower lobe consolidation, better seen on today's CT.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema is evident on
 this view.  The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, as seen on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lower lobe consolidation, better evaluated on CT.
 
 2.  Weighted enteric catheter with tip in the region of the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Subsequent radiographs demonstrate interval repositioning of the
 enteric catheter.
