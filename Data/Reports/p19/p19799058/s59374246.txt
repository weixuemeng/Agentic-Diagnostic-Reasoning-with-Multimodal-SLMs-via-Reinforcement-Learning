 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Nodular
 calcified structure projecting over the right lower lobe most likely
 represents calcified granuloma or relates to costochondral calcification.  A
 calcified lymph node is again seen in the AP window.  No focal consolidation,
 large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Evidence of
 hiatal hernia is again seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
