                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 5 weeks of cough, history of lung cancer
 and rhonchi on exam  // please rule out penumonia or mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new, ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung field.
 Differential includes small focus of pneumonia or less likely neoplasm. The
 ill-defined margins favor an infectious process, and it would be reasonable to
 treat for pneumonia with followup radiographs in 3 weeks to document
 resolution. If the opacity is still seen on followup radiographs, chest CT
 should be performed at that time. No other suspicious lesion is seen. There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung field, recommend empiric
 pneumonia treatment with followup radiographs in 3 weeks and chest CT if no
 resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. 
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 3:01 PM, 3 minutes after the
 discovery of the findings.
