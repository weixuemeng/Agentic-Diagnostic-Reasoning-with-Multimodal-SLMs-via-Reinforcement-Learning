 within the thoracic aorta.  Mild pulmonary edema is new compared to the
 previous study with small new bilateral pleural effusions demonstrated. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis however infection
 or aspiration is difficult to exclude.  More focal ill-defined mass in the
 left upper lobe was better characterized on the recent chest CT as consistent
 with lung malignancy.  No pneumothorax is present.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
