 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given AP

 prominent pericardial fat pad.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.
