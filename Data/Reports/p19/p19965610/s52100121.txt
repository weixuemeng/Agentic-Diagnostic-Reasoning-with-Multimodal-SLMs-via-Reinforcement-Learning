                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of right pleurodesis and Pleurx catheter.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___,
 most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been slight interval retraction of a right-sided chest
 tube which now projects over the mid right lung field.  The inferior chest
 tube projects over the lower lung.  Right-sided subcutaneous emphysema
 persists.  Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Large known upper
 lobe consolidation on the right appears similar to the prior exam with
 persistent mild right basilar atelectasis.  Mild plate-like atelectasis is
 seen at the left lung base; otherwise, the left lung is clear.  There is no
 interval change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Small
 right-sided pleural effusion is persistent.  The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax with persistent right basilar
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.
