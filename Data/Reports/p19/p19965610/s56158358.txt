                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 All of the right upper lobe is collapsed, a progression in atelectasis between
 ___ and ___, subsequently stable.  Previous small right pleural
 effusion has decreased.  Contours of the right hilus are partially obscured,
 but there has been no gross interval change.  Left lung and pleural space are
 relatively clear.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Reason for chest pain is not radiographically apparent.  In the setting of
 extensive malignancy, pericarditis and pulmonary embolism are not uncommon,
 but would not be apparent on conventional radiographs.
