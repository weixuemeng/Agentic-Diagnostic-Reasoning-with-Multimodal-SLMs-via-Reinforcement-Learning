 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pleural tapping.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion was

 effusion was removed.  The apical opacity due to the known lung malignancy
 with combined atelectasis is constant in appearance.
