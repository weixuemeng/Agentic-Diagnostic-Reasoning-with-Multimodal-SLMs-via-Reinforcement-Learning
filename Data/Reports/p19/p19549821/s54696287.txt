                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, similar to
 recent chest radiograph of ___, but slightly increased from the
 earlier radiograph of ___.  On the lateral chest radiograph,
 there are apparent small bilateral pleural effusions, new since ___.  Minimal adjacent basilar lung opacities are present.  The remainder of
 the lungs are clear except for unchanged relatively symmetrical bi-apical
 scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with minimal adjacent basilar
 lung opacities, which likely reflect atelectasis.  No definite pneumonia, but
 followup radiographs may be helpful if symptoms persist in order to exclude a
 subtle basilar pneumonia.
