 Left lower lobe opacity with blunting of the costophrenic angle and left
 hemidiaphragm overall similar to the prior exam, likely reflecting atelectasis
 and small left pleural effusion.  Dependent increased interstitial markings
 with indistinct assessed pulmonary vasculature is most suggestive of edema.
