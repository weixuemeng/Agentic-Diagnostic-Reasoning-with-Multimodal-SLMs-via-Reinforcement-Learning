                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M who had a bike accident today with pain on shoulder movement
 and point tenderness over clavicle.  Fracture?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Left clavicle radiographs from the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 clear without pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.Small
 well-circumscribed rounded lucency overlying the proximal left clavicle is
 possibly a small bone cyst.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of fracture.  However, chest radiograph is not an optimal method
 to evaluate the osseous structures.  If clinical concern remains, consider CT
 chest or bone enhanced views.
