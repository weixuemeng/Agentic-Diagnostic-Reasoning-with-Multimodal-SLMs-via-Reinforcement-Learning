                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion is demonstrated
 along with patchy opacities in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small left pleural effusion.  Patchy
 opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
