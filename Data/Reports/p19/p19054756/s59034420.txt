 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased.  Streaky
 opacities in the right lung base greater than the left are compatible with
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
