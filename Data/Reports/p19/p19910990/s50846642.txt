 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, question of resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the existing extensive
 right lung pneumonia has also almost completely resolved.  On today's
 radiograph, only faint and subtle remnant opacities are seen in the right
 upper lobe.  No other changes.  No reactive pleural effusions.  Normal size of
 the cardiac silhouette.
