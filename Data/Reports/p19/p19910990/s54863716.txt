 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 There are right middle and anterior segment of the right upper lobe involving
 confluent opacities with an oval component in the upper lobe consistent with
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal shilhouette and hila are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle and upper lobe pneumonia with widespread dense consolidation.
 
 Short-term follow-up chest radiographs are recommended within six weeks to

 high risk patient chest CT could also be considered preferably with
 intravenous contrast if that course is pursued.
