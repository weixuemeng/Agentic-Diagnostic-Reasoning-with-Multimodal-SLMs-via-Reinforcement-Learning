                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and slight indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting mild edema.  The heart size is difficult to fully assess in the
 setting of low lung volumes and is AP view and is probably normal in size.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is not widened.  No
 evidence of fractures on this nondedicated exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and minimal bronchovascular crowding and edema.
 2.  No focal pneumonia or pneumothorax.
