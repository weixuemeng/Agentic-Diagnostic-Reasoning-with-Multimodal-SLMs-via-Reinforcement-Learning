                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers and chills, assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are low in volume without focal consolidation.  No
 definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen; however, the left base is not well
 evaluated. The frontal view is unremarkable, though on the lateral a subtle
 basilar opacity or trace effusion cannot be fully excluded.  The heart is
 normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process but lateral view is suboptimal and
 a repeat lateral view with improved inspiration is recommended when the
 patient's clinical status allows.
