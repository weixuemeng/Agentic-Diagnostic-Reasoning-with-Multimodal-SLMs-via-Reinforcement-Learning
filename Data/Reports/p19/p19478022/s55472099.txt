                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p OLT ___  // eval R IJ CVL tip s/p cordis removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the right IJ line which had been seen as
 coiled over the right heart has been removed. A right IJ sheath or catheter is
 present, tip over mid/ distal SVC. There is a right subclavian PICC line, with
 tip over distal SVC.
 No pneumothorax is detected .
 
 Apparent ET tube, with tip approximately 5.0 cm above the carina. NG tube
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. The side port also extends
 beneath the GE junction.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No overt CHF. Some patchy opacity
 in the retrocardiac region is similar to the prior film. There is minimal
 subsegmental atelectasis at the left greater than right lung bases. The lungs
 are out otherwise grossly clear.  No effusions identified. The right
 hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, unchanged. Apparent artifactual ___ line
 along the right mediastinum and right heart border.
 
 Again seen are multiple drains and tubes over the right upper abdomen, with
 surgical ___, best correlated with details of the or relevant procedural
 history.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval removal of previously seen coiled right IJ line. Lines and tubes
 currently nominal in appearance.
 2. No pneumothorax detected.
 3. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 4. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with air bronchograms is
 similar to the film obtained earlier today.
