 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a
 chest CT performed the same day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, dyspnea, ascites, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is again noted.  There is bibasilar atelectasis again noted. 
 Metallic coils are noted in the right upper quadrant as well as small surgical
 clips.  There is no convincing sign of pneumonia or CHF.  A tiny right pleural
 effusion is better assessed on the same day chest CT scan.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits.  No bony
 abnormalities are seen.
