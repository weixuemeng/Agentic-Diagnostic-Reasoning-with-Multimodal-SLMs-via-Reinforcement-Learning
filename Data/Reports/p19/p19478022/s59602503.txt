                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cholangitis (now improving), c/o breathing
 difficulty s/p 13L fluid resuscitation  // extent of fluid overload in thorax
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.  Decreased extent of
 pulmonary edema with residual right perihilar opacity which could reflect
 resolving asymmetrical edema, or a secondary process such as aspiration or
 developing infectious pneumonia. Left retrocardiac opacity is slightly
 improved, and a left pleural effusion is no longer evident. Moderate right
 pleural effusion has a likely subpulmonic component.
