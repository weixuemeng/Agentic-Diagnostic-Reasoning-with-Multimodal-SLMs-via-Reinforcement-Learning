                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy, dementia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mild leftward deviation of the
 superior trachea is present, with right-sided superior mediastinal fullness,
 possibly attributable to an enlarged thyroid.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild
 retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis.  Degenerative changes of the
 acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with retrocardiac atelectasis.  
 
 Leftward deviation of the superior trachea with fullness of the right superior
 mediastinum could suggest the presence of enlarged right thyroid gland. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
