                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Outside hospital PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion has substantially decreased in extent.  However, a plate-like
 atelectasis is present on the right and minimal atelectasis is also seen on
 the left lung bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The patient carries a right-sided
 PICC line.  The tip of the line projects over the right atrium, the line could
 be pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm to ensure position in the mid to
 lower SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
