                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with spinal fusion.  Rule out pneumothorax,
 status post chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 513.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line, endotracheal
 tube and left chest tube.  A right PICC line remains in place with its tip in
 the distal SVC.  Spinal hardware continues to overlie the thoracic spine.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished, and there is
 increasing perihilar vascular indistinctness likely representing appearance of
 mild perihilar edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
