 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right subclavian catheter terminates in the lower superior
 vena cava adjacent to the junction with the right atrium.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits for technique.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are grossly clear allowing
 for incomplete imaging of the right costophrenic angle.
