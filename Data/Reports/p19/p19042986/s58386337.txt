 barotrauma      evaluate for barotrauma
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ at 4:28.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is new substantial opacification at both lung bases, probably a
 combination of moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is now engorged, but I do not believe there is pulmonary
 edema.  Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable except for slight interval decrease in mediastinal venous engorgement.
 Tracheostomy tube midline.  Right subclavian catheter tip in the region of the
 superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
