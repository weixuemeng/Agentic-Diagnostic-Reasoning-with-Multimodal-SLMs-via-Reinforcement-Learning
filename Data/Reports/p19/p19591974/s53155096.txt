                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status x4 days, ___'s s/p
 deep-brain stimulator  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lung bases are partially obscured by overlying pulse generator devices
 bilaterally.  There is no pneumothorax.  Opacity at the left lung base most
 likely represents atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is also subtle opacification of the left
 apex, which may represent pleural scarring.  No large pleural effusions are
 seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Patient is kyphotic. No acute osseous
 abnormalities are identified.  Surgical clips are seen in the epigastric
 region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Left lung base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large
 pleural effusions.
