 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural
 effusions have minimally increased in extent.  Also increasing are the
 bilateral subsequent basal atelectases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette
 continues to be enlarged.  In the well ventilated parts of the lungs, there is
 no evidence of pneumonia.
