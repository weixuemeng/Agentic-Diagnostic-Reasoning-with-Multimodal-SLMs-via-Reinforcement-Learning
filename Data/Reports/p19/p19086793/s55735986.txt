 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement.

 Heart size and mediastinum appear to be stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted, small to moderate, mildly decreased since the prior study.  Minimal
 apical pneumothorax on the left is present, better appreciated on the current
 study as compared to prior examination.  No evidence of pulmonary edema is
 seen.  The sternotomy wires appear unremarkable.
