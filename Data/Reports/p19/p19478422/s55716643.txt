                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:46 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, cough and shortness of breath and sore throat.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural abnormality.  A frontal bedside
 chest radiograph is not the ideal way to look for pneumonia.  I would strongly
 recommend conventional chest radiographs for areas that are poorly evaluated
 by this study, such as the lung apices and lung bases.
