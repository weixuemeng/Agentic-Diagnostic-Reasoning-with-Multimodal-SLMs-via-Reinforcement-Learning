                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presyncope and malaise, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is seen coursing along
 the lower left neck across the left hemithorax towards the abdomen.  A
 slightly rounded nodular airspace opacity projects over the lower lobe on the
 lateral view and may represent an infectious process.  Rounded atelectasis is
 not excluded.  The right lung is relatively clear.  Trace pleural fluid layers
 posteriorly on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. 
 There is prominence of the mediastinum due to unfolding of the thoracic aorta,
 which is unchanged.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Rounded nodular airspace opacity in the lower lobe concerning for
 infectious process.  Followup PA and lateral radiographs are recommended in
 six to eight weeks following appropriate therapy to confirm resolution.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
