                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with trach, hypoxic  // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Again seen is the tracheostomy tube.  Compared with ___, there is
 new patchy opacity at the base of the right upper zone and at the right lung
 base, with less pronounced  patchy opacity extending toward the right lung
 apex.   There is pleural fluid and/or thickening in the right costophrenic
 angle and extending along the right chest wall, that is similar to the prior
 study.  In addition, there is new thickening of the right minor fissure which
 could represent pleural fluid extending along the minor fissure.  As before,
 the right hemidiaphragm is likely elevated.
 
 Allowing for rotation, the mediastinum remains grossly midline.  The
 mediastinum appears prominent, though this is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes and rotation.  Heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.
 
 In the left lung, there is minimal upper zone redistribution and minimal
 atelectasis linear atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base.  The extreme
 left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross left effusion
 is identified.
 
 There is background osteopenia.  Incidental note is made of severe left
 glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy opacity in much of the right lung, most pronounced at the base of
 the right upper lobe and at the right base.   Although non-specific, the
 appearance is concerning for multifocal pneumonic infiltrate.  Asymmetric CHF
 could have a similar appearance, but is considered unlikely given the absence
 of significant findings in the left lung.
 
 New thickened appearance of the right minor fissure suggests fluoro fluid
 layering along the minor fissure.
