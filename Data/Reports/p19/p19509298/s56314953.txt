                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with post-surgical wound infection and chills,
 evaluate for a pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright views of the chest were obtained.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Chronic bibasilar opacities more
 severe on the right have slightly increased, likely representing worsening
 atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased opacification at the right base is probably
 related to worsening atelectasis as chronically seen in that region; however,
 developing consolidation cannot be excluded.
