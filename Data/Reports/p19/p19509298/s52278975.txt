                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and cough, chronic trach  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated.  The left costophrenic angle not fully included on the
 image.  Midline tracheostomy tube is seen.  The right hemidiaphragm remains
 elevated and there is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle. 
 Right base atelectasis/scarring is seen.  Overall, the right lung is again
 seen to be volume than the left.  No definite focal consolidation is seen on
 the left.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. The
 bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient rotated.  Left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. 
 Midline tracheostomy tube.
 
 Right hemi diaphragm remains elevated and there is persistent blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle.  Right base atelectasis/ scarring again seen; right
 base opacity is increased as compared to the prior study which could be due to
 increased atelectasis, however, underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude.
