                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // s/p bronch
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compare with ___ at 11:18 (earlier the same day), there has been
 interval improvement in the appearance of the right lung.  The area of dense
 thickening seen along the expected course of the minor fissure is
 significantly improved, though it remains partially visible, suggesting
 interval re-expansion of portions of the right lung.
 
 Patchy opacity however remains visible in the aerated portions of the right
 lung.  The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, with blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, and a small amount of pleural thickening along the right
 chest wall on the lung apex.  The right paratracheal soft tissue density
 remains thickened.
 
 As before, the cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline and appears
 overall unchanged.  The right hilum, as before, is obscured by surrounding
 opacities.
 
 Also, as before, left lung remains grossly clear, without CHF focal
 consolidation or effusion.  Minimal atelectasis is now noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the degree of aeration of the right lung.
 
 Background patchy opacities remain visible throughout much of the aerated
 portion of the right lung.  The most likely differential are pneumonic
 infiltrates, extensive aspiration, or asymmetric CHF, but other etiologies
 cannot be excluded.
 
 The left lung remains grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis at the base.
