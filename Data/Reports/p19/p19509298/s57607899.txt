 // ? worsening pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated distorting the appearance of the right thoracic cage. 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Right lower hemithorax opacity
 with silhouetting of the right heart border is consistent with a combination
 of a small pleural effusion, atelectasis, and residual but improved
 consolidation from infection.  No pneumothorax.  Asymmetric edema and
 pulmonary vascular engorgement on the prior exam in the right lung has
 markedly improved.  No frank pulmonary edema.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement
 is now more symmetric and minimal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent but markedly improved pneumonia.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 3.  Improved edema and bronchovascular engorgement, now minimal in more
 symmetric.
