 INDICATION:   ___M with AMS, hypoxia  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased opacity at the right lung base.  Some of this could be due
 to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm although subpulmonic effusion is
 possible.  Patchy adjacent consolidation is also noted.  Left lung is grossly
 clear noting motion which obscures fine detail.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity which could a component of sub pulmonic effusion or
 elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Adjacent parenchymal opacities which could
 represent a combination of atelectasis, aspiration and/or infection.
