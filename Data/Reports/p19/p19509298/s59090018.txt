                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with end stage MS ___/p trach and peg with RL
 consolidation on admission  // Change in R lung opacification
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy is again noted.  The overall appearance is quite similar,
 though slight differences are present on both sides.  On the right, there is
 slight difference in distribution of right lung opacities.  In particular, the
 previous seen dense platelike opacity in the right mid/lower zone is no longer
 visualized and may have resolved.  The small right pleural effusion is similar
 in appearance.  In the left lung, there is upper zone redistribution.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity is slightly more pronounced with new partial obscuration
 left hemidiaphragm and suggested left lower lobe air bronchograms.   On the
 left, mild upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected very slight improvement in opacities in the right infrahilar region.
 Slight worsening of collapse/consolidation at the left lung base.  On the
 left, mild upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora.
