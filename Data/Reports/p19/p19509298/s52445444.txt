  1. Probable bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions,
  however, left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
  setting.  Limited portable study.
  2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with fever and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is leftward rotation of the patient current radiograph. Tracheostomy
 tube is again seen in grossly appropriate position. Allowing for differences
 in technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There are low
 lung volumes and a sub-optimal inspiratory effort. Right lower lung and
 retrocardiac opacities likely represent basilar atelectasis, however,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are likely still present.  Central hilar prominence may
 represent mild pulmonary vascular congestion without evidence of frank
 pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions,
 however, left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
