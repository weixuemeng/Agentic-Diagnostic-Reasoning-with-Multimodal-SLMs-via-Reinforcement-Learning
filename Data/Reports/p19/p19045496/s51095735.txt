                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and altered mental status, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact
 appearing sternal wires.  Mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with prior
 CABG surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, increased from the
 prior study of ___, which may be in part related to AP technique.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is minimal
 calcification of the aortic knob.  The inspiratory lung volumes are
 appropriate.  Likely bibasilar atelectasis, early infection not excluded in
 appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Healed right rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac silhouette increased in size compared to prior study from
 ___.  Likely bibasilar atelectasis, early infection not excluded in
 appropriate clinical setting.
