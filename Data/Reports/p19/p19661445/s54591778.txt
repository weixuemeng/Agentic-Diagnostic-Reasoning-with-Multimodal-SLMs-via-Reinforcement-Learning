                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new onset afib, dyspnea on exertion  // Assess
 for infiltrates, effusion, or evidence of pulmonary congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes
 and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is patchy right mid lung
 opacity may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Left base opacity may be due to combination of
 the large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis.  Overall, there appears to
 be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right mid lung opacity may be due to atelectasis but pneumonia is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Left base opacity most likely due to combination of large hiatal hernia with
 adjacent atelectasis.
 
 Low lung volumes, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, and possible mild
 vascular congestion.
