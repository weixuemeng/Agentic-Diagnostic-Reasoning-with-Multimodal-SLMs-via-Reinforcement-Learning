 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Lung biopsies for possible sarcoid, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Moderate scoliosis with subsequent
 asymmetry of the rib cage.  Bilateral perihilar and bilateral basal opacities,
 some of which are likely atelectatic.  There is no safe evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
