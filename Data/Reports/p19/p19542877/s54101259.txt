                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Lung volumes are
 low. Opacities in the lingula suggest pneumonia in the appropriate setting.
 Elsewhere, the lungs are probably clear although it is difficult to exclude
 vague additional area of possible infection in the left lower lobe. Elsewhere
 the lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Bones
 appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity in the left lower lung, probably for the most part in the
 lingula, concerning for possible pneumonia in the appropriate setting.
