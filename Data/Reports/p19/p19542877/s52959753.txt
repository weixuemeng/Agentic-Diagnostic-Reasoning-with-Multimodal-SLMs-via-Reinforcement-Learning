  Increased size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely related to
  technique.  Again seen, is moderate tracheal compromise by a large goiter,
  with deviation to the left.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity seen on
  lateral view, which may represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. 
  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is likely a background of
  mild interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachycardia, hypotension  // pls eval for
 PNA, evidence of infection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the massive right-sided goiter,
 causing deviation of the trachea to the left, is again visualized.  The lung
 volumes are overall normal.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion.  A subtle retrocardiac opacity, seen on
 the lateral radiograph only, might represent pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
