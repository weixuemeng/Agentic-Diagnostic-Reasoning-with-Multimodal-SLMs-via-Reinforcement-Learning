                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity swelling.  Evaluate for left heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable upright chest radiograph.  Relative lucency of the bilateral
 upper lungs suggests background emphysematous changes.  Bibasilar
 opacifications identified, left greater than right. Right-sided opacification
 may merely represent crowding and atelectasis; however, more dense
 opacification on the left may reflect atelectasis, combined with small
 effusion versus developing pneumonia. Please note, the lung apices are
 excluded from view by the patient's overlying chin.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacification, left greater than right.  On the left, the
 opacifications may represent atelectasis with small effusion or developing
 pneumonia.  Background emphysematous changes.
