                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with advanced dementia now with new fever.
 Concern for aspiration PNA.  // Pls evaluate for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ targeted review of chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 There is rotated positioning.  Probable background COPD.  Mild cardiomegaly,
 with calcified slightly unfolded aorta.  There is slight upper zone
 redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF.  There is atelectasis the left lung
 base, without definite consolidation.  No gross left effusion.  There is hazy
 obscuration of the right lung base raising the question of a small effusion
 and/or atelectasis.  No definite consolidation.
 
 Due to patient rotation, the previously seen large right-sided thyroid mass,
 possibly a goiter, which compresses and displaces the trachea,  is less well
 delineated, but probably similar to the prior study.
 
 Known recent fracture of the left anterior second rib is not well depicted
 radiographically.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacity at the right lung base may represent a combination of a small
 amount of pleural fluid and/or atelectasis.  Some patchy retrocardiac opacity
 is also present.  No definite consolidation is identified at either lung base,
 though an early infiltrate would be difficult to completely exclude in either
 location.
 
 Doubt focal consolidation in the mid or upper zones.  Hazy opacity in the
 right paratracheal .  Region is from double with the previously demonstrated
 large right thyroid mass, question goiter.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and and COPD.
 
 Mild vascular plethora, but doubt overt CHF.
 
 Known left anterior second rib fracture not well visualized.
