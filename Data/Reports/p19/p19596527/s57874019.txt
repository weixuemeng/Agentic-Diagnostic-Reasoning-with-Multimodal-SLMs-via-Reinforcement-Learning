                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p CABG  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 09:49
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the right atrium common similar prior.
 
 Status post sternotomy.  Mild prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette
 overall similar to the prior study.  As before, the right hilum is somewhat
 prominent.  There is platelike atelectasis in both lower zones similar to
 prior, slightly more pronounced on the left.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with mild CHF.
 
 There is a new small to moderate left pleural effusion with increased
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle and minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base, without gross effusion.
 
 Advanced osteoarthritis of both glenohumeral joints again noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspect slight interval increase in CHF.
 
 Increased opacity left base, consisting of increased left pleural effusion and
 increased retrocardiac density, compatible with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, without gross right
 effusion.  Minimal patchy atelectasis at the right lung base is similar to
 prior
