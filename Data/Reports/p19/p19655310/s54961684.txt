                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease secondary to SLE,
 starting dialysis.  This is a pre-procedure chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  A dialysis catheter ends in the
 mid SVC.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
