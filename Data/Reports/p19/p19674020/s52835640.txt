 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with rising white count and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The patient
 is slightly rotated. Slightly increased left lower lobe opacity since ___
 in the setting of unchanged left pleural effusion may represent an early or
 developing pneumonia rather than atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Heart
 size is normal.  Increased density adjacent to the right paratracheal stripe
 is likely due to lymphadenopathy seen on chest CT ___.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous with aortic knob calcifications, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slightly increased left lower lobe opacity since ___ in the
 setting of unchanged left pleural effusion may represent an early or
 developing pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
