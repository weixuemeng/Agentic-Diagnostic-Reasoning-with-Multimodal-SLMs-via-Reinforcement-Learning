                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, effusions and pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is partially obscured by the lung abnormalities.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are stable. 
 Right lower lobe opacity has increased, could be due to increasing
 atelectasis.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.  Right mild lung opacity has
 increased, consistent with worsening infection. Diffuse irregular interstitial
 opacities are grossly unchanged.
