                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, status post CABG, status post chest tube
 removals.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tubes have been removed since yesterday.  A
 right-sided internal jugular catheter remains at the cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Lung volumes are low.  Right hilar opacity has
 increased since 7:50 a.m.  Sternal wires are intact.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax, status post left-sided chest tube removal. 
 Increased right hilar opacity reflects some combination of increasing
 atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
