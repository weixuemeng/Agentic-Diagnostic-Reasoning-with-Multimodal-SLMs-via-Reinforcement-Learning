                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, status post bypass surgery and stent
 placement, evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy and evidence of previous bypass
 surgery.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present.  Thoracic aorta is of
 ordinary ___ but shows rather extensive calcifications in the wall at
 the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature does not show any upper zone
 redistribution, interstitial alveolar edema, but bilateral moderate amounts of
 pleural effusions are still present and blunt the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses.  There is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates of pneumonic nature.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical
 area on the frontal view.  When comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___, the at that time observed
 perivascular haze has regressed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving and lesser marked pulmonary congestion but still
 remaining bilateral pleural effusions and the presence of moderate cardiac
 enlargement in patient status post sternotomy and bypass surgery.  Further
 dehydration measures are recommended and followup examination may be helpful.
