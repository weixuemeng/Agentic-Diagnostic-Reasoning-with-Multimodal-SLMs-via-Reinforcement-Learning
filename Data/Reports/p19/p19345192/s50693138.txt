                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient with
 dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an unchanged mildly enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Again seen are ill-defined reticular
 interstitial markings, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Opacity
 projecting over the lower thoracic spine on lateral view could represent a
 left lower lobe pneumonia.  There are likely bilateral trace pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity which could represent left lower lobe pneumonia.  Likely
 bilateral trace pleural effusions.  Mild pulmonary edema, increased compared
 to ___.
