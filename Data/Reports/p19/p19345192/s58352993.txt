                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new dyspnea and rapid atrial flutter
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contour similar.  Mild pulmonary edema is worse in the interval.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged with prominence of the pulmonary artery suggestive of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension, as seen previously.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.  Osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions, worse from the
 previous study.
