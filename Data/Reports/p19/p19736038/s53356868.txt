                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of asthma, now with diffuse
 wheezing and rhonchi on physical exam, here to evaluate for acute pulmonary
 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show increased
 opacification at the right lung base obscuring the right heart border, best
 appreciated on the corresponding lateral radiograph representing right middle
 lobe collapse.  Linear opacities at the left lung base are new from the
 preceding radiographs and most likely represent atelectasis in the absence of
 clinical findings to suggest infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits and probably unchanged from the ___
 radiograph, although the heart borders are obscured by adjacent opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe collapse and atelectasis at the left lung base
 secondary to asthma, less likely pneumonia or other infection.
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ by phone at
 17:00 p.m. on ___.
