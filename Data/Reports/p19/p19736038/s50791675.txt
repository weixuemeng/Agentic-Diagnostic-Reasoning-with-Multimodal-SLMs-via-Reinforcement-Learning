                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p vats decortication, s/p chest tube pull.
 r/o pneumothorax.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of the prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, interval removal of the left-sided chest
 tubes, with a small left apical pneumothorax.  Moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion and left basilar consolidation, likely due to atelectasis, are
 unchanged.  Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 has improved.  Mediastinum is stable.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Small
 amount of subcutaneous air on the left side, likely related to the prior chest
 tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small left apical pneumothorax, post chest tube removal.
 
 2.  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion.
