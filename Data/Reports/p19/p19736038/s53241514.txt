 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left loculated pleural effusion.  //
 Evaluate interval change in chest tube, left pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left chest tube is unchanged in positioning.  The size and distribution of
 the moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion is unchanged.  The right
 lung is clear.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The upper mediastinum is
 stable in size, however the cardiac silhouette cannot be entirely evaluated
 due to the pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The linear
 radiodensity projecting over the left mid lung is likely external to the
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged positioning of left chest tube.
 2. Stable moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion.
