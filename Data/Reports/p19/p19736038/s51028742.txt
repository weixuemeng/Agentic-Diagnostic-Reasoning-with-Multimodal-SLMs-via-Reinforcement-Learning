                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o PNA with empyema s/p left VATS
 decortication  // Eval for consolidation, effusion      Eval for
 consolidation, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Loculations have decreased substantially.  Lateral view shows a nodular
 opacity projecting over the upper vertebral canal.  This could be local
 pleural thickening, but CT scanning would be required to exclude a lung
 nodule.  The hilar contours reflect previously documented central adenopathy. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CT for possible lung nodule.
