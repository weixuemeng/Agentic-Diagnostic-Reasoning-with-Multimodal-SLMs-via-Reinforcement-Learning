                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count with PICC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously noted right upper extremity PICC line has apparently
 been removed and replaced with a left upper extremity approach PICC line.  The
 distal tip of the line is projecting well within the right atrium.  Retraction
 by at least 6 to 7 cm is advised for placement at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Lung volumes are profoundly diminished with hazy opacity at the
 lung bases, likely reflecting atelectasis.  In addition, there is likely fluid
 tracking within the right major fissure.  There are bilateral pleural
 effusions.  A subpulmonic component, particularly on the right cannot be
 excluded, resulting in the appearance of an elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no consolidation or edema.  Mild aortic
 tortuosity is accentuated by low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits for size.  The osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line as above.  Consider retracting 6 to 7 cm for optimal
 placement.  Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
