                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 A radiograph centered in the upper abdomen was obtained for assessment of the
 location of a tip of a nasogastric tube.  The nasogastric tube terminates in
 the region of the distal stomach.  A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is
 visualized.  Please note that the entirety of the chest was not included on
 the study, and a substantial proportion of the upper lobes and upper
 mediastinum have been excluded from the radiograph.  Within the imaged portion
 of the chest, the cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, and
 the aorta is tortuous.  Left-sided pleural calcifications are present
 suggesting pleural plaques, and there is also either a small pleural effusion
 or pleural thickening at the right lateral costophrenic sulcus.  When the
 patient's condition permits, a standard chest radiograph is recommended for
 more complete evaluation of the thorax.
