 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 moderate interstitial abnormality is a finding that could be seen with severe
 airway inflammation, atypical pneumonia or possibly pulmonary edema, although
 without specific signs of the latter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate interstitial abnormality which is not specific but could
 be seen with reactive airway disease as clinically suspected.
