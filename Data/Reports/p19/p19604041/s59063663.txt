                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in left upper lobe collapse in a
 previously intubated patient.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed. Compared to
 the most recent study the left lung has totally collapsed and the small right
 basilar atelectasis has increased.  The amount of pleural effusion is
 difficult to evaluate given the lung abnormalities.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is partially obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormality.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  A transverse non-displaced linear fracture in
 the right median scapula has been present since ___.  The known left
 scapular fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Total left lung collapse and increased small right basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Non-displaced fracture of the right median scapula has been present since
 ___
