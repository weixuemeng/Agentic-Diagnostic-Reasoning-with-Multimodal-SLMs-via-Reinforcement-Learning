                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is new collapse of the left lower lobe.  There is also increased
 atelectasis in the lingula and left upper lobe.  Right lower lobe atelectasis
 has increased.  The amount of pleural effusion is difficult to evaluate given
 the lung abnormalities.  Cardiomediastinal contour is partially obscured by
 the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 In the field of view, no ET tube is demonstrated.
