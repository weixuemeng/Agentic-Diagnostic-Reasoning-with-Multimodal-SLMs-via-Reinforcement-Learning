                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, presenting with
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A dialysis
 catheter terminates in the upper right atrium.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is very mild pulmonary congestion with
 interstitial changes at the lung bases and mild perihilar congestion but not
 highly striking and not nearly as severe as on prior presentation.  On the
 prior chest CT discrete nodules were identified.  These are not well assessed
 with this technique.  Accordingly, if no other intervention is planned
 short-term follow-up CT should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Nodules seen on prior CT not
 well assessed; persistent nodules cannot be excluded.
