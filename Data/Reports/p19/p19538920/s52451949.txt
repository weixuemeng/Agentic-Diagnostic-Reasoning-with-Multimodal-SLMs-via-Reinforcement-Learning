 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette appears increased compared to the previous radiograph. 
 There is increased perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible
 with mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval.  More focal opacity in the
 left lung base could reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure.  More focal patchy left basilar opacity may
 reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded completely.
