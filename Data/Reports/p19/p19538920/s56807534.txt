                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman shortness of breath since hemodialysis in the
 afternoon.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Lung volumes remain slightly low. 
 Mild left greater than right edema.  Heart size is probably still enlarged
 despite lower lung volumes and AP projection.  No large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  Aortic knob calcifications are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of mild volume overload with likely asymmetrical edema
 pattern.  Superimposed infection in the left lung cannot be excluded, and
 short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
