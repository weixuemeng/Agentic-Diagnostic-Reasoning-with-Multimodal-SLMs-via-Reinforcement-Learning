 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:24 PM
  Mild interstitial edema, slightly increased compared to prior, although this
  may be exaggerated by lower lung volumes.  Increased opacification of the left
  lower lung field, possibly secondary to focal consolidation.  The right lung
  base is not well evaluated due to elevated right hemidiaphragm and low lung
  volumes without lateral view.  Discussed with ___ by phone at
  17:22 on ___ at the time of wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe opacity, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased and the size of the cardiac silhouette has increased.  Areas of
 non-characteristic opacities are seen at both the left and the right lung
 bases.  The extent and distribution of the changes favors atelectasis over
 pneumonia.  In addition, there are signs of vascular distention and blood flow
 re-distribution, suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No larger
 effusions are seen.  Patient has undergone sternotomy.
