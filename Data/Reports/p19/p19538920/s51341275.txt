                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.  History of diverticulitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The patient is
 status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The heart is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Hazy
 predominantly central opacification suggests mild fluid overload, and streaky
 new right basilar opacities can probably be attributed atelectasis.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No free air identified.  Findings suggest mild fluid overload and minor right
 basilar atelectasis.
