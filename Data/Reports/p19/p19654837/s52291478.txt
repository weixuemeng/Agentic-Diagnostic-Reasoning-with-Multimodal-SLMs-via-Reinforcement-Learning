 HISTORY:  Left upper lobectomy.  Persistent left hemopneumothorax.  Worsening
 dyspnea after chest tube pulled.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large left hydropneumothorax has a relatively stable anterior component
 occupying most of previous location of the resected right upper lobe, but now
 there is a subpulmonic component, which is increasing.  Allowing for
 differences in patient position in the extent of mild rightward and
 mediastinal shift, it probably has not changed.  Right lung is clear.  Dr.
 ___ was paged.
