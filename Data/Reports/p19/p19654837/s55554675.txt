                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:37 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since dense consolidation in the right lung improved on ___,
 ground-glass opacification through most of the right lung has remained
 relatively stable, although there may be new consolidation at the right lung
 base.  I am not sure what these findings mean, but it is probably an extension
 of the process in the right lower lung seen on chest CT scan ___.
 Perhaps it is pulmonary drug toxicity or desquamative interstitial pneumonia. 
 Radiation fibrosis in the left upper lung, following left upper lobectomy, has
 stabilized, showing some clearing since it is most severe consolidation on
 ___.  The lower portion of left lung is the only normal lung region.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no
 less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced between 3 and 4 cm for
 more secured seating and better aeration.  Nasogastric tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.  Heart size indeterminate, probably not significantly
 enlarged.  Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 No pneumothorax.
