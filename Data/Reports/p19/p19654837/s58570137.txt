 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The stomach appears distended with gas. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Improved aeration of the left lung with decreased atelectasis and effusion.
 
 2. The stomach appears distended with gas. Clinical correlation is
 recommended.
