                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:24 A.M. ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Lobectomy for lung cancer.  Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Variability in the density of right apical consolidation, decreased yesterday,
 increased again today would suggest differing degrees of deposition of edema. 
 Overall, the severity of consolidation in the right lung has improved over the
 past few days.  Left lower lung is clear.  Left upper lung is chronically
 atelectatic.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no
 less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced 3 cm for more secured
 seating.  A right jugular line can be traced as far as the low SVC but the tip
 is indistinct.  No pneumothorax.
