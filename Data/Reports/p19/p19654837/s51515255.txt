                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Worsening hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 5 hours earlier.
 
 There appears to be increase in left pleural effusion that is loculated in the
 left apex.  Otherwise, there are no interval changes.  No pneumothorax or
 overt pulmonary edema.  Extensive pneumonic consolidations in the right lung
 are unchanged.  Evidence of left upper lobe resection, elevation of the left
 hilum and cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
