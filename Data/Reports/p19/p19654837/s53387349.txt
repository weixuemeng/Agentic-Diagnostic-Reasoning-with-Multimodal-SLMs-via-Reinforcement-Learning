 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips in the left hilus and at the left costophrenic angle are

 apical region, although it is stable compared to prior study.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The right lung is clear.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Suspected elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected post left lobectomy changes without evidence of
 complication.
