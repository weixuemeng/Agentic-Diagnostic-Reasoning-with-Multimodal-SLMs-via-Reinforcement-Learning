                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 HISTORY:  Left thoracotomy and upper lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to first postoperative chest
 radiograph, ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema has resolved.  A large air and fluid collection fills the
 space in the anterior left hemithorax vacated by the resected upper lobe. 
 Lateral view shows only one left pleural drain, posterior to the lower lobe. 
 There is also distortion of the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view which
 could be due to adjacent pleural fluid.  On the frontal view, the fluid in the
 lobectomy space obscures the left heart border.  Mediastinum is mildly widened
 but unchanged, still shifted slightly to the right.  Right lung is clea
 
 Dr.___ ___ I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.
