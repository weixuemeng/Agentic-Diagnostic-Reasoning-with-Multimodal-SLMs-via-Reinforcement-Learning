                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate extent of pneumonia, patient with history of
 non-small cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study chest x-ray ___ and CT of ___.
 
 Extensive mainly peripheral lung opacities in the right lung have markedly
 worsened in the right lower lobe.  These are consistent with multifocal
 pneumonia.  
 
 Cardiomediatinal silhouette, evidence of left upper lobe resection, multiple
 surgical clips in the left hilum, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, left
 apical opacities and left apical pleural effusion are all unchanged.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
