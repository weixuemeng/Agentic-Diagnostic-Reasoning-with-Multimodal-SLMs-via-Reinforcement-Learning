                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman intubated, evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.6 cm above the carina with the
 patient's neck flexed and should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm for
 optimal placement.  NG tube is subdiaphragmatic.  Heart is normal size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low and mild
 basilar atelectasis is noted. Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Endotracheal tube is too low and should be pulled back by 1 cm for optimal
 placement.
