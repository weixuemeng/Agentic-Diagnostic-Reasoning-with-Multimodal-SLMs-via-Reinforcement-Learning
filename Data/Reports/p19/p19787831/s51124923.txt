                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 8.3 cm above the carina, at the upper border of
 the clavicular heads.  NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. 
 Left subclavian central line tip overlies  the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 Suspect background COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone
 redistribution.  Minimal patchy opacity at the right base and retrocardiac
 region is seen, similar to prior film.  No frank consolidation and no effusion
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis and are unchanged.  An early
 right base infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude, but no frank
 consolidation is identified.
 
 2.  No CHF.
 
 3.  ET tube at upper edge of clavicles.  Clinical correlation regarding
 possible advancement is requested.
