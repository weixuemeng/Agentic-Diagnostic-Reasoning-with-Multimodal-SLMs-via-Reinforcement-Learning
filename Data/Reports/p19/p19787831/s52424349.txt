 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Intubated patient.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 about 5 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian venous catheter terminates in
 the superior vena cava.  An orogastric tube courses through the stomach.  The
 left costophrenic sulcus is excluded.  There is some question of mild
 congestion, noting cuffed airways and slight interstitial prominence.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps slight pulmonary congestion.  Unchanged lines, tubes, and
 drains.
