                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right pleural effusion and
 trapped lung physiology.  Status post thoracocentesis, evaluate for possible
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  During the interval,
 right-sided thoracocentesis was performed.  The massive right-sided pleural
 density as identified on the previous examination has decreased moderately. 
 Still the remaining pleural effusion obliterates totally the right-sided
 hemidiaphragm and reaches along the right-sided lateral chest wall.  After the
 thoracocentesis, there is no evidence of any hydropneumothorax in the right
 hemithorax.  Left-sided pulmonary changes which include a plate atelectasis in
 the left lung base remain unchanged.  No new abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked reduction of right-sided pleural effusion after
 thoracocentesis, no pneumothorax.
