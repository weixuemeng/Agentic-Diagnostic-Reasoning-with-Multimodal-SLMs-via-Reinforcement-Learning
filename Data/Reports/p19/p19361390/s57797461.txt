                                 FINAL REPORT

 medical history and multiple tubes and lines.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tubes and lines are in unchanged position.  There is unchanged left lower lobe
 opacity, potentially representing infectious process although atelectasis is a
 more likely possibility.  Right pleural effusion in a patient after
 decortication is unchanged as well as the right mid and lower lung areas of
 atelectasis.
