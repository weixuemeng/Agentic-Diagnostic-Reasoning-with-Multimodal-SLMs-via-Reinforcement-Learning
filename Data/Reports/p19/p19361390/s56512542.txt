                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is a
 moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion.  There is also likely right
 middle and lower lobe atelectasis.  Linear opacity at the left lung base
 suggestive of atelectasis and there is suggestion of left apical calcified
 granulomas, but there is no confluent consolidation or left effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Hypertrophic changes
 are seen in the spine.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest
 prior cholecystectomy.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with components of
 middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
