                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Compared with prior, there has been interval improvement
 in aeration at the right lung base with more clear delineation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There is persistent increased opacity in the left hemithorax
 with associated volume loss on this side, similar to CT scan from ___.  There is persistent obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not changed.  Dual-lead pacing device is
 again noted as is a tracheostomy tube.  Subluxation of the glenohumeral joints
 is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improved aeration at the right lung base.  Persistent
 increased opacity involving majority of the left hemithorax silhouetting the
 left hemidiaphragm with likely volume loss.  Overall, the findings have not
 significantly changed on the left since prior noting that infection cannot be
 excluded.  Please clinically correlate regarding the need for additional
 imaging.
