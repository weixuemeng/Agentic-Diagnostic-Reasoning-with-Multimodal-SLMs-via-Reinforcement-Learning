 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Ventilator-dependent fevers, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube in situ.  The patient also has a right subclavian
 vein catheter, the tip of the catheter projects over the upper SVC.
 
 The patient has received a left pectoral pacemaker, the course and position of
 the leads is unremarkable.
 
 In the interval, the patient has developed a volume loss of the left lung,
 associated to a diffuse fibrotic process and pleural thickening.  In addition,
 a parenchymal opacity at the right upper lobe base is seen.  This opacity
 might be more recent and infectious in origin.
 
 The heart continues to be mildly enlarged.  Mild fluid overload is present.
 
 The parenchymal processes, if clinically relevant, could be further evaluated
 by CT.
