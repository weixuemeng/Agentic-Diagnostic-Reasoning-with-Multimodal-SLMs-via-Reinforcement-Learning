                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hematocrit drop.  Please evaluate for OG tube
 location.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 FINDINGS:  An OG tube is seen coursing into the proximal portion of the
 stomach.  Tracheostomy tube is in stable position.  Right subclavian catheter
 terminates in low SVC.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is similar to the
 prior exams and a retrocardiac opacity is stable and compatible with
 atelectasis although infection can have a similar appearance.  While the
 extremely low lung volumes particularly on the left are largely unchanged,
 there is a worsening left upper lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration
 versus atelectasis.
