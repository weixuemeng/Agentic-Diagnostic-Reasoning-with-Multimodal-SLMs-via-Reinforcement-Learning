                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with  cough, dyspnea crackls on right-sided, rule out
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is subtle opacity in
 the medial right and left lung base which is similar to prior and may
 represent crowding of bronchovascular markings though the possibility of a
 subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent bronchovascular markings versus early pneumonia at the medial lung
 bases.
