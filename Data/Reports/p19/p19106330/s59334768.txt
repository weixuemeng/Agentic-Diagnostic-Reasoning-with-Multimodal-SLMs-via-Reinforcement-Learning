                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds at right base,
 history of pulmonary fibrosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are markedly low
 limiting assessment.  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged which could
 reflect known prominent epicardial fat pads.  In this patient with known
 interstitial lung disease, there are prominent reticular markings in the
 periphery of both lungs likely reflecting interval progression in fibrosis. 
 Difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No overt edema or congestion.  Mediastinal contour is normal. 
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary fibrosis, likely progressed in the interval.  Difficult to exclude a
 superimposed pneumonia.
