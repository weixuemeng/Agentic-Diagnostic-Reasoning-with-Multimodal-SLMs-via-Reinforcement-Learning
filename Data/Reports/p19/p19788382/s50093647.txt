                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aortic knob remains
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Moderate size left
 pleural effusion appears minimally increased compared to the prior study. 
 Opacification of the left lung base likely is due to compressive atelectasis. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears similar.  Trace right pleural
 effusion is relatively unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in size of moderate left pleural effusion.  Left
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Trace right pleural effusion
 also noted.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar compared to the prior
 study.
