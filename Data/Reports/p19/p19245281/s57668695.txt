 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are largely clear.  At the
 right lung base there is prominence of the bronchovascular structures and
 peribronchial thickening which may relate to an infectious process such as
 bronchitis.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural abnormality.
