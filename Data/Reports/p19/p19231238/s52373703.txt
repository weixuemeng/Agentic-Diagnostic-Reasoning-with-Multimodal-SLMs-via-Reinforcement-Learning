                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with difficulty breathing  // Eval for infiltrate,
 increasing effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated ___ through ___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Interval increase in size of the
 bilateral pleural effusions. The right pleural effusion is small. The left
 pleural effusion is moderate. Increased opacity of the bilateral bases likely
 represents atelectasis. Increased interstitial markings coupled with
 indistinctness of the hila is consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions, within moderate
 size left and small right pleural effusions.
 
 2. Interval worsening of pulmonary edema, which is now mild-to-moderate.
