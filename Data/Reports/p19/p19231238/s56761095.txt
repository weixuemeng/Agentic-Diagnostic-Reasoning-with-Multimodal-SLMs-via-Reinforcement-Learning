                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF and hypertension and diabetes, worsening cough and
 dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are new diffuse opacities
 in both lungs, right greater than left likely due to slight leftward rotation.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There
 is mild cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New diffuse bilateral opacities likely represent moderate
 pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly and small bilateral effusions, most
 consistent with CHF exacerbation.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
