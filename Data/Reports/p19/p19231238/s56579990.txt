                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sputum  // Eval PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right appear infrahilar opacity and left mid to lower lung opacities could
 relate to pulmonary edema versus multifocal infection.  There is blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle which may be due to consolidation and atelectasis,
 but a small pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apparent infrahilar opacities as well as left base opacity may be due to
 multifocal pneumonia with possible superimposed pulmonary edema.
