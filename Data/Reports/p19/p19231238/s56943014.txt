                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain, distension, no BM few days
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Mediastinal contour
 appears similar.  Low lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in the
 lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is present.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.  Clips are
 noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
