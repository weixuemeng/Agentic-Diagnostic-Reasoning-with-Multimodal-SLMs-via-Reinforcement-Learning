 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The heart is mildly enlarged.

 edema or convincing signs of pneumonia. Flattened diaphragms with widened AP
 diameter of the chest may reflect underlying COPD. No pneumothorax.
 Mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact. No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm. DISH related changes of the T-spine noted.

 Mild cardiomegaly with tiny pleural effusions. No overt evidence for pneumonia
