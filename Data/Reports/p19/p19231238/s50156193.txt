                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly similar.  There
 is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases are similar compared to the prior study,
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  Hypertrophic changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis, not substantially
 changed from prior.
