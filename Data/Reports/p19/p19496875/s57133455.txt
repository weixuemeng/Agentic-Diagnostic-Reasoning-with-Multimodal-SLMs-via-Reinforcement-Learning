                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, cough for 2 days, syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is relatively unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear opacity within the
 anterior aspect of the upper lobe, possibly in the left upper lobe, is best
 seen on lateral view, and is compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  While
 there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are visualized.  Clips
 are seen within the upper abdomen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Subsegmental atelectasis within likely
 the left upper lobe.
