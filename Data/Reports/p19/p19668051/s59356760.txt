                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachycardia, leukocytosis  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  On the frontal projection,
 triangular opacity obscures the left CP angle, possibly representing pleural
 thickening, pneumonia, vs small effusion. Right lung is clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small triangular opacity in the left CP angle could represent pleural
 thickening, pneumonia less likely effusion. Followup to resolution.
