                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle peribronchical thickening at the right base is suggestive of
 continued resolution of the prior infection.  It has improved since the prior
 exam.  The lungs are otherwise clear without a new consolidation or edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The fine nodular pattern seen
 on the prior CT is not well evaluated on chest radiograph.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued improvement of right lower lobe infectious process.  No
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
