                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
 Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort for
 further assessment.
