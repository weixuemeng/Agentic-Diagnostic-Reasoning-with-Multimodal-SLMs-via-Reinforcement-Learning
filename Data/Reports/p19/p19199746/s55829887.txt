                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo s/p fall w/ SDH, SAH, sub-galeal hematoma, nasal   facial
 fx, C6 fx, lateral rib fx,  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube, PICC line and nasogastric tube are all unchanged in
 appearance when compared to the prior study.  Multiple right-sided rib
 fractures are noted.  These are unchanged in appearance compared to multiple
 prior studies.  Mild cardiomegaly with haziness of the pulmonary vasculature
 may in part be due to low lung volumes but may also reflect a degree of fluid
 overload.  Linear atelectasis at the left lung base. No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
