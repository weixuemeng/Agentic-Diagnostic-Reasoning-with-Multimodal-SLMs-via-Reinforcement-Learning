 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric
 tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not
 included in the image.  There are now signs of mild pulmonary edema.  In
 addition, a relatively large left lower lobe atelectasis is present.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic sinus suggests the presence of a small pleural
 effusion.  The known lateral rib fractures are not appreciated on the
 radiograph.
