                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by a low lung
 volumes. There are perihilar opacities raising concern for mild pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy left basilar opacities most likely relate to edema, however,
 infectious process not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Dedicated
 PA and lateral views or frontal view within improved inspiration would be
 helpful for further evaluation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
