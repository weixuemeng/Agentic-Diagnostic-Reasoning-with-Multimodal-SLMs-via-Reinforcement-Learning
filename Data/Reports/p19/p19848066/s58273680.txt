 HISTORY:  COPD and acute pancreatitis.  Suspect effusions and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumonia.  Increased vascular congestion in
 the lungs may indicate mild elevation of left atrial pressure, but there is no
 clear pulmonary edema or particular distention of mediastinal veins. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard
 placements, unchanged.  Pleural effusion is small, on the right, if any.
