                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with interior STEMI, 3 pressor requirement,
 tachycardia then decreasing O2 requirements  // evaluate for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT ___ MIN PAST MIDNIGHT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the tip of the aortic balloon pump appears to lie
 higher.  Though the aortic knob is not well delineated, it appears to lie at
 the top of the expected location of the aortic knob. ET tube tip approximately
 3.9 cm above the carina. NG tube, beneath the diaphragm, with tip overlying
 fundus. Catheter from an inferior approach, question Swan-Ganz catheter, with
 tip overlying the region of the main pulmonary artery.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there may have been slight leftward shift of the
 mediastinum. Again seen are diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs,
 most pronounced in the upper zones, with relative sparing of the lower zones.
 Density of the left upper zone is more confluent than on the prior study.
 There are not fully characterized, but could represent an atypical
 distribution of CHF with pulmonary edema or other alveolar infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Positioning of aortic balloon pump is thought to be high--___ see
 comments above. This has been subsequently repositioned, as seen on a
 radiograph from ___ at 08:15.
 2. Possible slight interval leftward shift of the mediastinum, suggesting the
 presence of some volume loss on the left.
 3. Dense, somewhat patchy, bilateral alveolar infiltrates, with upper zone
 predominance. This is not fully characterized. In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could represent atypical distribution of pulmonary edema, ARDS,
 or other causes of alveolar infiltrates. Possibility of a component pleural
 fluid or apical capping cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated, chest CT
 may help for more complete characterization.
