                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with STEMI now intubated with IABP in place  //
 assess placement of ET tube and other acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube
 an NG type tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus, beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 An IABP is present, extending from an inferior approach. The aortic knob
 itself is not well-defined, but the radiopaque tip probably lies at or
 immediately below the lower edge of the aortic knob.
 
 There are dense, confluent opacities in both upper zones, extending into the
 mid/ lower zones, but with sparing of both lung bases. The degree of
 confluence is greater on the left. No effusion is identified.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal, but not frankly
 enlarged.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET and NG tubes, as described.
 2. IABP radiopaque tip probably lies at or immediately below the inferior edge
 of the aortic knob.
 3. Dense left-greater-than-right opacities, with upper lobe predominance and
 sparing of the bases. While this could represent an atypical distribution of
 CHF, including changes associated with valve dysfunction, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, the upper lobe predominance would also raise the question of
 infectious or inflammatory etiologies.
