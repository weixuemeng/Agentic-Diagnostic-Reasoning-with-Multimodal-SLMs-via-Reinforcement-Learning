                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient , septic_.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is persistent consolidation and loss of volume in the left lower lobe
 and in the lingula.  These have worsened from the prior study.  These suggest
 progression of pneumonia and probably collapse in the left lower lobe. 
 Multifocal opacities in the right lung have increased, more so in the
 periphery of the right upper lobe.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as before.  ET
 tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view, but below the
 diaphragm, a loop is partially visualized.
 
 Right lower lobe medial opacity is unchanged.
 
 Left IJ catheter tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multifocal pneumonia.  Probably collapsed left lower
 lobe.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time of discovery of the findings
 on ___ at 9:40 a.m.
