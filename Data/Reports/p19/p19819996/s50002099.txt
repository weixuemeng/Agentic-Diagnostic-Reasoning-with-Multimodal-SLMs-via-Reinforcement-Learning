  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise unchanged support lines, with ETT no
  less than 1.2 cm above carina with the neck flexed, large LLL and inferior LUL
  atelectasis/consolidation.  Minimal increased opacity in RLL compared to CXR
  earlier same day may represent atelectasis but should be followed on
  subsequent studies for development of new focus of pneumonia. -___ ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Secondary peritonitis from PD catheter and hypotension.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed same day earlier in the morning.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as
 before.  New right lower lobe opacities are likely atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Widened mediastinum is unchanged.  Large left lower lobe
 retrocardiac opacity is unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard
 position.
