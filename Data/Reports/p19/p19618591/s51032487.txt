                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes and lordotic
 positioning.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged but this is likely
 accentuated due to low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam with low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process
 otherwise identified.
