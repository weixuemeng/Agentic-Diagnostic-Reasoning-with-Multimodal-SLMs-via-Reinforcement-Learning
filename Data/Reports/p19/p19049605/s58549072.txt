 INDICATION:  Lung cancer, cough and low-grade fever, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence

 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  In addition, the soft tissue density
 next to an osteolytic rib destruction on the left has increased in size. 
 Finally, today's radiograph shows minimal dorsal pleural effusion, better seen
 on the lateral radiograph.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged sternal wires and
 unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
