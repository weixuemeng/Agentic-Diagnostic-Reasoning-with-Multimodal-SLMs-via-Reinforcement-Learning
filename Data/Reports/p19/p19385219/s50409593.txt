                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, ___, pleural effusion, MRSA
 bacteremia now with downtrending Cr  // worsening pleural effusion s/p ___  
 worsening pleural effusion s/p ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged, with the nasogastric tube extending to the distal
 stomach.  .  Continued opacification at the right base is consistent with
 pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels in this patient with enlargement of
 cardiac silhouette raises possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
