                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with central line placement confirmation  //
 Subclavian central line placement confirmation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.9 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in left upper
 quadrant ; side port appears to be at the level of the gastroesophageal
 junction, consider advancement so that it is well within the stomach.  Right
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The lungs are hyperinflated appear blunting of the
 costophrenic angles may be due to small pleural effusions.  Possible pleural
 plaque is seen particularly over the right upper to mid hemi thorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.9 cm above the level of the
 carina.
 
 Enteric tube courses into the left upper quadrant, however, the distal side
 port appears to be at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, consider
 advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
 
 Right subclavian central venous line terminates in the low SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
