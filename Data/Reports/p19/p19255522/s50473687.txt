                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and CKD on HD presenting with resp
 failure  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The support and monitoring devices are unchanged.  The first side port of the
 nasogastric tube remains at the GE junction.  The overall appearance of the
 lung are unchanged with hyperinflation and linear calcific opacity in the
 periphery of the right lung.  No acute focal consolidation or interstitial
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Localized lucency in the right costophrenic angle likely represents localized
 bullous disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   No significant interval change.
 
 2. Hyperinflation suggestive of COPD and calcified pleural plaque in the right
 lung.
 
 3. Localized lucency in the right costophrenic angle likely represents
 localized bullous disease and less likely a loculated basilar pneumothorax
