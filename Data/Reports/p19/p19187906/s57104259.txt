                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, car into tree.  Evaluate for trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 AP CHEST, ONE VIEW:  A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of these
 radiographs.  The endotracheal tube extends into the proximal portion of the
 right mainstem bronchus.  Lung volumes are low.  The lungs are clear.  There
 are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  An NG tube passes below the level of the
 left hemidiaphragm, curling superiorly within the gastric cardia.  The bony
 thorax is intact.
 
 AP PELVIS, ONE VIEW:  No fracture or dislocation.  A left femoral catheter is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  ET tube ends within the proximal right main stem bronchus and should be
 withdrawn by 6 cm for appropriate positioning.
 
 3.  Bony pelvis is grossly intact.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 2:33 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
