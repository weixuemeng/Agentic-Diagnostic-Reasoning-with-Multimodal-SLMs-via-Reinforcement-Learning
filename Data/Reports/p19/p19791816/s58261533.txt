                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is mildly rotated. Port-A-Cath over the right mid chest terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely
 related to technique. Heterogeneous opacification over the right mid lung is
 most consistent with pleural plaques. Bibasilar opacities may represent
 atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Heterogeneous right lung opacifications predominantly relates to large
 pleural plaques.
 
 2. Bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis, and a small left pleural
 effusion.
