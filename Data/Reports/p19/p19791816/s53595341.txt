 Extensive pleural plaques on the right make it difficult to assess for
 underlying parenchymal abnormality.  There are moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions left greater than right. There is volume loss at both bases. While
 there some differences in the appearance of the lungs compared to prior
 studies these are felt to be predominantly positional with a pleural plaques
 projecting over different areas of the lungs on today's exam. There is no
 definite new infiltrate. if pneumonia is of concern this would need to be
 assessed for by CT
