 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with VAP  // ? acute change      ? acute change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 04:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked right pleural calcifications encasing most of the lung limiting
 evaluation. However, overall appearance has not changed.  The previously noted
 interstitial edema has improved.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle which may reflect a small effusion. Several calcified nodular opacities
 in the left lower lung and at both apices are suggestive of prior
 granulomatous infection.  No definite new airspace consolidation is
 appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given
 differences in patient rotation. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Endotracheal tube and right central
 line are unchanged in position.
