                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the mid SVC region unchanged.
 Extensive bilateral calcified pleural plaque is again noted right greater than
 left. A calcified granuloma projects over the left lower lung. No convincing
 evidence for pneumonia though evaluation of the right lung is limited. Heart
 remains mildly enlarged. The patient's kyphotic positioning somewhat limits
 assessment of the mediastinum. Bony structures appear intact though
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive calcified pleural plaque limits assessment. No definite sign of
 pneumonia.
