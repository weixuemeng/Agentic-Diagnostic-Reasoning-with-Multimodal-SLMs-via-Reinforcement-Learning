                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypotension  // eval pneumonia, volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited due to portable technique and patient body habitus. Increased
 interstitial markings are likely due to these factors.  There is no obvious
 edema.  Opacity at the left cardiophrenic angle is compatible with prominent
 fat pad seen on prior CT.  Retrocardiac region is poorly assessed.  Right
 chest wall dual lead pacing device is again noted as well as a left sided
 port.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
