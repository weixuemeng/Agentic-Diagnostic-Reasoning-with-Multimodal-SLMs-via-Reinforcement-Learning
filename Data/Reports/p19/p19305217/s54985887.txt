                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke-like symptoms.  Question infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is calcified and
 mildly tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Fissures are
 mildly thickening suggesting a slight state of fluid overload.  However there
 is no evidence for parenchymal edema.  Minimal opacification at the lung bases
 suggests minor atelectasis or perhaps chronic change.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing findings for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
