                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post ileostomy takedown, required increased oxygen.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 Comparison is made with the reference chest x-ray of ___.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is increased density in the right lower
 zone, which appears to border on the minor fissure on the PA film and the
 major fissure on the lateral film.  Appearances are most suggestive of volume
 loss and possibly big, expanding right lower lobe and middle lobe.
 
 Left pleural effusion is present, cause of which is not determined. 
 Elsewhere, the lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Volume loss in right lower lobe and probably right middle lobe.
