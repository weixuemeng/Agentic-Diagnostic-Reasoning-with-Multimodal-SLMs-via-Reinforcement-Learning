 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is no substantial change. 
 Slightly reduced lung volumes with retrocardiac atelectasis but without
 evidence of pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  A soft tissue density contour in
 right paramediastinal location, not visible on the previous image, is likely
 vascular in origin.  This could be clarified by a CT examination of the
 mediastinum.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.
