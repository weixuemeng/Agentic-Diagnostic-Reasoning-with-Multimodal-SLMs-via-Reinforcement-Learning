                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of left IJ central venous catheter
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ hours.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated, with the tip of the endotracheal
 tube positioned 3.5 cm from the level of the carina.  An NG tube is in place,
 though the tip and side hole are not seen.  
 
 There is interval improvement from 8AM in severe bilateral alveolar opacity,
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 markedly enlarged reflecting known moderate pericardial effusion.
 
 A left internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed in the
 interim, the tip projects over the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax on this
 limited supine film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval left IJ catheter placement; the tip is positioned in the mid SVC.
 
 2.  Slight improvement from 8AM of severe alveolar opacities which likely
 reflect edema superimposed upon disseminated infection.
