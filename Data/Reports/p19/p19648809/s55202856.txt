                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly cannot be totally assessed.  Widened mediastinum is grossly
 unchanged from prior.  Diffuse lung opacities have minimally improved in the
 apices, but worsened in the right middle lobe.  ET tube is in standard
 position.  The tip is 4.9 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is out of view
 below the diaphragm.  Right IJ and left IJ catheter tips are in the mid SVC. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.
