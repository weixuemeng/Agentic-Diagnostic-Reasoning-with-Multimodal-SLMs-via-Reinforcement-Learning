                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with ARDS and respiratory failure, assess ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  From ___, there is increase in confluent bilateral airspace
 consolidation with air bronchograms.  This precludes evaluation of the cardiac
 silhouette and of the mediastinal contours. There is no pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 A left IJ catheter tip both projects in the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is
 unchanged in position.  An NG tube passes below the level of the diaphragm,
 though the tip is not seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing confluent bilateral diffuse airspace disease, consistent with
 given clinical history of ARDS.
 2.  Stable and appropriate positioning of support lines and tubes.
