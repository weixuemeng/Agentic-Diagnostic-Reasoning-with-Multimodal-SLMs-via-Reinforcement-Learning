                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of endotracheal tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___ at 4:16
 am, taken 4.5 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest shows a new endotracheal tube
 terminating no less than 4 cm above the carina.  Compared to 4.5 hours
 earlier, there has been marked worsening of alveolar pulmonary edema, now
 largely masking the peripheral nodular opacities likely representing
 disseminated infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There is
 no pnuemothorax.  Marked widening of the cardiac silhouette is stable since
 admission and reflects the presence of pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on what is likely a disseminated
 infectious process.
 2. Stable pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly.
 3. The endotracheal tube is properly positioned.
 
 NOTE:  The results, in conjuction with the prior radiograph taken at 4:16 am,
 were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on ___
 at 9:35 am.
