                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 05:24 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube, NG tube and right IJ central venous catheter are
 unchanged in position.  There is interval improved aeration of the right upper
 lobe with persistent rounded opacity in the right suprahilar region and
 ill-defined opacity of the left lung base concerning for multifocal infectious
 process.  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly improved from the prior
 study.  There is no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 plate-like atelectasis is new from the prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the right upper lobe and left lung base with
 persistent multifocal opacities consistent with infection.
