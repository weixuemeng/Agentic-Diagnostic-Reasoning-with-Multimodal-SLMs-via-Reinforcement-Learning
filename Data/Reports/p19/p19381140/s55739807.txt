                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic valve replacement and CABG.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax after the chest tubes have been removed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube,
 Swan-Ganz catheter, and left chest tube have been removed.  A right subclavian
 central venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip in the right
 atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac volume loss has increased. 
 Linear opacities at the bilateral bases are likely atelectasis.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or definite pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, with a postoperative appearance of the mediastinal
 and mild enlargement of the heart.  Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Removal of the left chest tube.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Right subclavian central venous catheter with tip in the right atrium.
 3.  Increased retrocardiac and bibasilar atelectasis.
