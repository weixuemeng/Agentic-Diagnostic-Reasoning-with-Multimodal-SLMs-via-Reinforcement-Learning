                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for evidence of tooth fragments.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are fully expanded and clear.  No pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart, mediastinal and pleural
 surface contours are normal.  A density seen projecting over the region of the
 bifurcation of the left main stem bronchus could represent a vessel or a
 possible foreign body, not clearly visualized on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Question of possible radiodense foreign body projecting over the
 region of the bifurcation of the left main stem bronchus could represent a
 vessel or a possible foreign body.  This may be further evaluated with shallow
 oblique radiographs.
