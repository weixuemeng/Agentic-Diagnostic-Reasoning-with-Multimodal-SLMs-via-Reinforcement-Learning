                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position allowing for patient position. The diameter of the cuff exceeds the
 diameter of the native trachea. Nasogastric tube follows the expected course
 with the side port below the diaphragm, but the tip is out of view.  
 
 Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity
 with air bronchograms is likely atelectasis. Left pleural effusion is small,
 if any.  Linear atelectasis in the right midlung is new. Large vascular hila
 are exaggerated by patient position. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ETT cuff exceeds tracheal diameter. Correlate clinically to avoid tracheal
 damage.
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis, but underlying pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
