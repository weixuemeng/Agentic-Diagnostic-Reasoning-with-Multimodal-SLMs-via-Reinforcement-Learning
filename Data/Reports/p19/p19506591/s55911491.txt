                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  An area of pleural thickening at the lateral bases of the right
 hemithorax is constant in appearance.  Also constant is a zone of nodular
 thickening embedded in this area.  The nodule has not increased in size, but
 CT would be more sensitive to confirm stability of the lesion.
 
 No other relevant changes.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No new
 pulmonary nodule.  The lymph node calcifications at the lower aspect of the
 left hilus are constant in appearance.
