                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural
 thickening/scarring versus a trace pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no definite
 effusion is seen on the lateral view.  There is no focal consolidation.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Bilateral nipple shadows are
 incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, of uncertain acuity,
 could be due to pleural thickening/scarring versus a trace pleural effusion.
