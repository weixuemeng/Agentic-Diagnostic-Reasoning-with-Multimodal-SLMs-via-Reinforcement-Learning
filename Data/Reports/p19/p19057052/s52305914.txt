 INDICATION:  Desaturation, evaluation of endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:27 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is in
 unchanged position.  However, there is increased fluid marking of the minor

 lobe.  The areas of atelectasis at the left lung base are constant.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  No larger pleural effusions.
