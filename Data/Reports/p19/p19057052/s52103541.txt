                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  Portable chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lower lung zone atelectasis and pleural effusion are
 improved today; however, the right lower lobe is still not fully re-expanded. 
 In addition, the appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation and pleural
 effusion is also improved.  There is a new focal bulge below the level of the
 aortic knob, which may represent atelectatic lung compressed against the
 hilum.  There is no pneumothorax.  Support devices remain in good position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved appearance of right and left lower lobe consolidation and pleural
 effusions.
 2.  Slight change in mediastinal contour of unclear significance. 
 Conventional PA and lateral chest radiograph to be obtained when the patient
 is stable to better evaluate this finding.
