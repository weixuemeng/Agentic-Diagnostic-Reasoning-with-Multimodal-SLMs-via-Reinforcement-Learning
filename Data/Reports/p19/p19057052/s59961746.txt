 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  There is a newly developed atelectasis in both the middle lobe and
 at the bases of the right upper lobe.  An atelectatic change is also seen in
 the retrocardiac lung areas.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
 upper range of normal, but no evidence of pulmonary edema is present.  The
 vertebral fixation devices are in constant position.
