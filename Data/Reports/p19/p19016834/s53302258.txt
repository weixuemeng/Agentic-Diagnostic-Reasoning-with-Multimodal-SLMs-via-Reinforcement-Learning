 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Esophageal stent placement, oxygen-dependent, cough.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The esophageal stent is again visualized and is more superiorly
 located than on the exam from five days prior.  There is new increased opacity
 at both bases, right greater than left, with the right side being most
 suggestive of an infiltrate.  The left could be due to volume loss. There is
 small right-sided effusion as well.
