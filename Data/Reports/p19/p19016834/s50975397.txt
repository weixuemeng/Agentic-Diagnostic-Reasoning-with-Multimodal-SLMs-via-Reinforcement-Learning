                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent esophageal stricture, status post
 dilatation.  History of esophageal cancer, status post esophagectomy and
 gastric pull-through.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new dense right central opacity approximately 7 cm x 3
 cm on frontal view.  Given the rapid onset of this finding, the differential
 is limited to airspace consolidation ___ atelectasis.  Given previous
 radiographic evidence of slow neo-esophageal/gastric emptying, it is possible
 that patient had aspirated contrast material.  This would also explain the
 dense opacity seen on lateral projection.  However, other radiopaque fluid,
 such as fluid, pus, ___ ___, ___ be filling the airspace in this region. 
 Adjacent to this dense opacity are ill-defined peripheral opacities which is
 not matched on the contralateral side.  The left lung is unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion ___ pneumothorax.  There is pronounced flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and within
 normal limits.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large dense right central opacity which ___ represent collapse ___
 airspace consolidation with adjacent area of asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Given history of lymphadenopathy, collapse could be secondary to nodal
 compression of an airway.  
 
 Alternatively, given recent history of oral contrast and poor gastric
 emptying, opacity ___ represent aspirated contrast material.  Consolidation
 also ___ be secondary to a fistula between the neo-esophagus and the right
 lung.
 
 If this finding represent consolidation, the radiopaque material cannot be
 identified definitely and ___ represent ___, fluid ___ pus.
 
 CT imaging is highly recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:45 p.m. via phone by
 ___.
