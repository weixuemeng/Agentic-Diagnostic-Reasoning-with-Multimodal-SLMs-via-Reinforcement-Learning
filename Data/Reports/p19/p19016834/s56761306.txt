                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post dilation of esophageal stricture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Since the prior radiograph, there has been increased nodular
 peribronchial opacification, most readily explained by chronic aspiration. 
 Mild hazy opacification at the left base is unchanged and likely represents
 chronic atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 2.  Increasing peribronchial opacification at the right base likely represents
 aspiration, possibly pneumonia.
