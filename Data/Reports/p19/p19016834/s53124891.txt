                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post esophagectomy, esophageal
 stent, check for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP chest examination of
 ___.  Heart size remains normal.  Unremarkable appearance of aortic
 contours.  Similar as identified on the previous examination, there is a wide
 caliber (___-mm diameter) stent occupying the esophagus and reaching from the
 upper thorax clavicular level down into the hiatus (see also report on barium
 examination of neoesophagus of same day).  There is a right-sided pleural
 effusion that blunts the right-sided lateral pleural sinus but extends into
 the posterior pleural spaces, occupying the area posterior to the stent
 prosthesis along the right posterior chest wall.  The amount of pleural
 effusion has increased in comparison with the preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  The left-sided hemithorax demonstrates
 unchanged findings with regard to pulmonary vasculature and absence of any new
 acute infiltrates.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.
