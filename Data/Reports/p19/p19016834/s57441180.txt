                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of new right IJ
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of a right transjugular central venous catheter, distal tip
 not well evaluated, appears to extend to the expected location of the mid SVC,
 although exact location is not well evaluated on this study.  There is diffuse
 opacification of the right hemithorax which maybe due to underlying fluid and
 consolidation.  The esophageal stent has migrated projecting over the right
 apex as compared to the prior study of ___.  The left lung is grossly
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right IJ extending to the expected location of the mid SVC,
 although not well evaluated due to overlying opacity.  No definite
 pneumothorax.  Right hemithorax nearly completely opacified which appears
 slightly increased as compared to the prior study, although in the prior study
 the patient was upright so there may be shift in fluid.  The esophageal stent
 projects superiorly into the right apex, stable since the prior study but
 migrated in position as compared to ___.
