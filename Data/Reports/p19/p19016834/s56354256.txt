                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with esophageal cancer,
 after esophagectomy with new right middle lobe opacity, interval followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 The large right perihilar consolidation with surrounding ground glass has
 substantially improved in the interim.  Giving the absence of this abnormality
 on prior CT from ___, it most likely reflects substantial
 infectious process and should be closely followed for documentation of
 complete resolution.  Malignant involvement is substantially less likely.
 
 Lateral view demonstrates air-fluid level in the neoesophagus, expected in
 appearance.  Small amount of right pleural effusion cannot be excluded, might
 be secondary to the infection.
