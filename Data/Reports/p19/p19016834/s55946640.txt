                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Word finding difficulty, right lower lobe crackles, assess
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with markedly widened AP diameter of the chest which is
 compatible with emphysema.  An area of presumed scarring at the right lung
 base appears stable from most recent prior exam.  There is no new
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable.  Bony structures intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD, scarring at the right lung base.  No definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.
