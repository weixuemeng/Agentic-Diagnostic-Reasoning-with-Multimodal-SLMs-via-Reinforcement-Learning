                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough in a patient with recent pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates persistent right lower lobe consolidation with
 right infrahilar opacity and small amount of pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 cavitation is demonstrated.  Left lung is clear.
 
 Given the persistence of the abnormality, chest CT might be considered to
 exclude the possibility of post-obstructive infectious process.
