                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old male patient status post esophagectomy, history of
 pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, also has bilateral pleural effusions,
 on tube-feed.  Evaluate interval changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  Previously described right subclavian
 approach Port-A-Cath system remains in unchanged position.  The heart size and
 mediastinal structures are also unaltered and grossly within normal limits. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The previously described local
 pleural densities have further regressed, in particular a rather bulging
 prominence and thickening of the pleural space in the mid portion of the right
 lateral chest wall has regressed.  Basal right-sided pleural effusion blunting
 the lateral pleural sinus and extending into the posterior pleural sinus and
 corresponding posterior pleural space remain unchanged.  No new abnormalities
 are identified.  As before, general impression of COPD persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild regression of previously identified mostly loculated pleural
 effusions.  No new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities.
