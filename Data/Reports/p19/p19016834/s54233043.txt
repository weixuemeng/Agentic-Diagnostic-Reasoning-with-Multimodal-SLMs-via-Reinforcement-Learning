                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is continued opacification of the right base.  It is not
 significantly worsened since the prior exam.  This may be due to a combination
 of pleural effusion, atelectasis, and aspiration.  In the proper clinical
 setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is a stable moderate right
 pleural effusion.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No new
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  An esophageal stent is unchanged
 in position.  A drain is present overlying the mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Unchanged opacification at the right base.  This may be due to atelectasis
 or aspiration.  In the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Stable moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
