                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cancer with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post esophagectomy
 and gastric pull-through procedure with a stent redemonstrated within the
 neoesophagus.  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is
 similar.  There is persistent opacification of the right lung base with a
 small right pleural effusion, not significantly changed in size.  Left lung is
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is continued opacification of the right lung base, possibly
 reflecting a combination of pleural effusion with atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
