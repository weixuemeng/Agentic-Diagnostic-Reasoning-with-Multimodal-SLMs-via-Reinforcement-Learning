 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with severe asthma and COPD.  Intubated. 
 Evaluate possible pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Interstitial edema improved between ___ and ___, and pulmonary
 vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly have remained relatively stable
 ever since.  There is greater peribronchial opacification in the right lower
 lobe as before, since at least ___, so I do not think this is pneumonia.

 an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Small
 left pleural effusion has been present since ___ as well.  No
 pneumothorax.
