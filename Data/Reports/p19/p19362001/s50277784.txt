                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute mental status change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no
 large right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Again seen are
 bilateral lower lung opacities, left greater than right, not significantly
 changed compared to prior.  Left chest port is in unchanged position with tip
 in the low SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar appearance compared to most recent prior radiograph with bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right. This may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia. Clinical correlation to left lower lobe signs and
 symptoms is recommended. Lateral view would also be helpful for further
 characterization.
