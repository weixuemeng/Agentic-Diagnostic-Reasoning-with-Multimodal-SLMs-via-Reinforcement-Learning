                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Somnolent patient with COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.  CTA Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  The patient has been extubated in
 the interim and the NGT removed.  Left-sided subclavian catheter tip is in
 stable position.  The left lower lobe is chronically consolidated, presumably
 atelectatic  (the mediastinum is anatomically located to the left).  Right
 lower lung atelectasis is slightly improved.  Mild interstitial edema and
 moderate cardiomegaly are also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic left lower lobe atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema.
