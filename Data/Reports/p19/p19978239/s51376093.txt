                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall stable radiographic appearance of the chest except for
 development of a subtle area of opacity at the left lung base adjacent to a
 large hiatal hernia.  This may be due to focal atelectasis, aspiration, or an
 early focus of pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiograph may be helpful in
 this regard.
