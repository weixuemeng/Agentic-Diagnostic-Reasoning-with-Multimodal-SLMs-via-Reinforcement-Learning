                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever neutropenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  On the frontal view only there
 is patchy opacity at the medial left lung base suggesting atelectasis;
 developing pneumonia is possible, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity at the left base, atelectasis versus pneumonia; correlation with
 pulmonary symptoms is recommended, if any.  Short-term follow-up radiographs
 may be helpful if there is clinical concern for developing infectious process.
