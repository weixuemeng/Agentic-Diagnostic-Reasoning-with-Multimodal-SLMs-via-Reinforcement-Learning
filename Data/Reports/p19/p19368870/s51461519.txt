                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea/ cough  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Subtle linear density in the
 right lower lung is likely indicative of scarring.  A retrocardiac bulbous
 opacity is most compatible with a small hiatal hernia.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small retrocardiac density is compatible with hiatal hernia.  No signs of
 pneumonia or edema.
