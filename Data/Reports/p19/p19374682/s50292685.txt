                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are trace bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  No pulmonary edema is
 evident.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  An approximately 2 cm
 spiculated masslike density projects over the left mid lung.  Just superior to
 this is a well-circumscribed 2.5 cm mass like density projecting over the left
 mid lung at the level of the left main pulmonary artery.  There is mild focal
 leftward tracheal deviation. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Mass-like
 densities projecting in the left mid lung, 1 of which demonstrates spiculated
 margins; although these could represent overlapping shadows or scarring,
 malignancy cannot be excluded. Non-urgent chest CT is recommended.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by
 ___ by telephone at 15:32 on ___ after attending
 radiologist review.
