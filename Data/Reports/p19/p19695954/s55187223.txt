 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:45 PM
  Moderate left pleural effusion, increased compared to the most recent
  radiograph from ___.  Consolidative left retrocardiac
  opacification is likely compressive atelectasis.  Heterogeneous right lower
  lung opacities continue to increase, possibly atelectasis or a developing
  infectious process.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is not significantly
  changed.  Moderate cardiomegaly is redemonstrated.  No pneumothorax.  No
  pneumomediastinum.  Marked deformity of the left humeral head, as before. 
  Interval removal of a large bore right internal jugular central venous
  catheter.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 7:44 p.m.
  via telephone on the day of the study, immediately after discovery of the
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss and pleural
 effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 The large-bore central catheter from the right IJ has been removed.
