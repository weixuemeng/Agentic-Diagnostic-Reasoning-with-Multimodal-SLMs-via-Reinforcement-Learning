                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with systolic and diastolic
 congestive heart failure as well as gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The patient is after median sternotomy and replacement of the mitral valve
 with stable appearance of both.  As compared to the prior study, there is
 interval slight improvement in pulmonary edema which is still present,
 substantial.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, left more than right.  No
 change in the fractured left humeral head demonstrated.
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest infectious process demonstrated.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity appears to be more pronounced than the rest of the
 findings and thus concerning for coexisting left lower lobe consolidation.
