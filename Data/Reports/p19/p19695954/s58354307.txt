 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___; ___;
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right supraclavicular central venous catheter which ends
 in the mid SVC.  There appears to be mild interval improvement of the
 bilateral pulmonary edema with evidence of continued, yet improved vascular
 engorgement.  There appears to be a worsening in opacity in the left
 retrocardiac region which could be secondary to atelectasis and or worsening
 pleural effusion, compared to the previous study.  The mediastinal contours
 are stable. There is moderate cardiomegaly, stable at least since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to increasing
 atelectasis and/or effusion.
 
 2. Slight improvement of pulmonary edema.
