                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation for respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph.  ET tube terminates 2.2 cm above the
 diaphragm.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Mediastinal clips and mitral
 valve replacement are again noted.  A transvenous pacer lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.  There is probably a small left pleural effusion with
 retrocardiac atelectasis, though left lower lobe collapse cannot be excluded. 
 Large right hilum is chronic, but there are subtle opacities at the right base
 not present on ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip terminates 2.2 cm above the carina.
 2.  New left lower lung opacification may represent left lower lobe collapse
 or retrocardiac atelectasis with a component of pleural effusion.  If
 obtainable, PA and lateral views would be helpful.
