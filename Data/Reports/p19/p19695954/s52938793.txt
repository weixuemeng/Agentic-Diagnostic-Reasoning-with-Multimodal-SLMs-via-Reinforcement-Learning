                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset right tender lymphadenopathy.  Bilateral crackles.  Rule
 out intrathoracic abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There has been interval improvement in bilateral lower lung opacifications. 
 However, a persistent retrocardiac opacity remains in the lower lobes.  There
 is left lower lobe atelectasis and layering pleural effusion.  There is also
 an increase in the size of the right pleural effusion.  There is moderate,
 stable cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours are widened, likely reflective
 of central lymphadenopathy.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Focal opacity in lower lobes could reflect an infectious process in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Mediastinal widening, likely related to central lymphadenopathy. 
 Recommend followup with CT scan.
 
 Findings were communicated with ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at the time of
