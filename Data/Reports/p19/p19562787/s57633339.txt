                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchial biopsy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following the procedure, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 There is some hazy opacification in the region of the biopsy site, some of
 which could reflect some post-procedure bleeding.
