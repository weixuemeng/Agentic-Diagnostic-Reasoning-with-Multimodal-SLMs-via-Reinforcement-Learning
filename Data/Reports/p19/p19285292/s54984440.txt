                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple CVAs, now with large L3-L4 disc herniation.  Preoperative
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased opacities in the perihilar distribution
 bilaterally but particularly on the right side.  In this area, there is also
 evidence of peribronchial cuffing, but whether this is within the bronchus or
 around the bronchus is uncertain.  This constellation of findings could be
 seen in cardiac failure and pulmonary edema process leading towards infection
 such as viral pneumonia is not ruled out.  There is minimal left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions.  The cardiac size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perihilar opacities, right greater than left, along with
 peribronchial cuffing.  Pulmonary edema versus an infectious process such as
 viral pneumonia are considerations.
