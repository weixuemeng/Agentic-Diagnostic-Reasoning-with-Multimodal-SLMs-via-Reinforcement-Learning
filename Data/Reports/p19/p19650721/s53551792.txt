                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and hypotension, here to evaluate for widening of the
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is complete opacification at the left lung base obscuring the
 left costophrenic angle, which is new from the prior study.  A small left
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on this single AP view.  The right
 lung is relatively clear.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated
 due to opacification of the left lung base.  The mediastinum appears prominent
 compared to the most recent prior study, which is in part related to
 technique; however, there is indistinctness at the aortic knob for which
 further evaluation with chest CTA is warranted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Prominent mediastinum in part related to technique with indistinct aortic
 knob. Further evaluation with chest CTA is pending.
 2.  Left basilar opacification may represent pneumonia or lung collapse.
