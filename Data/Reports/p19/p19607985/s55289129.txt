                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation. Assess endotracheal
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube
 coursing midline with tip out of field of view. Portion of enteric feeding
 tube is coiled within the stomach.  An endotracheal tube is seen at the level
 of the mid clavicles, 5 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate
 position.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis. Small right pleural
 effusion is noted. Heterogeneous opacity is seen within the right lower lobe.
 No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour,
 and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Minimally
 displaced fracture of the right posterior third rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position. Additional support tube as
 described above.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in right lower lobe  is worrisome for pneumonia with
 small pleural effusion.
 3.  Hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis.
 4. Minimally displaced right posterior third rib fracture.
