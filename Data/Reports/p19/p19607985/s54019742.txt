                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with new left subclavian central venous catheter.  Assess
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 14:34.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric feeding tube is seen coursing mid line with tip out of field of view.
 Portion of enteric feeding tube is coiled within the stomach. An endotracheal
 tube is seen above the level of the mid clavicles, 5.5 cm above the level of
 the carina in appropriate position. Interval placement of a left subclavian
 central venous catheter with tip at the left brachiocephalic/ SVC junction.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis. Small right pleural
 effusion is again noted. Heterogeneous opacity is again seen within the right
 lower lobe. No left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.  A minimally
 displaced rib fracture is seen along the posterior aspect of the right third
 rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left subclavian CVL tip at left brachiocephalic/SVC junction. Additional
 support lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in right lower lobe is worrisome for pneumonia with
 small pleural effusion.
 3.  Hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis.
 4.  Minimally displaced rib fracture of posterior aspect of right third rib.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 4:40 PM.
