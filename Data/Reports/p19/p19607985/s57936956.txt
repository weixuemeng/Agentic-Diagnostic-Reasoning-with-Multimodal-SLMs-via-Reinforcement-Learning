 There has been placement of a nasogastric tube. The tip and side port are in
 the right mainstem bronchus. This was subsequently readjusted. Heart size is
 upper limits of normal. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There are
 bilateral pleural effusions. There are airspace opacities bilaterally more
 confluent at the right base. This appears stable.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
 Tracheostomy is again seen and unchanged in position. There is a left-sided
 PICC line with tip in the distal SVC.
