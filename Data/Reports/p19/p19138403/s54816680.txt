                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia  // ? infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low.  The heart is top-normal in size with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with top-normal heart size.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Consider repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level and standard
 PA and lateral technique to allow more optimal assessment of the
 cardiovascular structures.  If findings persist, consider echocardiogram for
 further evaluation.
