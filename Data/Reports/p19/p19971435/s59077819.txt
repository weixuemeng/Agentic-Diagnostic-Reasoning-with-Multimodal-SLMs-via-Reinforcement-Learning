 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  A linear left upper lobe opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  There is
 mild rightward convex curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
