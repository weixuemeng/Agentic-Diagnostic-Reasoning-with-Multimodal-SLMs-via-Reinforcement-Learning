                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ILD. Now with L upper chest pleuritic chest
 pain, evaluate for interval change in lung disease. Assess for L rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely increased interstitial markings are slightly decreased in
 conspicuity compared with the prior study.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There
 is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  There is no
 displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slightly decreased conspicuity of the diffusely increased interstitial
 markings, potentially attributable to interval resolution of mild pulmonary
 edema superimposed on the unchanged chronic interstitial lung disease.
 2. No displaced rib fracture.
