                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sarcoid, enlarging nodules on CT  // Eval
 sarcoid nodules so can be followed serially      Eval sarcoid nodules so can
 be followed serially
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___,
 read in conjunction with chest CT ___.
 
 Several masslike regions of consolidation were seen in both lungs on
 conventional chest radiographs in ___ and the chest CT in ___. 
 All these are smaller today than they were on the chest radiographs ___ years
 ago and had probably decreased in size by the chest CT in ___.  It is
 difficult to say whether they have continued to involute since ___, but,
 for example the right middle lobe component is both smaller and has features
 of scarring, best appreciated by the retraction of the major fissure seen on
 the lateral view.  There are no new abnormalities in the lungs.
 
 The extent of central adenopathy has been underestimated by the conventional
 chest radiographs.  There is no change to suggest that the adenopathy is
 increasing.
 
 Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion.
 
 It is reasonable to continue to follow the progress of presumed pulmonary
 sarcoid, alternatively cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with conventional
 chest radiographs provided the patient remains asymptomatic.  If there is
 reason to repeat a chest CT, then a chest radiograph should be obtained
 concurrently to provide a better baseline for subsequent follow-up.
 
 
 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Discussed above.
