                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with suspected sarcoid s/p bronch with
 transbronchial biopsy.  // pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the right mid and lower lung has developed since the prior
 radiograph, and may reflect post procedural hemorrhage in the setting of
 recent biopsy in this region. These findings obscure the patient's known
 underlying lung abnormality in this region. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.
