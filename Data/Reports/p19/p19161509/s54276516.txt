                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, diabetes, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is mild
 linear density at the right lung base which is most compatible with
 atelectasis.  No definite consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 The imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable linear atelectasis at the right lung base.  No
 convincing signs of pneumonia.
