                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intracranial hemorrhage
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is exaggerated due to low lung volumes but is
 appears moderately enlarged. Widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low
 lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without
 overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
