 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 04:34.
 
 Lung volumes have improved.  Asymmetric opacification of the hemi thoraces
 continues.  Some of the abnormality on the right is due to persistent pleural
 effusion, but I suspect most of it is due to pneumonia, perhaps aspiration. 
 There is also a moderate left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size
 normal.
 
 Severe upper lobe scarring is long-standing.
