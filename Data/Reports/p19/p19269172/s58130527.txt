 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ gastric outlet obstruction ___ PUD s/p lap/robotic
 subtotal gastrectomy, J-tube  // eval for interval change     eval for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications, worse on the left, have substantially cleared.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is sharply seen, though there is still silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm with hazy opacification at the base, consistent with layering
 pleural he fusion.  Substantial opacification symmetrically involve the apical
 region, but there is no evidence of acute pneumothorax.
