                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with post-cholecys, sob. Pls eval for pna.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated back to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, with enlargement of the left atrium, has been stable
 compared to exams dating back to ___.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  A
 confluent opacity in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view it is
 difficult to assess in the setting of low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity on lateral view is potentially due to crowding of
 structures in the setting of low lung volumes, but repeat lateral radiograph
 with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to exclude a an early focus of
 pneumonia.
