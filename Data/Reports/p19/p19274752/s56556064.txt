                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  The patient with cirrhosis before transplantation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear, except for
 a cluster of dense nodules in the right mid lung, most likely consistent with
 calcified granulomas.  There is also a calcified right hilar lymph node, old
 findings consistent with prior  granulomatous exposure.  Atelectasis in the
 lingula is noted, better on the lateral view.  A small amount of pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Overall, there is no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process within limitations of this study
 technique.
