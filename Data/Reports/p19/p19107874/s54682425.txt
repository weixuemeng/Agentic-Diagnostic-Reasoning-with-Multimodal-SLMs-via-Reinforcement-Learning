                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, head strike
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged. Streaky opacity is seen in the retrocardiac region, possibly
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated. Scarring within the lung apices is again noted
 with curvilinear calcification in the region of the subclavian arteries again
 visualized bilaterally. Assessment of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by
 the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area. Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine which demonstrates a leftward
 curvature. Remote left-sided rib fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly limited assessment due to patient rotation. Streaky retrocardiac
 opacity, possibly atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
