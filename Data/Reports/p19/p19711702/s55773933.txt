                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration event.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day outside chest radiograph ___ 8:09.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is a right-sided internal jugular access Port-A-Cath in
 place with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Again appreciated
 are heterogeneous opacities through much of the right lung field predominantly
 in the right middle lobe as well as probable right lower lobe.  The left lung
 is essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Heterogeneous opacities through much of the right lung slightly improved from
 earlier same day examination compatible with aspiration.
