                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky posterior left basilar opacities
 suggest minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Although not optimally assessed, the
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are probably within normal limits for
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
