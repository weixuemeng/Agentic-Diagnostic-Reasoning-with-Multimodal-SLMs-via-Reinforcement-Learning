                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Preoperative evaluation.  Patient with right femoral neck fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  A rounded contour projecting along the lower central
 mediastinum suggests a substantial hiatal hernia, although not fully
 characterized.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Moderate-to-severe rightward
 convex curvature is centered along the upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Rounded contour in
 the lower mediastinum, probably a substantial hiatal hernia.
