  Hyperexpanded lungs suggest COPD. Tortuous aorta obscures evaluation of right
  hilum without clear evidence of adenopathy. Cardiomegaly.  ___ x 15 mm nodule
  in the right lung- given chart description of a chest CT from a nearby
  hospital- acquisition of this would be helpful in determining timing of
  appropriate follow up or role of further workup.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  history of hilar lymphadenopathy and lung nodule.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild overexpansion of the lungs, potentially consistent with a
 clinical picture of COPD.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  At the bases of the right
 lung, a well defined ___ x 23 mm dense lung nodule is seen.  The nodule could
 partly be calcified.  CT would be the next imaging choice in determining the
 nature of this nodule.  Other lung nodules are not visualized.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No atelectasis or pneumonia.
