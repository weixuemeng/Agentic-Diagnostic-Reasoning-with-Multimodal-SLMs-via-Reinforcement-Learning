                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male patient with history of right lower lobectomy now
 dizzy and hypoxemic.  Study requested to rule out recurrent cancer,
 infiltrate, and/or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is top normal in size.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Patient is status post right lower lobectomy with postsurgical
 changes. An area of increased opacification in the right lung base likely
 represents scar formation and appears unchanged from prior examination. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There are no pleural effusions, pneumothorax,
 focal consolidations or pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes are noted along
 the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Postsurgical changes at the right lung compatible with prior right
 lower lobectomy and scar formation.  No signs of superimposed pneumonia.
