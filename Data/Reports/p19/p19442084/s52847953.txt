 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right apical pneumothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apical
 pneumothorax has minimally decreased in extent but is still clearly visible. 
 Minimal air-fluid levels are seen at the right lung base, indicative of fluid
 or pneumothorax.
 
 The parenchymal opacities at the right lung base are constant.  Constant
 moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Unchanged
 moderate air collection in the right soft tissues.
