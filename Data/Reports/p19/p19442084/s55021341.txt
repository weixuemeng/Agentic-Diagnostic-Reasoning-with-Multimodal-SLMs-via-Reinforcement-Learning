                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with febrile neutropenia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains stable.  Opacification at the bases has increased.  It is
 unclear whether this represents merely overlying soft tissues in the portable
 projection, when compared to the previous upright PA view, or possible small
 pleural effusions.  The known right lower lobe nodule is not clearly seen on
 this study.  Otherwise, little change.
