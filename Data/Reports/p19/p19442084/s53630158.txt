                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, neutropenia, and right lower lobe
 crackles.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of top normal size with stable cardiomediastinal contours.  The right lung
 base linear opacity is similar to multiple prior examinations, compatible with
 chronic mucoid impaction.  Known right lower lobe nodule is not clearly
 visualized on this exam.  Small right pleural effusion is present, similar to
 prior.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Multilevel thoracic spine degenerative
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung linear opacity, similar to prior and likely
 reflects chronic mucoid impaction.  Small right pleural effusion is also
 similar to prior.
