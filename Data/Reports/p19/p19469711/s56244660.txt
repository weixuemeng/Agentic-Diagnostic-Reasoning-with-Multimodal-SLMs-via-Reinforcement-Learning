                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:24 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Supine positioning may be largely responsible for marked increase in upper
 mediastinal caliber and lesser increase in cardiac diameter.  This would
 require additional investigation if there is any reason to suspect mediastinal
 bleeding or an acute aortic syndrome.  First I recommend an upright view to
 see if it is a real development.  Lungs are grossly clear aside from mild left
 basilar atelectasis, and there is no pleural effusion.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with house officer.
