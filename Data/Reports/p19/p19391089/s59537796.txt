                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with history of fall,
 prior portable chest not fully diagnostic.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 exams, there is significant interval increase in the ill-defined opacity
 involving the majority of right hemithorax which is concerning for disease
 progression.  The possibility of a superimposed contusion given the history of
 trauma is impossible to exclude.  There may be a trace right pleural effusion.
 There is subtle opacity at the left lung base which is new though most likely
 represents metastatic disease.  In addition a small area of nodularity in the
 left upper lung is most compatible with metastatic disease.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.  No
 definite displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for worsening metastatic disease in the
 chest.
