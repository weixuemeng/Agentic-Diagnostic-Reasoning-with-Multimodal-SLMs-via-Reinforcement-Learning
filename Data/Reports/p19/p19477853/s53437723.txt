 margin, presumably tumor.  Right pigtail and larger thoracostomy drainage
 tubes are in place in the right lower chest laterally as before.
 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has increased, along with small left pleural effusion and
 left basal consolidation. Heart size is indeterminate, since the right heart
 border is obscured.
 Left PIC line ends in the lower SVC.  No left pneumothorax.
