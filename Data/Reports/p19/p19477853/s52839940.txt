 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 17:04
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hydropneumothorax, for followup.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 11:57.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 17:04 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in size of a right-sided pneumothorax with basilar chest
 tube remaining in place.  The right lung continues to appear heterogeneous in
 opacity consistent with the known right upper lobe mass and nodularity
 consistent with metastatic disease.  Left lung is well inflated.  There is a
 stable low-attenuation 5 mm nodular opacity lying along the inferior aspect of
 the fourth left posterior rib.  The left lung is otherwise clear.  No left
 effusion.  The left heart border is unchanged.  Evaluation of mediastinal
 contours is challenging given the entrapped right lung.  No definite right
 effusion is appreciated.
