                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 738 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax, followup.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 738 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right pleural catheter remains in place, and there is a stable right
 moderate-sized pneumothorax.  The right lung remains encased and has a very
 heterogeneous attenuation which likely reflects a combination of a known right
 upper lobe mass and nodularity consistent with metastatic disease.  Left lung
 remains well inflated and clear with the exception of a 5 mm nodular opacity
 projecting over the left fourth posterior rib.  No left effusion or left
 pneumothorax.  Left heart border is stable.  Right heart and mediastinal
 contours cannot be assessed due to the right lung process.
