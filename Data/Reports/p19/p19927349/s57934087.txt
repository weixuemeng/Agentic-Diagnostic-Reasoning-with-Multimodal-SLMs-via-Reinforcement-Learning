                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently reported right upper lobe abnormality on CTA has rapidly
 cleared radiographically.  Residual patchy and linear opacities within the
 right middle lobe and both lower lobes with associated volume loss appear
 relatively similar to the prior CT study.  Small right pleural effusion is
 also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1.  Rapid resolution of right upper lobe opacities, which were
 most likely due to aspiration given the rapid clearance.  
 2. Residual right middle and bilateral lower lobe opacities with volume loss
 are likely due to atelectasis, but coexistent infection is not excluded.
