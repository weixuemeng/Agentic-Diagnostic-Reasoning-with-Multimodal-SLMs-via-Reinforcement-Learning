                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 16:00
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with supraglottic edema, reintubated,
 evaluate ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:14.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film dated ___ at 16:00 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 4-5 cm
 above the carina, which is difficult to visualize on the current study.  Right
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC and nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Increasing airspace opacity at the left base with an associated layering
 effusion is seen likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 given patient rotation on the current examination.
