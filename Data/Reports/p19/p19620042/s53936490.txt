                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 19:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recently advanced endotracheal tube,
 check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:34.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 19:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube now has its tip 3.7 cm above the carina.  Right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 courses below diaphragm with tip not identified.  The lung volumes remain low
 with persistent retrocardiac opacity and probable layering effusion consistent
 with compressive atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There
 is also likely patchy atelectasis at the right medial lung base.  No pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contour is stable
 given differences in patient rotation.
