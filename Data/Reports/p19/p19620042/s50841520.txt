                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal edema with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy opacifications
 at the bases are consistent with small effusions and compressive atelectasis,
 more prominent on the left.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
