                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Seizure, concerning for new stroke.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is too low and should be pulled back since it is currently
 less than 1 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Lung volumes
 are very low which exaggerate the size of the cardiac silhouette.  Bibasilar
 opacities most likely reflect atelectasis although aspiration in the left
 lower lobe in particular cannot be entirely excluded.  Repeated radiograph is
 recommended.
