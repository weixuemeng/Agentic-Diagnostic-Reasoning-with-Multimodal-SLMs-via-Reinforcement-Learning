                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:14.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intubation, fever. Assess for interval
 change.  Thick secretions.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 19:29.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central
 line unchanged.  Increasing airspace opacities at both bases most likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of relatively low lung
 volumes and the presence of a layering left effusion.  However, bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
