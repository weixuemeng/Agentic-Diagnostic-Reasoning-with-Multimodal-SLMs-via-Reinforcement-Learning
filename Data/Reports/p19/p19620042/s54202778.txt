                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Seizures, worsening respiratory status.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 02:57 a.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina.  The right internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.
 
 Bibasilar opacities appear to be slightly progressed since the prior study as
 the lung volumes are lower.  Small amount of pleural effusion is noted
 bilaterally, potentially underestimated on the current examination.  The
 patient is in minimal interstitial edema with no overt failure sign seen.
