                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and reference chest radiograph from___
 the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates normal lung volumes. 
 Costophrenic angles are blunted bilaterally, suggestive of small pleural
 effusions.  There is moderate cardiomegaly and upper lobe vascular
 redistribution are chronic.  Predominantly bibasilar redistribution of
 airspace opacities over the past three hours is good evidence that the process
 is hydrostatic edema.  The most pronounced opacification, in the right upper
 lobe, abutting the minor fissure, might well be concurrent pneumonia.  Hilar
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Descending aorta is slightly
 tortuous with aortic arch calcifications.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions, edema have slightly
 improved since ___ exam. Possible right upper lobe pneumonia.
