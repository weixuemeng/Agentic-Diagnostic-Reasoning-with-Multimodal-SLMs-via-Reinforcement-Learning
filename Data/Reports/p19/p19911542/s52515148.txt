                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of congestive heart failure with dyspnea
 after initial diuresis at outside hospital.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates cardiomegaly, moderate, grossly unchanged since the
 prior study.  There are bilateral interstitial opacities, consistent with
 moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is asymmetry in the appearance
 of the right upper lobe perihilar area which might reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, but infectious process or hilar mass cannot be excluded. 
 Reevaluation of the patient is recommended after diuresis.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion is part of the congestive heart failure
 process seen as pulmonary edema and pleural fluid.  No pneumothorax is seen.
