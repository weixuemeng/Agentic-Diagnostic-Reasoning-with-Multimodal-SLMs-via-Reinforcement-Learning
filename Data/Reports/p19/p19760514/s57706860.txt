                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax status post chest tube removal in
 patient recently undergone TVR.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is a small right apical
 pneumothorax with no evidence of tension.  Compared to the prior radiograph,
 the endotracheal and orogastric tubes have been removed.  The lung volumes are
 low.  There is left basilar volume loss due to a small pleural effusion and
 probable associated atelectasis which may have been present on the prior
 study, but is now layering due to upright patient position.  The sternal
 cerclage wires are intact.  The Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged. 
 Post-surgical cardiac and mediastinal widening is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension
 2.  Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 3.  Interval removal of endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
