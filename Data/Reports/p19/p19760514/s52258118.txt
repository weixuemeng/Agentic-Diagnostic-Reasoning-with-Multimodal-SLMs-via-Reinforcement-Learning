                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with decreased breath sounds and clinical concern
 for rib fracture.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.  The heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unremarkable.  Opacity at the right lung base is compatible with components of
 atelectasis of the anterior-basal segment of the right lower lobe as well as a
 small right pleural effusion.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggests a trace amount of pleural fluid in that location.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with right lower lobe anterior-basal
 segment collapse; trace left pleural effusion.
