 No nasogastric tube is identified on this chest radiograph, but a subsequent
 chest radiograph performed later the same date documents a tube in place. 
 Interval worsening of left lower lobe collapse, with adjacent persistent small
 to moderate left pleural effusion as well as slight increase in nonspecific
 left perihilar opacification. Small, partially layering right pleural effusion
 is apparently new.  No other relevant changes.
