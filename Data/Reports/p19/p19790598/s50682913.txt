                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with atrial fibrillation.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Hazy linear
 opacities at the left lung base are most suggestive of atelectasis.  There is
 right lateral scarring versus atelectasis also seen.  Elsewhere, lungs are
 clear and there is no large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Findings most
 suggestive of left basilar atelectasis; however, clinical correlation is
 suggested.  Repeat PA and lateral may offer additional detail.
