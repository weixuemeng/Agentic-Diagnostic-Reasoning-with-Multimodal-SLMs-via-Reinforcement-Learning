                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old the mild presents after fall. Evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, and the lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.  Vertebral body height loss
 in the mid-lower thoracic spine is again noted, and degenerative changes are
 seen in the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fractures are seen. If
 clinical concern for rib fracture is high, dedicated rib series or CT is more
 sensitive.
