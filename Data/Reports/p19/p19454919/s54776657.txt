                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with upper abdominal pain.  History of end-stage
 renal disease, on hemodialysis.  Question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings seen throughout.  Increased hazy bibasilar opacities are in
 part due to overlying gynecomastia; however, prominent interstitial markings
 are likely in part accountable for this finding.  There is no confluent
 consolidation or large effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  Free air is seen below the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen throughout suggestive
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomegaly.  No free air below the
 diaphragm.  No other large confluent consolidation.
