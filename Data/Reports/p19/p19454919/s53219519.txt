                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Probable pancreatitis; question effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pleural effusions are suspected.  Mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly appears unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours, including
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery contour, appear stable.  Patchy left
 basilar opacification is not entirely specific but most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  Bones are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small suspected bilateral pleural effusions and patchy left
 basilar opacification, most likely due to atelectasis.
