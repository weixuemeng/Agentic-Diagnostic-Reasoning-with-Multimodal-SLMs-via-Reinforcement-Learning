                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with SVT and syncope.  Question cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are clear
 of focal consolidation.  Linear opacity at left lung base suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Nodular opacity projects over the anterior left first rib,
 potentially within it or in the left lung apex.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process or cardiomegaly.  Nodular
 opacity projecting over the left lung apex, potentially within the rib or
 lung.  Dedicated two-view chest with apical lordotic view suggested when
 patient is amenable for further characterization.
