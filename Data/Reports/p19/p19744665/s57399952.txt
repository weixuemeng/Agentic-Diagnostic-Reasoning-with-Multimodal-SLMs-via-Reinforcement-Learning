                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The reported abnormality on the prior study appears quite dense,
 measuring about 8 mm in diameter and continuing to overlie the left anterior
 first rib.  This may reflect a small bone island and less likely an apical
 lung nodule.  There has been apparent previous surgery in the left hemithorax
 with changes suggestive of left thoracotomy, accompanied by mild volume loss
 and areas of parenchymal and pleural scarring.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta
 is mildly tortuous.  Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense left apical nodular opacity is not fully localized or
 characterized on this study but probably reflects a small bone island or
 calcified right apical granuloma.  As the patient has apparently had prior
 surgery, there are likely prior outside radiographs that could be procured for
 comparison.  This may be helpful to document retrospective stability and to
 avoid the need for further imaging such as a CT scan.
