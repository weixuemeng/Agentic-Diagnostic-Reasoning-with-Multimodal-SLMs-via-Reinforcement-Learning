                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with pna  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Airspace opacities within the left lower lobe and lingula obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm and left heart border, respectively. There is a probable
 superimposed small-moderate left pleural effusion. Streaky right basilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits. Possible calcified left hilar node is noted. No acute
 osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left base opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm likely due to a
 combination of consolidation in the setting of infection with superimposed
 effusion.
 2. Streaky right basilar opacities, may reflect pneumonia or atelectasis.
