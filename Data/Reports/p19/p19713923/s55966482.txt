 obscured by an overlying hand.  Allowing for the limitations, there is no
 consolidation.  Blunting of left costophrenic angle may be a small pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to
 optimal positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam is limited due to poor patient positioning.  Allowing for limitations,
 there is no radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
