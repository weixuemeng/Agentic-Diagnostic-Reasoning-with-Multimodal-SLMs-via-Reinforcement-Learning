                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 Lung volumes are very low, probably accounting for streaky opacities in the
 posterior lower lobes suggesting minor atelectasis.  A  mildly prominent
 interstitial abnormality could suggest mild congestion but is of uncertain
 significance noting very low lung volumes which may exaggerate substantially
 exaggerate normal interstitial markings.
 
 IMPRESSION: Very low lung volumes; mild interstitial prominence, possibly
 within normal range for technique versus mild congestion or diffuse
 inflammatory change.
