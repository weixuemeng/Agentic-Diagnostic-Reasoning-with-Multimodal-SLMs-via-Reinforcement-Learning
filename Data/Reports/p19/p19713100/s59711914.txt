                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiograph from ___ and from
 ___.
 
 SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Patient is rotated and supine, preventing
 strict comparison to prior studies. Opacification of the left lung base
 appears similar compared to multiple prior examinations and likely reflects a
 combination of moderate pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, but
 perhaps new consolidation and/or increase in left pleural effusion.  Linear
 opacity in the right lung base is suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Prominent interstitial markings are likely secondary to AP supine technique
 and bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to basilar
 opacities.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent left basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion, new pneumonia
 and/or increase in pleural effusion may well be present. Conventional
 radiographs recommended, when feasible.
 2.  Probable subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base.
 3.  No overt pulmonary edema.
