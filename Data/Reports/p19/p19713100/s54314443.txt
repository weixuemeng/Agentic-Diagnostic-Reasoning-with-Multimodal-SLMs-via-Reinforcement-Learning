                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Today's image suggests that this
 elevation is caused by a hyperinflated stomach.
 
 Subsequent areas of retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 Normal-appearing lung parenchyma.  Otherwise, without evidence of pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.
