 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is persistent
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  A lucency projecting over the right
 upper abdomen is slightly more conspicuous than on the prior image, to exclude
 potential small pneumothorax.  Close clinical and radiographic followup is
 recommended.  The findings were discussed at the time of the initial image
 evaluation.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the lung parenchyma.
