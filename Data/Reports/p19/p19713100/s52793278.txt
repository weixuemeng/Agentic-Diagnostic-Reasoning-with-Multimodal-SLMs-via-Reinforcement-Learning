 with mild calcification of the aortic arch.  Mild pulmonary edema appears
 slightly progressed compared to the previous exam.  Small pleural effusion is
 again demonstrated, with bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflective
 of atelectasis.  The left hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
