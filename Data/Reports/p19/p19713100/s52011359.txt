                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Heart size is difficult to assess given the low lung volumes, but is at least
 mildly enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is again noted, with small bilateral pleural effusions
 visualized.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is seen although the left apex is obscured due to the
 patient's chin projecting over this region.  Bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques are again demonstrated, compatible with prior asbestos exposure. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with DISH are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Calcified pleural plaques indicative of prior asbestos
 exposure.
