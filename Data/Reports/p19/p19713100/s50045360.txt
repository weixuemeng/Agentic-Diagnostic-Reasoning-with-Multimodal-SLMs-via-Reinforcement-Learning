                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness and saturating to ___%.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent from ___.  A
 chest CTA from ___ was also analyzed for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior exam, there has been interval slight worsening
 of bilateral interstitial opacities, with associated hilar engorgement and
 vascular upper redistribution.  Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen. 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is not significantly changed from prior,
 although there is some obscuration of the lateral left hemidiaphragm which may
 be due to overlying ateletasis and a small left pleural effusion.  Cardiac
 contour cannot be fully assessed due to partial obscuration of the left heart
 border, but is grossly stable.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  An
 ill-defined hyperdensity between the fourth and fifth sternotomy wires is not
 clearly seen in the lateral view and may be external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings suggest minimal interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Stable elevated hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible
 small/trace left pleural effusion.
