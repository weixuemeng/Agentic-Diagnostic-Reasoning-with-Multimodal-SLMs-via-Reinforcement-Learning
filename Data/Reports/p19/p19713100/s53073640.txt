                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT abdomen ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is chronic, and there is
 associated left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear relatively unchanged, without evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Focal areas of calcification projecting over left mid lung field
 are compatible with calcified pleural plaques and are unchanged.  Streaky
 linear opacity in the right lung base also likely reflects atelectasis.  There
 is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine are re-demonstrated, and mild degenerative changes also
 noted in both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic elevation of left hemidiaphragm with associated left
 basilar atelectasis.  Streaky opacity in the right lung base is also likely
 atelectasis.  No definite evidence for congestive heart failure.
