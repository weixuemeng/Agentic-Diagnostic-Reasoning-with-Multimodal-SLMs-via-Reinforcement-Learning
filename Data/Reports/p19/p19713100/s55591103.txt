                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain for three weeks.  Also, new
 asymptomatic hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show plate-like opacity in the right lower
 lobe.  Moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  The cardiac
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Again noted are calcified pleural
 plaques along the left hemidiaphragm.  The mediastinal silhouette is mildly
 widened likely related to vascular engorgment.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New right lower lobe plate-like atelectasis.  Unchanged calcified pleural
 plaques.
