                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough with fever and chills for the past week,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  High-resolution chest
 CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study of ___, there is
 increased opacity at the left lung base, which in the setting of a productive
 cough and fever raises concern for pneumonia.  However, a remote prior chest
 CT from ___ demonstrates bibasilar fibrotic changes and the increased
 markings in the left lung base may also represent progression of the patient's
 chronic lung disease/emphysema.  Right apical pleural thickening is also seen,
 which is similar to the prior chest radiograph and chest CT.  The lung volumes
 remain decreased.  Irregularity of the peripheral pulmonary vasculature is
 compatible with emphysema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no evidence
 of overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of chronic lung disease/emphysema with increased
 opacity at the left lung base which given symptoms of fever and cough raises
 concern for a superimposed pneumonia.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 5
 p.m. on ___.
