  Chronic changes in the lungs without definite focal consolidation.  Increased
  soft tissue in the region of the right paratracheal stripe, potentially
  related to adjacent right apical scarring and AP technique, however underlying
  adenopathy is possible.  Suggest repeat exam with PA technique if patient is
  amenable or alternatively CT scan for re-evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p fall with pelvic tenderness  // ___F s/p fall with pelvic
 tenderness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs which are
 chronic likely due to underlying interstitial process.  Lower lung volumes
 seen on the current exam and subsequent retrocardiac opacity is likely due to
 atelectasis.  There is no effusion or overt edema.  Right apical scarring is
 again noted.  This may also cause increased opacity at the right paratracheal
 stripe region however underlying lesions such as adenopathy is difficult to
 exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 soft tissue in the region of the right paratracheal stripe, potentially
