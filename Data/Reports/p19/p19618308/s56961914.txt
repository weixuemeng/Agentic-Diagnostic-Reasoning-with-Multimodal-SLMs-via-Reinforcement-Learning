                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  This is a ___-year-old woman with elevated white count after a fall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since ___,
 most recently ___:
 
 Lungs are generally hyperinflated, chronic finding, but without radiographic
 evidence on interim torso CT, ___, of emphysema or bronchial
 inflammation.  Blunting of the left lateral pleural sulcus is a chronic
 finding, but posterior blunting is new, indicating a small left pleural
 effusion is new.  Right pleural space is normal.  Lungs are clear of focal
 abnormality.  Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  A small bulge in the apical
 portion of the left cardiac border on the frontal view is not seen on any of
 the prior chest radiographs, and is of uncertain significance.  Occasionally a
 coronary artery aneurysm will present in this fashion, but that is likely to
 be clinically apparent.  Therefore, correlation with recent clinical
 developments is indicated.
 
 A small lozenge is present in the esophagus just below the level of the
 carina.  This does not necessarily mean there is an esophageal stricture or
 even dysmotility, in a patient of this age.
 
 There is no pneumonia.  Dr. ___ was paged.
