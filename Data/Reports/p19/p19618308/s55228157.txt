                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DVT and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate an
 unchanged left chest wall pacemaker with right atrial and ventricular leads. 
 There is a small left pleural effusion, unchanged.  Additionally, mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is present, although there is some increase in focal
 consolidation at the left base which may be attributable to an infectious
 process.  The opacification in the retrocardiac region may also be a function
 of atelectasis and developing pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis with increased retrocardiac opacity which
 may represent left lower lobe pneumonia.
