                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension and leukocytosis.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Leads of a left
 chest wall pacer terminate in the right atrium and ventricle.  Lung volumes
 are decreased, exaggerating heart size, which appears mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are otherwise stable.  Pulmonary edema has increased
 since the prior exam with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or aspiration.  No
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar lung opacities that may represent atelectasis or aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
