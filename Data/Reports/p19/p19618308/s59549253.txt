                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left-sided pacemaker implantation.  Evaluate lead
 positions and rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a newly
 placed left chest wall pacemaker generator with a right atrial and ventricular
 leads appropriately positioned.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there is unchanged left pleural effusion and right basilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. No acute
 pneumonia is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of left chest wall pacemaker with
 appropriately positioned right atrial and ventricular leads.  No pneumothorax.
