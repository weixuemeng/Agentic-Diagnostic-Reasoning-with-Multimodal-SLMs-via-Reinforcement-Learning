                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___, PA and lateral
 chest radiograph from ___, chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with ___, there is mild increase in blunting
 of the left hemidiaphragm, with a most conspicuous meniscus seen in the left
 posterior costophrenic sulcus in the lateral view compatible with increasing
 pleural effusion.  Biapical scarring is present but there is no focal opacity
 to suggest pneumonia.  Cardiac size is mildly enlarged, but otherwise the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 right-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly worsening left-sided pleural effusion. No evidence of
 pneumonia.
