                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  New heterogeneous opacities have developed in the right upper lobe,
 some of which have a slightly nodular configuration.  Lungs are otherwise
 remarkable for linear atelectasis at the left lung base.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Small pleural effusions are new, left
 greater than right.  Bilateral shoulder prostheses are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New heterogeneous right upper lobe opacities consistent with an evolving
 pneumonia.  Poorly defined nodular opacities in this region may reflect
 coalescing acinar nodules from coalescing airspace disease, but atypical
 infection should also be considered given the history of immune suppression.
 
 Dr. ___ has been telephoned with this result at 4:15 p.m. on ___
 at the time of discovery.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
