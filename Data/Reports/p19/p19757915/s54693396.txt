                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with heart failure and rhonchi, evaluate for consolidation,
 effusion, or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged but stable.  Hilar contours are enlarged, possibly
 secondary to underlying pulmonary hypertension, but there is no pulmonary
 edema.  A left chest pacemaker has leads in the appropriate positions in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidations or pleural effusions.
