                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The main pulmonary artery
 contour is markedly enlarged, which raises concern for underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.  Vascular calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  Aside
 from a similar streaky atelectasis at the left lung base, the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no evidence for congestive heart failure.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild spinal degenerative changes are
 similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or significant change.  Enlargement
 of the main pulmonary artery, worrisome for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
