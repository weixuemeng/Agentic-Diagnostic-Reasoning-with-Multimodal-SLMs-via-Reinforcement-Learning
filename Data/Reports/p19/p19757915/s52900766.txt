                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight gain, history of congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta again noted.  Hilar contours are stable, and there is no
 pulmonary edema demonstrated.  Vague focal opacity is seen within the right
 upper to mid lung field, which is nonspecific, but not clearly demonstrated on
 the previous exam.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is otherwise demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of congestive heart failure.  
 
 Vague focal opacity projecting over the right upper to mid lung field, which
 is nonspecific.  This could potentially reflect an inflammatory or infectious
 focus, but follow up radiographs are recommended to assess for resolution of
 this finding.
