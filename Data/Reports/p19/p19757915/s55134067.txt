                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset shortness of breath, atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged compared to prior study.  Enlargement of the hila
 bilaterally is also stable, which may be related to pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The aortic knob demonstrates mild calcifications.  There is
 minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
