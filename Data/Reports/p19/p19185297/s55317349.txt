                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged with continued widening of the mediastinum. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm persists
 with a small right pleural effusion again noted. Patchy bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Fiducial markers
 are seen within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, with chronic elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm and small right pleural effusion.
