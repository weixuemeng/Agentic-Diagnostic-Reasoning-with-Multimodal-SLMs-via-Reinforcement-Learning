                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post multiple surgeries now with increasing white blood cell
 count and platelet count.  Evaluate for pneumonia or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.  A right nipple shadow is noted and should not be mistaken for an
 intraparenchymal lesion.  The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal structures
 are unremarkable.
