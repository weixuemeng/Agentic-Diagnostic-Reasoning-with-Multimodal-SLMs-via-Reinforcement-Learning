                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views

 History: ___M with O2 requirement and sob pls eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis. Prominence of the hila may be due to low volume overload.
 Bibasilar opacities may relate to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although underlying consolidation due to infection cannot be
 excluded on this study. The cardiac silhouette appears at least mildly
 enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis in combination with
 prominence of the hila and enlarged cardiac silhouette, could be due to
 CHF/fluid overload in the appropriate clinical setting. Alternatively,
 infectious process is not excluded, nor is underlying hilar adenopathy.
 Suggest repeat after diuresis for further evaluation. .
