                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Large left-sided effusion status post chest tube placement followup.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___ at 22:57 p.m. and allowing for differences in
 positioning, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Left chest tube is present, similar in configuration, with subcutaneous
 emphysema along the left chest wall.
 
 Again seen is a large left effusion, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm
 and the cardiac borders.   Degree of opacity in the left mid-zone may be
 slightly greater, though this could reflect some parenchymal collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Interstitial markings in the left upper zone are again
 increased.  However, the right lung remains grossly clear, without CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Continued opacification of the left mid and lower zones.  This is slightly
 worse, but could reflect some underlying pulmonary parenchymal changes, rather
 than increased pleural fluid.  The true extent of the pleural effusion cannot
 be distinguished from the parenchymal changes on this upright film.
