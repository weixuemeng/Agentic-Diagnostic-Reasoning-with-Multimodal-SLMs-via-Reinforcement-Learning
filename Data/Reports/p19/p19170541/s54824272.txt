 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent splenectomy, now presents with
 fever, question acute process in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the
 prior exam, there has been development of consolidation in the left lower
 lobe, which could represent pneumonia or atelectasis and probable adjacent
 effusion.  The patient is known to have adjacent rib fractures and the
 possibility of a hemothorax is not excluded.  The right lung remains clear. 
 Heart size is difficult to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly
 stable.  The known rib fractures are better seen on the prior CT scan.  Vein
 in the left upper abdomen is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.  Left effusion, cannot exclude hemothorax given patient's known
 adjacent rib fractures as seen on the prior CT torso.
