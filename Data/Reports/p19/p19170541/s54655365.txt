                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy after MCC. 
 Evaluate left chest tube, pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, the degree of subcutaneous emphysema along the left
 chest wall has increased. On today's exam, two lines or drains and additional
 pigtail catheter overlie the left upper abdomen, while only one tube was seen
 on the prior film. 
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is the left-sided
 chest tube, with interstitial and alveolar opacities in the left lung and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax identified.   The
 chest tube tip and side port overlie the lower left lung.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared with one day earlier, interval increase in  subcutaneous
 emphysema along the left chest wall and new or better visualized upper left
 abdominal drains    Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
