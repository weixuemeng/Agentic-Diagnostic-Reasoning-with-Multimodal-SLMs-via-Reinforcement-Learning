  1.  Right lower lobe opacity could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate
  clinical situation. Close interval follow-up after treatment is recommended.
  This patient could benefit from a non-emergent Chest CT if he has not had any
  before.
  2. Background emphysema.
  3. Possible 5 mm right peripheral mid lung nodule versus a vascular marking.
  Correlate with any prior imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased right infrahilar opacity could reflect
 aspiration and pneumonia.  There appears to be mild peribronchiolar
 thickening.  The minor fissure with is depressed, suggesting some degree of
 atelectasis in the right lung.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lung may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Background
 hyperlucency of the lungs suggests emphysema.  An approximately 5 mm the
 opacity in this periphery of the right midlung could be a vessel on and,
 however pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Probable 4-mm calcified
 granuloma in the left periphery of the lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 clinical situation.  Close interval follow-up after treatment is recommended. 
 This patient could benefit from a non-emergent Chest CT if he has not had any

 2.  Background emphysema.
