                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sensation of aspiration.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is an opacity in the
 lingula, as well as faint opacities in the mid and upper right lung.  Aside
 from mild pulmonary vascular congestion, the hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Faint multifocal opacities in the lungs bilaterally may be secondary to
 aspiration. Continued close interval follow up is recommended.
