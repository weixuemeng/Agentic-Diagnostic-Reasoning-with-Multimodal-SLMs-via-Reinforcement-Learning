                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, recent GI bleed.  Question consolidation, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  The heart is likely
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF.  No gross effusion.  No frank
 consolidation.  Probable minimal atelectasis at both bases.
