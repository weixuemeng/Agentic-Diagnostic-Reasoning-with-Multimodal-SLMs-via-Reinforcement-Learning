 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:50 AM
  In comparison to the examination dated ___ at 20:06, the
  endotracheal tube has been advanced into satisfactory position.  The cardiac
  silhouette remains stably prominent.  The pulmonary vasculature is more
  indistinct.  Visceral fluid is again seen with possible interlobular septal
  thickening.  In addition, more prominent, confluent opacity is seen in the
  right lower lung field, which may be related to edema, though underlying
  aspiration or other infection is not excluded.
