                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and lethargy with lithium toxicity.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are low in
 volume with an opacity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with
 normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe could reflect
 atelectasis particularly given low lung volumes, however infection should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Consider repeat evaluation
 with improved inspiration when patient is able.
