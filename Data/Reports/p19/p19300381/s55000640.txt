                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unsteady gait, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the area of increased
 opacification in the right mid zone has decreased and has a more linear
 quality.  This could reflect merely atelectatic changes that are less
 prominent, given the better inspiration.  Nevertheless, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, a supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.
