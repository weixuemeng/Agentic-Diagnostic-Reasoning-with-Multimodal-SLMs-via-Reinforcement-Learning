                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, new murmur. Dullness and diminished air
 movement at b/l bases  // ? infiltrate / effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous ___ CT chest x-rays on PACs record for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits, allowing for mild unfolding of the aorta.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, with minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank consolidation or gross
 effusion.  Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Old
 healed fractures of the right eighth and ninth ribs noted.
 
 At the upper edge of these films, note is made of advanced degenerative change
 in the cervical spine, not fully evaluated.  Scattered right carotid artery
 calcifications are also likely present.  At the inferior edge of these films,
 therefore rounded densities overlying the left upper quadrant --___
 pills.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF
 2. Elevated right hemidiaphragm and minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic, similar to an outside scanned in radiograph from ___
 (from ___),
 3. Minimal atelectasis at the right and left bases, but no focal infiltrate
 identified to suggest pneumonia.
