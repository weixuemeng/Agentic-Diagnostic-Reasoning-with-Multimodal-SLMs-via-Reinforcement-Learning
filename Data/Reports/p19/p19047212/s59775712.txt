                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  This report should have read, "Mild interstitial edema and small

 difficult to exclude concurrent pneumonia but not necessary to explain their
 appearance. Mild cardiomegaly, with particular left atrial enlargement, is
 unchanged since the only prior chest radiograph, on ___."
