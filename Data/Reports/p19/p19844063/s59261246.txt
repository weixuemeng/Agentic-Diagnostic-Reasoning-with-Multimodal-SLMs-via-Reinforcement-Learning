 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of orogastric tube, terminating within the
 stomach, which appears moderately distended.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 improved atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.  Otherwise, no relevant
 short interval change.
