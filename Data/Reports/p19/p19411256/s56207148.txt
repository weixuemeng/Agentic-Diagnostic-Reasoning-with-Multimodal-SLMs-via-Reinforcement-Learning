                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD.  Heart size is
 normal.  The aorta remains tortuous with scattered calcifications.  Calcified
 left upper lobe granuloma and calcified right mediastinal lymph node suggests
 prior granulomatous disease.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus likely reflects chronic pleural thickening or scarring. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
