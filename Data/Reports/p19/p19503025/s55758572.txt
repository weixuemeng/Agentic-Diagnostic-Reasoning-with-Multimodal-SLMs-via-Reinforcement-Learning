                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs remain relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  Platelike right base atelectasis is seen.  There are
 subtle scattered areas of opacity projecting over the lateral left upper to
 mid lung, and possibly to a lesser extent over the right lung, which may be
 related patient's known metastatic disease, but underlying infection is not
 excluded.  There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles and trace
 pleural effusions may be present.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral nodular opacities may relate to patient's known at metastatic
 disease, however, findings appear worse as compared to ___ which may be
 due to progression of disease, however, superimposed infectious process is not
 excluded.
 
 Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
