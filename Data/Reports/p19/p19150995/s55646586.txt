 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with GI bleed and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA neck from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  The lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting prominence of the upper
 mediastinum, which is due to tortuosity of the vessels as seen on CTA neck
 recently performed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable
 with a tortuous descending thoracic aorta.  Degenerative change is seen at the
 right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
