                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiograph 11:18 a.m. from outside institution,
 outside chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Opacities in the posterior left lower lobe are
 suggestive of atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacities suggesting atelectasis.  No potential
 nodules are visualized on this study, possibly due to decreased lung volumes,
 but please note the prior recommendation to follow-up with a PA view using
 nipple markers.
