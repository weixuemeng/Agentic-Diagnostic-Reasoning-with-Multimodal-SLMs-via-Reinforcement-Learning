  1. Left midlung airspace opacification may represent acute pneumonia or a
  parenchymal mass.  Consider chest CT for further evaluation, if not artery
  performed elsewhere.
  2. Mild volume overload including pulmonary vascular congestion, trace edema,
  and likely a small right pleural effusion.
  3. Extensive pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with respiratory distress, evaluate for acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dense left mid lung airspace opacification may represent a superior subsegment
 left lower lobe pneumonia or parenchymal mass.  Nodular densities project over
 the lungs bilaterally consistent with pleural plaques related to prior
 asbestos exposure.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with trace
 pulmonary edema.  There is probably a small right pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative
 changes are partially assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left midlung airspace opacification may represent acute pneumonia or a
 parenchymal mass.  Should be evaluated by chest CT if not recently performed.
 2. Mild volume overload including pulmonary vascular congestion, trace edema,
 and likely a small right pleural effusion.
 3. Extensive pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
