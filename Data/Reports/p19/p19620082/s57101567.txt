 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  There is slight prominence of the interstitial
 markings diffusely bilaterally which is most likely due to chronic lung
 disease, although minimal interstitial edema is not excluded.  Areas of
 bilateral costochondral calcifications are seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 or focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight diffuse prominence of the bilateral interstitial markings most likely
 relates to chronic lung disease however, mild interstitial edema is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation.
