                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent cough and near fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT torso from that same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution and indistinctness of pulmonary
 vascularity suggesting borderline congestion, although not striking.  As seen
 previously, the left costophrenic sulcus appears effaced with patchy streaky
 opacities at the lung bases, but without substantial change suggesting a more
 chronic form of basilar atelectasis.  A moderate hiatal hernia, seen on the
 prior CT is not visible on this study.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bones appear demineralized.  There are mild similar
 degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline findings suggesting vascular congestion.  Patchy
 basilar opacities, but with little if any change and more suggestive of
 chronic atelectasis or scarring than acute pneumonia, although it is difficult
 to completely exclude an ongoing infectious process.
