                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, likely CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Evidence of DISH is seen along
 the visualized spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and enlarged cardiac silhouette suggest CHF.
