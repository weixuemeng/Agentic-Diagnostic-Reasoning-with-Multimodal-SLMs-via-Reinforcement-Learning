                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage, now with fever. 
 Assess for pulmonary infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right approach PICC terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding, however, no new consolidation is identified.  There
 is no overt interstitial edema or large pleural effusions.  Moderate
 mediastinal widening is unchanged compared to earliest available prior
 (___), though could reflect aortic enlargement.  Enteric catheter courses
 below the diaphragm with the tip in the region of the stomach, though
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes, though no definite consolidation.
 2. Unchanged mediastinal widening may be due to a dilated aorta. 
 Cross-sectional imaging would be recommended for confirmation.
