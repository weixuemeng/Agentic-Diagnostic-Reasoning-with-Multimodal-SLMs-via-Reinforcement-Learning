                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Pre-operative planning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and more recent CT dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new vague opacities in the right mid to lower lung, probably for the
 most part within the lower lobe.  Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague right lung opacities.  These are not specific but may indicate pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting. Correlation with clinical presentation is
 suggested.  If an unusual appearance of atelectasis or asymmetric pulmonary
 congestion may explain the findings, and for general reassessment, short-term
 repeat radiographs may be helpful.
