                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Found down.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged with tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta with dense aortic calcifications.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is a right lung base atelectasis with more dense
 consolidation in the right mid lung field with layering posterior pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Calcified pleural plaques are noted in
 the lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation of the right mid lung field with associated
 right-sided pleural effusion as well as biapical calcified pleural plaques
 which are better described on same-day CT examination.  This could represent
 infection or mass.
