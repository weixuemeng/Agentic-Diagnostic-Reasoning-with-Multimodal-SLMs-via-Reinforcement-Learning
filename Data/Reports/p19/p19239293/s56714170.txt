 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pericardial effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pericardial drain is in
 unchanged position.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has not substantially
 changed.  The lung volumes, however, have improved, potentially reflecting
 improved ventilation.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
