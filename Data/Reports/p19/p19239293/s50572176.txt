 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tamponade on ultrasound.  Evaluate cardiac
 silhouette.

 focal consolidation or large effusion.  There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Prosthetic valve and median sternotomy wires identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which could be due to
 cardiomegaly, although given history and configuration, pericardial effusion
 is certainly possible.
