                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CVA, CHF, and now septic.  Please Eval for
 pna and interval change in signs of volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re- demonstration of a small amount of presumed free subdiaphragmatic air
 below left hemidiaphragm, described previously as the likely a consequence of
 recent percutaneous G-tube placement.  On this semi-erect view, it is
 difficult to evaluate for interval change.
 
 Persistent mild pulmonary edema, without new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Small bilateral effusions are unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent presumed free left subdiaphragmatic air due to recent G-tube
 placement, as discussed with the clinician yesterday.  On this semi-erect
 view, it is difficult to evaluate for interval change.
 
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
