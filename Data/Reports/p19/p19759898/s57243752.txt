 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pnx on antibx Rx  / evidence for improvement
 effectiveness of therapy;  h/o chf and on PD for CKD  // ___ year old man with

 increased in comparison to approximately 3 weeks prior.  There is faint
 extension of these opacities into the midlung fields.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities may be consistent with an infectious process,
 chronic changes from recurrent pulmonary edema, or other inflammatory process.
 Recommend CT chest for further evaluation when fluid status is optimized.
