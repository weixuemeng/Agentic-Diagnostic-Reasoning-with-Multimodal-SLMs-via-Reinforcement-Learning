                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress with new endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.7 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube tip
 courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 There is upper zone vascular redistribution and mild perihilar haziness
 compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacities in the lung bases could reflect aspiration, atelectasis or
 infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.  Ossific density is seen projecting over the
 right acromion and distal right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but aspiration and
 infection are not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
