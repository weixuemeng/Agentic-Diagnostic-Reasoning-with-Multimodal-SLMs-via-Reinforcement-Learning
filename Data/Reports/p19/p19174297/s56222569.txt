                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of chronic hyponatremia,
 asthma/COPD, ethanol abuse, presenting with unresponsiveness and profound
 hyponatremia.  Study requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semiupright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina, likely
 related to changes in chin positioning. Right IJ venous catheter and enteric
 tube are in unchanged position.   Lower lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is mild vascular engorgement and early
 pulmonary edema.  No definite pneumonia or pleural effusions identified.  An
 ossific density is again seen over the right acromion and distal right
 clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and early pulmonary edema.
