                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical ventilation and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, overlying 
 material somewhat obscures detail.  Probable atelectatic changes at the bases,
 but no definite focal pneumonia.  Monitoring and support devices remain in
 position.
