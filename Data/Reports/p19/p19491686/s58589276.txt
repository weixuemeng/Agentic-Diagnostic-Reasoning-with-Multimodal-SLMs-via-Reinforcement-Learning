                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p CVL placement  // Confirm L CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 08:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter which terminates in the mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Relative lucency over the upper chest consistent with pulmonary
 emphysema.  Re- demonstrated are bibasilar, right greater than left,
 consolidations worrisome for multifocal pneumonia and/ or aspiration.  The
 right base consolidation appears slightly more consolidated as compared to 3
 hr prior.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Right greater than left bibasilar consolidations, slightly more consolidative
 on the right, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia and/ or aspiration.
 
 Re- demonstrated pulmonary emphysema.  .
