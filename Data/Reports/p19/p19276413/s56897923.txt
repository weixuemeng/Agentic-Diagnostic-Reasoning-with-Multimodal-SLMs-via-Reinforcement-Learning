                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the degree of pulmonary vascular
 congestion is less prominent, though there is still substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid.  There is also a small
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis on the right.
 
 Axillary clips on the right are again seen.
