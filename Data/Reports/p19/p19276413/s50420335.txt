 and hilar contours are mildly prominent consistent with mild cardiomegaly
 unchanged from prior exam.  No pneumothorax is noted.  A small left pleural
 effusion with associated compressive left basilar atelectasis is slightly
 worse compared to prior exam.  Platelike bibasilar atelectasis is noted. 
 Compression fractures involving the mid thoracic vertebrae are unchanged since
 the most recent prior exam.  Atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid
 arteries is noted bilaterally.
