                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Lethargy and leukocytosis with decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and more recent chest radiograph dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post aortic valve replacement surgery. Mitral annular
 calcifications are prominent.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  There is increasing
 opacity at the left lung base including involvement of much of the left lower
 lobe with an opacity suggesting pneumonia.  There is probably a coinciding
 pleural effusion.  Better delineated is a small and probably new pleural
 effusion on the right.  Surgical clips project over the right axilla and
 epigastric region.  Thoracic compression fractures are unchanged.  The bones
 appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left basilar opacification suggesting pneumonia in the left lower
 lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
