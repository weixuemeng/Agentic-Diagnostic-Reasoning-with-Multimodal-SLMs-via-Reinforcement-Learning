                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Assess for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___; ___; ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded with diffuse bilateral heterogeneous
 interstitial and alveolar opacities.  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion
 with left lower lobe atelectasis is seen. The right pleural surface is normal.
 No pneumothorax.  The heart is partially obscured by pleural effusion;
 however, is enlarged with mediastinal vein dilatation.  Mediastinal contour is
 otherwise unremarkable and there is prominence of the hilum bilaterally. 
 Sternotomy wires are unchanged in position and are intact.  Right axillary
 clips, mitral annulus calcification, and valvular replacement are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema with increased moderate left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Left lower lobe opacity likely represents left pleural effusion and
 atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.
