                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath and leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  Mitral
 annular calcifications are unchanged.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 mild interstitial abnormality, suggesting vascular congestion.  Streaky left
 basilar opacification with new mild relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is most suggestive of atelectasis.  The lateral view depicts an
 increased small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the right since the prior
 examination, but quite similar to before on the left.  Surgical clips project
 over the right axilla and epigastric region.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary congestion. 
 Increased volume loss at the left lung base.  Increased right-sided pleural
 effusion.
