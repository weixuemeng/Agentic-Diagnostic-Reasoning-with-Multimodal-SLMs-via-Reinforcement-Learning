                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest are provided.  These images
 demonstrate pulmonary vascular engorgement, mild interstitial pulmonary edema,
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 The pattern is most consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure
 however a concurrent infectious process in the lung bases cannot be fully
 excluded.  An artificial aortic valve surgical clips in the mediastinum and
 upper abdomen, and median sternotomy cerclage wires are present.
 
 There are multiple compression fractures in the thoracic spine which are
 stable for at least a year.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild decompensated congestive heart failure.  Concurrent infectious process at
 the lung bases cannot be fully excluded.
