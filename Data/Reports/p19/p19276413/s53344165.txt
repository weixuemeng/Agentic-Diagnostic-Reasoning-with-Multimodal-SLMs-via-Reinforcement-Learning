                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute onset shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia, fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  There are surgical clips in
 the right axilla.  There is an increase in interstitial markings, particularly
 at the lung bases and worsening opacities, left greater than right.  Opacity
 of the left base obscures the hemidiaphragm and left heart border is due to a
 combination of increasing moderate pleural effusion and chronic consolidation.
 Underlying pneumonia is not excluded.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 There is no evidence of large pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, and
 moderate left pleural effusion which suggests pericardial effusion may also be
 present.
 
 Updated results telephoned to Dr. ___ by ___ at 8:45 am,
 ___, 10 minutes after discovery.
