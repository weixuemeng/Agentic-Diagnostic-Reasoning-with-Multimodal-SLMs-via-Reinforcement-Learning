                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:51 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CHF exacerbation and recurrent dyspnea. 
 Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Yesterday's mild pulmonary edema has improved.  There is more consolidation at
 the base of the left lung which is most commonly atelectasis but could be
 pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion is larger, presumably related to the
 residual of previous heart failure.  The heart is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mitral annulus
 is extremely heavily calcified, a condition which predisposes to mitral
 regurgitation.
