                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable retrocardiac opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-described left retrocardiac opacity has slightly increased.  In addition,
 there is now blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left, suggesting the
 presence of a small left pleural effusion.  Overall, these changes suggest the
 previously expressed concern for pneumonia, notably given the normal
 appearance of the left lung.
 
 Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.  Unchanged right
 internal jugular vein catheter.
