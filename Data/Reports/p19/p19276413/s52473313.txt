                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history AS, MR presenting ___/p fall  // R/O CHF,
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is seen with mild stable interstitial edema.
 Opacification at the left lung base obscuring the hemidiaphragm is suggestive
 of a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, although a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion.
 
 Median sternotomy wires are again noted and right axillary surgical ___
 are seen. An aortic valve replacement is seen.  Compression deformity with
 vertebral plana involving the mid thoracic spine is stable compared to the
 prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe opacification likely secondary to a small pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
