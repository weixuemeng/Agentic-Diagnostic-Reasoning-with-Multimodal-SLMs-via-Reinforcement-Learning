                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, CTA chest
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable view of the chest was reviewed.  Again seen are median
 sternotomy wires as well as a prosthetic aortic valve, in standard positions.
 Significant mitral annular calcifications are again noted. There is mild
 cardiomegaly, stable over the past 10 days.  A left pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis obscures the left heart border.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is seen. Slightly increased and more
 confluent interstitial markings in the right lateral mid lung may be
 indicative of an infectious process. Alternatively, mitral regurgitation may
 result in asymmetric right upper lobe pulmonary edema from aberrant blood flow
 into the right superior pulmonary vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary edema.  More confluent
 consolidation in the right mid lung may represent a developing pneumonia or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema related to mitral regurgitation.
