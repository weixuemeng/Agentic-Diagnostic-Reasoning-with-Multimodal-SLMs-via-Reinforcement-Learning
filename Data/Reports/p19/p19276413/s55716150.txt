                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for PNA, effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart remains enlarged. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has slightly
 worsened.  Opacification at the left base is unchanged and may reflect
 atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. As before
 median sternotomy wires are intact. Surgical clips project in the right
 axilla.  Aortic valve replacement is seen. Again there is compression
 deformity with vertebra plana involving the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiac enlargement and worsening of mild interstitial edema.
 2. Persistent opacity at the left base may reflect atelectasis and pleural
 effusion, however an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
