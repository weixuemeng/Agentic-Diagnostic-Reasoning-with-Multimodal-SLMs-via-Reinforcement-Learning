                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, ___, ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is seen with mild pulmonary edema.  There is
 also opacification at the left lung base obscuring the hemidiaphragm
 concerning for a moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis, but the effusion
 appears decresaed.  An underlying pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.  A small
 right pleural effusion is noted.  Median sternotomy wires are again noted, and
 right axillary surgical ___ are seen.  An aortic valve replacement is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly associated with mild pulmonary edema.  Left lower
 lobe opacification likely represents a moderate pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis, though an underlying consolidation cannot be fully
 excluded.  Left basilar opacification has improved, however.
