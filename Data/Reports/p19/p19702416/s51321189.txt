                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction, inserted via a right subclavian approach.  The heart is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged with a globular configuration.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  The aortopulmonary window is slightly prominent suggesting
 possible enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.  Central pulmonary arteries
 are also mildly enlarged.  There is an asymmetric left paramedian opacity with
 upward tenting, perhaps a form of scarring.  Bilateral perihilar fullness
 suggests mild superimposed pulmonary congestion, however.  A moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion is also noted.  Associated parenchymal opacity is
 suspected, probably attributable to associated atelectasis, although
 infectious etiology is not entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly and prominent
 central pulmonary vascularity and suspected congestion.  Asymmetric left
 perihilar opacification with a relatively straight edge, possibly due to
 scarring and congestion; correlation with prior radiographs is suggested as
 well as clinical history.
