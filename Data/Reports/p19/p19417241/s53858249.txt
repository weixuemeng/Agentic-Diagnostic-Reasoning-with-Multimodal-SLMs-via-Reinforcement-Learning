                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with urosepsis, intubated  // ? interval change -
 placement of ETT   NGT      ? interval change - placement of ETT   NGT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube
 remains in stable position. Orogastric 2 terminates in the stomach.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion persists. The left hemidiaphragm is not well
 seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probably some
 pleural effusion.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, a superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
