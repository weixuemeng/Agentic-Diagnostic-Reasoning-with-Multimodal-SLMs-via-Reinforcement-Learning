                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubated, OG tube  // eval for ETT/OGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:45.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval intubation with the
 endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm from the carina. The orogastric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  There is significant cardiomegaly and
 calcification of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial abnormality, particularly at the right
 lung base, has progressed since the prior chest radiograph.  No strong
 evidence for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Satisfactory positioning of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube, with
 interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion since the prior radiograph,
 but no strong evidence for pneumonia.
