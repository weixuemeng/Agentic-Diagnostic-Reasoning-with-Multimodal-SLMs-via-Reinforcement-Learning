                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. The aortic
 arch is calcified.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated relative to the
 left. Lung parenchyma shows mild interstitial prominence including cuffed
 airways but is otherwise clear without focal opacification.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly prominent interstitium which may indicate airway inflammation or mild
 pulmonary congestion, but no focal opacification to suggest pneumonia.
