                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Severe tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was
 obtained.  There are prominent bilateral predominantly perihilar opacities
 which may be due to severe pulmonary edema/ARDS, possible multifocal
 infection.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles and small pleural
 effusions are not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is likely top normal to
 mildly enlarged, although not well assessed due to right lung base opacities. 
 Aortic knob is calcified.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive perihilar opacities raise concern for severe pulmonary
 edema/ARDS, possible multifocal infection.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles, small pleural effusions not excluded.
