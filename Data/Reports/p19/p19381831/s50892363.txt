                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, dyspnea  // Eval for infiltrate, volume
 overload      Eval for infiltrate, volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___,014 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size has mildly increased compared with the immediate prior study and
 the vasculature is less well-defined suggesting volume overload without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Trace pleural effusions are likely present bilaterally. 
 There is no focal consolidation.  Diffuse sclerosis of the visualized skeleton
 is compatible with known history of metastatic prostate cancer.  There is no
 pneumothorax or displaced pathologic fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Volume overload without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Diffuse sclerotic osseous lesions compatible with metastatic prostate
 cancer.
