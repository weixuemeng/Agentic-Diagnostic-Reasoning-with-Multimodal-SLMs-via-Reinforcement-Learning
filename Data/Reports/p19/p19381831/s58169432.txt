                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD and worsening dyspnea x3 weeks worsening acutely in
 past day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous,
 and the mediastinal and hilar contours are similar compared to the previous
 study.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Paraseptal emphysematous
 changes, most pronounced within the right upper lobe, are also re-
 demonstrated along with lung hyperinflation.  Streaky opacity is noted in the
 right lung base.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Osseous structures remain diffusely sclerotic compatible with known
 metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar streaky opacity, likely atelectasis.  Early infection is not
 completely excluded
