                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe persistent asthma with acute
 exacerbation  // any change in previously noted opacities?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior, there has been improvement of previously seen bilateral
 opacities.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There are residual linear
 opacities in the right mid lung, may represent impacted bronchi or
 atelectasis.  There is no significant pleural effusion.  The heart size is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A small
 sclerotic focus in the left humerus and diffuse sclerotic rib lesions likely
 represent metastatic foci.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of bilateral opacities with residual linear opacities
 in the right middle lobe.
 2. Sclerotic bone lesions, likely metastatic foci.
