 INDICATION:  Patient with three-week history of cough and new-onset fatigue. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Linear
 opacity in the right lung base likely represents atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  There is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 which likely reflects eventration.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
