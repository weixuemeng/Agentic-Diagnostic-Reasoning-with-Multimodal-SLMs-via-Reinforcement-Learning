                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Possible past history of tuberculosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Central venous line tip terminates in the right atrium.  If the tip is
 required to be above the cavoatrial junction, withdrawal of 3 cm is
 recommended.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable within the
 limitations of the study technique and the lungs are clear.  Lateral view
 suggests potential calcified hilar lymph nodes and questionable opacity
 projecting over the aortic arch on the lateral view.  If prior imaging is not
 available for comparison, chest CT might be considered for precise assessment
 of the findings.
