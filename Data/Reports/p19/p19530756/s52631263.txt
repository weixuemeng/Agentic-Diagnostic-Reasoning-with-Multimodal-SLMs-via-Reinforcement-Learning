 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The
 previously noted widening of the superior mediastinal contour has essentially
 resolved, likely due to low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Slight unfolding of thoracic aorta
 without superior mediastinal widening.
