                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally
 with meniscal configuration, concerning for bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 aerated upper lungs demonstrate prominent pulmonary vasculature without
 evidence for edema.  Large hiatal hernia is again seen with adjacent
 compressive atelectasis.  There are increased basilar consolidations, likely
 atelectasis in the setting of effusion.  However, pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The cardiac
 silhouette is obscured and therefore heart size is incompletely evaluated on
 this study.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Right glenohumeral degenerative
 changes noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, new or increased compared to prior,
 without evidence for pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar consolidations most likely
 represent atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 10:50 p.m. on
 ___ at the time of initial review of the study.
