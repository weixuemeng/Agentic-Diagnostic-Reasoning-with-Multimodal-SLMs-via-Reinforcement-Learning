                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dyspnea, shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar,
 right greater than left opacities are again seen, similar compared to the
 prior study from ___.  On CT from ___, there is seen to be a large
 hiatal hernia extending into the right lower hemithorax with adjacent
 atelectasis.  Suggestion of air-fluid level seen in the right lung base likely
 relates to this large hiatal hernia.  Stable medial left base patchy opacity
 most likely relates to atelectasis/scarring.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouette is grossly stable as compared to ___.  Slight blunting of
 posterior costophrenic angle makes a trace pleural effusion difficult to
 exclude.  Evidence of prior vertebroplasty is again seen in the lower thoracic
 spine with a vertebral body just inferior to this compressed appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Right base opacity with air-fluid level likely corresponds
 to known large hiatal hernia seen on prior imaging with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Blunting of posterior costophrenic angle makes trace effusion difficult to
 exclude.
