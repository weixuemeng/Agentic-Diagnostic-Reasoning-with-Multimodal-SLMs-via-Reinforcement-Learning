                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, now with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A consolidation at the right lung base
 with a small pleural effusion is seen and is unchanged dating back to ___.
 Many basilar linear opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The trachea takes an ectatic course, which is unchanged from
 priors and likely due to scoliosis.  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The left
 humeral shoulder is noted again to be chronically dislocated which is
 unchanged going back to ___.  The patient has a severe kyphosis with
 her vertebroplasty material seen in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar hazy opacities are thought to be secondary to compressive
 atelectasis from a large hiatal hernia.  However, aspiration should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Chronically dislocated left shoulder.
