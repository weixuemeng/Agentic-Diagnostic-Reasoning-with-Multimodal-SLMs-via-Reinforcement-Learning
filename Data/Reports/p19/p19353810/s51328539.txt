                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening sob  // fluid overload?     
 fluid overload?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is again essentially complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax.  This is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lung as well as some pleural effusion, with the mediastinum shifted
 to this side.  The opacification in the right hemithorax is consistent with
 pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.
 
 The pulmonary vascularity is difficult to assess, but there does not appear to
 be substantial pulmonary edema.
