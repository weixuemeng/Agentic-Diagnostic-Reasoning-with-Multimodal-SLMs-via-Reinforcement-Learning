                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to patient rotation.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  A large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  The aortic knob
 remains calcified.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left are increased compared to the prior study. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but aspiration or
 infection is not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left humeral head
 remains chronically dislocated.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is noted with evidence of prior vertebroplasty at the thoracolumbar
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, slightly increased
 in size compared to the previous exam.  Large hiatal hernia.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but aspiration or infection
 cannot be excluded.
