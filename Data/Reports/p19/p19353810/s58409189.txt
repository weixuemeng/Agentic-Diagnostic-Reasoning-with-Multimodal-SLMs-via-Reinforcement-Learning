                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Dyspnea for one week.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Right lower lobe opacity is grossly unchanged, is a combination of a moderate
 pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation.  The consolidation could be
 atelectasis but aspiration/pneumonia cannot be excluded.  This is stable from
 ___, but new or markedly increased from ___.  Minimal atelectasis
 in the left lower lobe has improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there
 is a small left pleural effusion.  I suspect the presence of emphysema.  The
 upper lobes are clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is
 hyperkyphosis.  There are several wedge shape deformities in mid-to-low
 thoracic vertebral bodies.  There is a vertebroplasty in one of these
 vertebral bodies.
