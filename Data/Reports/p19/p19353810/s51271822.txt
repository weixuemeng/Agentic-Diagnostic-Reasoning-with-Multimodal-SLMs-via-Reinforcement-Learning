 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The patient's
 kyphotic angulation of the T-spine and rotations of the left limit the
 evaluation.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  A retrocardiac opacity
 could represent a hiatal hernia.  The heart and mediastinal contour appear
 grossly unchanged.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  No acute fracture is
 evident.  Vertebroplasty is present in the lower T-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion.  Probable hiatal hernia. 
 Otherwise, no gross abnormality on this limited exam.
