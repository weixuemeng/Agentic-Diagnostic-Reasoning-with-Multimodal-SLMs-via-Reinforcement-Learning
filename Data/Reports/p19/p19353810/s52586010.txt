                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bad bilateral effusion, dCHF // worsening

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___. ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near complete
 opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward mediastinal shift
 consistent with a massive left pleural effusion and left lung collapse. Stable
 moderate-large right-sided pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Assessment of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not
 possible to assess secondary to large pleural effusion.  Chronic left shoulder
 dislocation and pseudoarthrosis with clavicle again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable near complete opacification of left hemithorax with leftward
 mediastinal shift, consistent with massive left pleural effusion and left lung
 collapse. Stable moderate-large right-sided pleural effusion with compressive
 atelectasis.
