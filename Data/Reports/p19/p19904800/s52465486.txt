 underlying lymphadenopathy.  No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 Bilateral breast implants are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Mediastinal contour appears less

 lymphadenopathy.
