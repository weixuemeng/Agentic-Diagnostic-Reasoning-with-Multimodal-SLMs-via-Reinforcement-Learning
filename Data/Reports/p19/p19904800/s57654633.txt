                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DLBCL, slight cough, fevers
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC, unchanged. Lung
 volumes are lower compared to the previous study which slightly accentuates
 the size of the cardiac silhouette which remains top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.  Bilateral breast prostheses and
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Please note that infection cannot be completely excluded.
