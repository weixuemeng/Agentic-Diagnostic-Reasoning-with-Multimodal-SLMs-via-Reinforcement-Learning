 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with status post CABG, evaluate effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:21.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Persistent small layering left effusion with associated
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Right internal jugular central line
 continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC.  There is improved aeration
 with no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
