                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with new sternal drainage, evaluate for effusion or wire
 break.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 Compared to prior study, median sternotomy wires are unchanged in position and
 orientation.  However, there is a questionable focal break in the seventh
 wire, best appreciated on the lateral view.  There is improvement in the small
 left pleural effusion and associated retrocardiac compressive atelectasis. 
 The right pleural effusion has improved, although there is now linear
 atelectasis in the right juxtahilar region.  No focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Postoperative cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible tiny/focal disruption in the seventh sternotomy wire best
 visualized on lateral view, in retrospect unchanged since ___. If there is
 clinical suspicion for dehiscence or peristernal infection, CT would be
 recommended.
 
 2.  Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac
 atelectasis, but new right juxtahilar linear atelectasis.
