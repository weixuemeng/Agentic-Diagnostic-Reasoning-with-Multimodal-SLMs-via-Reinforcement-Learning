 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Right PICC line tip is at the level
 of mid SVC.  Left chest tube is in place. There is no pneumothorax. Note is
 made of the distended stomach. Minimal bibasal atelectasis are present.
 
 The left chest tube tip appears to be very inferior, most likely in the most
 inferior and medial aspect of the pleura by correlation with lateral view
 would be beneficial. Alternatively pulling of the chest tube might be
 appropriate next step.
