                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Empyema followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 clearing of the empyema with some residual course opacifications at the right
 base posteriorly that could well represent fibrosis.  No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia or vascular congestion at this time.  Left lung is essentially
 clear.
