                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:35 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with a new right chest tube.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New pleural tube projects over the right upper chest.  From single frontal
 view, I cannot tell how much of it is intrathoracic.  It has three acute
 folds, which may be a function or visual foreshortening rathern than real, any
 one of which could be occlusive.  The lower right chest has the appearance of
 an anterior pneumothorax, similarly difficult to assess without a lateral
 view.  The indwelling right pleural drain in the lower chest is unchanged in
 position, with a suggestion that only a short segment of it is intrathoracic. 
 The extent of right pleural thickening or loculated fluid has decreased in the
 upper chest a little since 7:42 a.m. following insertion of the second right
 pleural drain.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Left lung is clear.
