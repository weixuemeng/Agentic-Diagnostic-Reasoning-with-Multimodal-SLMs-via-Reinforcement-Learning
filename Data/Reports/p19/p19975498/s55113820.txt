                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Right lower lung
 consolidation is seen with loculated right pleural effusion/thickening.  While
 this may represent pneumonia, underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded and
 followup to resolution is advised.  The left lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears grossly unremarkable allowing for subtle effacement along
 the right heart border.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation within the right lower lung with subjacent
 loculated pleural fluid/thickening.  Given the absence of prior imaging
 studies, differential is broad and includes infection and neoplasm.  Please
 correlate clinically and with prior imaging studies if available.  Consider CT
 to further assess.
