                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM TO CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___.
 
 ADDENDUM:  An approximately 1-cm diameter nodular opacity overlies the left
 third posterior rib at the left lung apex and appears more conspicuous than on
 prior chest radiograph of ___.  This has been more fully
 characterized on recent CT C-spine from earlier the same date.  Considering
 rapidity of apparent change and the presence of adjacent calcifications on
 prior CT, differential diagnostic considerations include post-primary
 reactivation tuberculosis and a primary lung neoplasm arising adjacent to an
 area of previous granulomatous exposure.  Dr. ___ was contacted by
 phone to discuss this finding at 11:35 a.m. on ___ at the time of
 discovery.

 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 demonstrate nonspecific biapical scarring with nodularity at left apex as well
 as a focal area of linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  No pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings are evident in the chest.
