                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AML, status post stem cell transplant, recent relapse.
 
 CHEST, AP SEMI-ERECT
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___.
 
 The heart appears larger than on the prior occasion, though much of this might
 be due to projection in the semi-erect position.  However, a left effusion
 does appear to be present and a subtle increase in density is seen in both
 bases, particularly on the left.  This may be caused by some failure.  The tip
 of the central line lies at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left effusion and possible failure.
