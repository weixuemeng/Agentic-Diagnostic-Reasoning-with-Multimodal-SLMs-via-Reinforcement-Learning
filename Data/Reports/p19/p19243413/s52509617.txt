 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, overnight fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusions or focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.
