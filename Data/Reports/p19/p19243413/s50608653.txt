                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Positive blood culture.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and pleural fluid.  Some ill-defined opacification at the right base
 could also reflect developing atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
