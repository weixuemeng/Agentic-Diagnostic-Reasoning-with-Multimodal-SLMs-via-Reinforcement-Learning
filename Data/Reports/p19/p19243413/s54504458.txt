                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with AML after allogenic
 stem cell transplantation with neutropenia and increasing bandemia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No focal consolidations
 to suggest infectious process demonstrated except for questionable opacity,
 minimal in the right lower lobe but that might reflect the summation of
 shadows as well.  Attention to this area on the subsequent studies is
 recommended.
