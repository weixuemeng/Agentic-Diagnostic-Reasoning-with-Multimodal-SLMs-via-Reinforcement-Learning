                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute myelocytic leukemia with CNS
 involvement, status post bone marrow transplant, has acute mental status
 changes.  Evaluate for possible acute intrapulmonary infection versus
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained on ___.  Remarkable is that the heart size
 has increased during the latest 24 hours examination interval.  There is no
 typical configurational abnormality, but the finding could be explained by
 increasing circulating blood volume.  The pulmonary vasculature is slightly
 more distended but does not show any evidence of extravasation in the form of
 interstitial or alveolar edema and the lateral pleural sinus remain free.  No
 evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  No
 pneumothorax existing in the apical area.  Remarkable is that the previously
 described right-sided PICC line projects now with its tip into the upper
 portion of the right atrium.  This may be related to the described increase of
 the heart volume unless the PICC line has been advanced inadvertently. 
 Observe that PICC line may cause mechanical arrhythmias if in contact with the
 right atrial wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heart size increased indicating augmented circulating blood
 volume, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Observe
 comments made regarding previously placed PICC line.
