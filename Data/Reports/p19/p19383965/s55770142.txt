                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is continued increase in interstitial markings bilaterally,
 similar to the prior study consistent with multifocal bronchiectasis and
 chronic lung disease.  On the lateral view, there may be slight increase in
 opacity projecting over the lower cervical spine, although this is not
 substantiated on the frontal view, though an infectious process cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chronic changes in the lungs including chronically
 increased interstitial markings and multifocal bronchiectasis, subtle increase
 in opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view,
 appears increased as compared to the prior study though may be related to
 differences in technique in inspiration, however, infectious process is not
 entirely excluded.
