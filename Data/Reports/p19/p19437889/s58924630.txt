                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up opacity described in prior chest x-ray.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated suggesting the presence of COPD.  The hemidiaphragms are
 flattened.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe described in prior study has
 improved consistent with improving atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
