                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with EtOH hepatitis, pneumonia and new hypoxia,
 assess for flash pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung volumes.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the right are new. Difuse lung consolidations, larger on
 the right lung have progressed.  These are more consistent with worsening
 pulmonary edema. infectious process remains possible. Follow up is recommended
