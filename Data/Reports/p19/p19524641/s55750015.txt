                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough for the past 2 weeks.  // Pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of mild
 overinflation. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. However,
 more pronounced than on the previous examination, is a subtle rounded opacity
 of approximately 1.5 cm in diameter at the level of the right lung apex,
 projecting over the posterior aspect of the fourth right rib. To exclude a
 neoplasm, CT is recommended.
 
 Minimal scarring at the level of both the left and the right lung apex.  No
 pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
 
 The findings as well as the recommendation for CT were added to the radiology
 dashboard.
