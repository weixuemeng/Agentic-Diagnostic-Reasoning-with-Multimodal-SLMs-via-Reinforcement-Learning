                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremia and cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  The left costophrenic angle is blunted, which may
 reflect left basilar effusion versus atelectasis, although infection cannot be
 excluded.  No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Left CPA blunting may reflect atelectasis versus small pleural
 effusion.  Findings may also reflect infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
