                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pre-operatively prior to hip reduction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with coarse interstitial markings,
 likely representing COPD.  There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles likely from small bilateral pleural effusions.  A retrocardiac opacity
 is likely atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is massively enlarged, and
 unchanged.  Clips in the left axilla are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic changes of COPD.
 2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
 3.  Severe stable cardiomegaly.
