                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen with secondary
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are
 most likely due to atelectasis.  Lateral view is limited secondary to motion
 but there is no evidence of effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and is
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the
 aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
