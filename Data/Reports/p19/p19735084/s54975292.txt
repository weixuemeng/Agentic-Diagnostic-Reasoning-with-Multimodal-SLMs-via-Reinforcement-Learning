 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer history with right Pleurx
 catheter, dyspnea, assess for worsening collection versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  The chest tube
 projects over the right lateral hemithorax with lateralizing right pleural
 effusion again seen.  There is right perihilar opacity which appears similar
 to the prior exam allowing for slight changes in patient positioning.  The
 left lung is mostly clear, though there may be mild atelectasis at the left
 lung base.  The heart size is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change given slight differences in technique.
