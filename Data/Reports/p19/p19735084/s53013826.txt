                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with acute change in mental status. History of
 metastatic lung cancer. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available (patient is listed as EU Critical).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ill-defined opacity is seen in the right perihilar region, with
 associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and a small right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Right basilar patchy opacity is identified.  Otherwise, the
 left lung is well expanded without focal opacities.  There is no left-sided
 pleural effusion. Cardiac size is normal. Thickening of the right paratracheal
 stripe likely indicates mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right perihilar opacity likely reflects known malignancy, with
 small right pleural effusion. Right basilar patchy opacity could reflect
 atelectasis or infection. Widened right paratracheal stripe suggests
 lymphadenopathy. Comparison with prior imaging exams are recommended to assess
 for interval change.
