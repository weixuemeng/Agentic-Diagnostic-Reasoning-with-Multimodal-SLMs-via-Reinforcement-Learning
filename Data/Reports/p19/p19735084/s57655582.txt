                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right-sided chest and shoulder pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Linear
 atelectasis is seen in the right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure with
 volume loss.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and left hilar
 contours are normal. The right hilum is slightly enlarged. No acute osseous
 abnormality or displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe atelectasis with volume loss. This is due to a
 right hilar lesion, better assessed on the subsequent CT.
