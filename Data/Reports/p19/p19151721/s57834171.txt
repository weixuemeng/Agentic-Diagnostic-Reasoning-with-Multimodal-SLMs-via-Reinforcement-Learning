                                 FINAL REPORT
 A PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple lower extremity
 revascularization, now with likely thrombosed graft and new cough.  Pre-op.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  Right PICC line has been removed.  Although
 the interstitium remains slightly prominent, no focal airspace consolidation
 is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is possible blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, raising the possibility of pleural thickening versus a
 small effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
