                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endocarditis, to assess effusion and edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with low lung volumes.  Some
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification with obliteration of the
 costophrenic angle on this side is consistent with volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this
 could well be a manifestation of pneumonia.
