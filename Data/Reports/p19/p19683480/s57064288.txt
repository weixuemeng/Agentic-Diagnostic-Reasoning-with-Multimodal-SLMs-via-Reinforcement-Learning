 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe effusion, gastric distention, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in extent of the known left pleural effusion.  As a consequence, the
 retrocardiac atelectasis has also increased.
 
 Newly appeared atelectatic changes at the right lung base, likely caused by an
 overall decrease in lung volumes.  However, developing pneumonia should be
 excluded by repeat image.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
