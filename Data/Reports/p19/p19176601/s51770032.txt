                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever, tachycardia and altered mental
 status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided.  Lungs are well
 expanded.  They appear hyperlucent with increased reticulation, likely
 representing emphysema.  No large focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacities are incompletely evaluated and may be
 normal but difficult to evaluate on this single projection.  There are
 calcifications of the aorta.  The bones are osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with emphysema.  Retrocardiac opacities may
 be normal, but is difficult to evaluate on this single projection. If there is
 clinical concern for pneumonia, a lateral projection may be helpful.
