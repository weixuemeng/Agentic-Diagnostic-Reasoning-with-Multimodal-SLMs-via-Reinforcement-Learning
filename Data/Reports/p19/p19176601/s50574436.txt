                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with relative paucity of vasculature
 in the upper lobes suggestive of bullous emphysematous changes.  There is
 crowding of the vasculature in both lower lobes.  A more focal patchy opacity
 at the left base likely represents superimposed vessels and costochondral
 calcifications rather than early airspace consolidation.  However, if the
 patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging would be advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Calcification of the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  No pneumothorax.
