                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Vascular dementia and sepsis, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph shows interstitial consolidation
 at the right lung base, partially obscuring the hemidiaphragm, which is
 increased compared to yesterday's study and similar to that seen in ___ (though this is not the patient's baseline as there are interim films
 that show a clear right lung base).  There may be similar, fainter
 consolidation in the left retrocardiac region.  Upper lobes are clear and
 there is no central pulmonary vascular congestion or cardiomegaly.  There is
 calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the arch of the aorta.  Right IJ central
 venous catheter tip remains at the level of the distal superior vena cava.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Question developing pneumonia at the right lung base.  When the
 patient is clinically able, PA and lateral views may be informative.
