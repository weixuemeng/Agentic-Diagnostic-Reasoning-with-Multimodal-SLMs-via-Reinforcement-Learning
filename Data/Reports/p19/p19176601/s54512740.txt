                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Man with altered mental status.  Concern for pneumonia.  Assess
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged exam.  As
 before there is mild hyperinflation with relative hyperlucency of the
 bilateral upper lungs and paucity of vessels suggesting underlying emphysema. 
 Stable retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis though cannot
 exclude infection in the correct clinical setting.  Dense atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted within the aortic arch.  Prominence of the right
 pulmonary artery suggests a degree of pulmonsry arterial hypertension.  Heart
 size is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged exam.  Stable retrocardiac opacification, most likely
 atelectasis though pneumonia not definitively excluded.  Findings suggestive
 of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
