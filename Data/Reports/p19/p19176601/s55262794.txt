                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aortic knob is densely
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with bilateral hilar
 enlargement suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with paucity of pulmonary vascular markings towards the upper
 lobes compatible with severe emphysema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen, although the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field
 of view.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe emphysema.  Enlarged hila bilaterally suggestive of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
 
 
 ADDENDUM:  Note is made of a right-sided PICC, ending in the mid SVC.  This
 finding was communicated to IV nurse, ___, by Dr. ___ at
 1:50 a.m. via telephone on ___.
