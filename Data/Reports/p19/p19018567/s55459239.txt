                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with severe pain, history of multiple myeloma.
 Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with attenuation of the peripheral vessels,
 compatible with emphysema.  In the periphery of the right mid lung, projecting
 over the anterior right fourth rib there is a vague opacity, which may
 represent pulmonary consolidation versus summation of structures. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Multiple small lucent lesions in the right clavicle and scapula
 are compatible with known history of multiple myeloma. There is less than ___%
 compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Vague opacity in the periphery of the right lung mass described above. 
 Pulmonary consolidation cannot be excluded. Further assessment with chest CT
 is recommended.
 
 2.  Compression deformity of a midthoracic vertebral body of unknown
 chronicity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 9:28 AM, immediately after discussion with the
 attending radiologist.
