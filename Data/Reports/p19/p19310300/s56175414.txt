                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is improved.  Opacity at the left lung base this likely
 unchanged, and likely represents atelectasis, although superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Opacity at the left lung base is likely unchanged and may represent
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
