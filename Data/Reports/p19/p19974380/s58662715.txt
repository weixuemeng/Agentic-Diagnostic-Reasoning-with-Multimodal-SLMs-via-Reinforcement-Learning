                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 3:40 A.M.  ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, check ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube is at the upper margin of the aortic knob, no less than 4.5 cm above
 the carina with the chin down.  This could be advanced ___ ___ cm for more
 secure seating.
 
 Dense opacification in the left lower lobe is probably atelectasis, worsened
 since ___ but not appreciably changed since ___.  Right
 hemidiaphragm is persistently elevated, but discrete atelectasis at the right
 lung base has actually improved.  The upper lung is clear.  Mild perihilar
 opacification around the left hilus could be mild edema or recent aspiration,
 warrants follow up.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  
 
 An intended right internal jugular line followed a course on ___ more
 typical of the superior vena cava.  Today, it appears left of midline,
 although this could be a function of leftward mediastinal shift. 
 Nevertheless, it should be assessed clinically to make sure it is not
 intra-arterial, since unbenounced to me it could have been reinserted.  If
 this is the same line that was present on ___ at 11:45 a.m., when a  CT
 confirmed that it was in the superior vena cava, then no additional
 confirmation is needed.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with the house officer caring for this
 position at the time of dictation.
