 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Laminectomy at the lumbar spine.  Evaluation for changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 Lung volumes have minimally decreased, likely caused by a lesser inspiratory
 maneuver.  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta,
 but no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia, no
 pneumothorax.
