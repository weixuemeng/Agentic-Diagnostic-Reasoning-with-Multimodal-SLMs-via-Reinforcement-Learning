                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left PICC line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Correlation made to CT torso dated ___.

 appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are clear.  The
 heart is normal size. There is new slight thickening of the left paratracheal
 stripe at the level of mild lower thoracic spine angular kyphosis where a mild
 T8 compression fracture was identified on recent CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New slight thickening of the left paravertebral stripe at the level of a
 previously identified mild T8 vertebral body compression deformity raises
 concern for increasing paravertebral hematoma. Dedicated cross-sectional
 imaging is advised.
 
 Lines and tubes in appropriate position. Clear lungs.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
