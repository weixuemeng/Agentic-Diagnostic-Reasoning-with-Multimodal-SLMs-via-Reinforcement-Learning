                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  PEs.  Confirm position of Dobbhoff.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single chest x-ray was obtained.

 Right-sided PICC line is in good position.  Dobbhoff catheter is coiled in the
 proximal stomach pointing back towards the cardia.  The lungs show some patchy
 opacities at both bases, perhaps more pronounced on the left side.  Oral
 contrast is identified within the ascending colon.

 Dobbhoff is coiled in the stomach and retracted backwards.  Further
 advancement could be used.
