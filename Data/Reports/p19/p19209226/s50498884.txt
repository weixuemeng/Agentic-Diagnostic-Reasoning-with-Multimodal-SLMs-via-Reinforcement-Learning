                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest wall pain at the most inferior ribs.  Evaluate for
 a rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___ and same
 day CT abdomen pelvis.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest were performed (3 exposures).  Streaky
 opacification in the lung bases is thought to represent atelectasis as seen on
 the same day CT.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal
 in size.  There is a hiatal hernia.  The mediastinal contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  Retained enteric contrast is seen within the imaged
 upper abdomen.  There is a left nondisplaced rib fracture.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  There is a left non-displaced
 rib fracture.
