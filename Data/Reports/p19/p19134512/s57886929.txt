                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacity within the lung bases
 likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  There is mild blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic angles, left greater than right, findings consistent with small
 effusions or pleural thickening. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  A prosthetic
 cardiac valve is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No edema or confluent
 consolidation.
