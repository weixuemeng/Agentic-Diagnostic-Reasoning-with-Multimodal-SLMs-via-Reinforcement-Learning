                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of productive cough and
 fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right
 infrahilar opacity seen on the frontal view is not well seen in the lateral
 view, but raises concern for medial right lower lobe consolidation. 
 Alternatively, this could be an area of atelectasis.  The left lung is clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is a likely 4 mm calcified granuloma
 projecting over the right upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Medial right base/infrahilar opacity seen on the frontal view
 raising concern for consolidation due to infection.
