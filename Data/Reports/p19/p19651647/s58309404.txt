                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Patient with atrial fibrillation and desaturation
 after surgery.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest is compared to ___.
 
 There is substantial interval improvement in pulmonary edema with only minimal
 vascular and interstitial congestion currently seen.  There is a substantial
 amount of intraperitoneal air that might be consistent with ileus/bowel
 obstruction, please correlate clinically.  There is no pleural effusion and
 there is no pneumothorax.
 
 The asymmetry between right and left lung might be consistent with right upper
 lobe pneumonia or potentially sequela of resolving edema.
