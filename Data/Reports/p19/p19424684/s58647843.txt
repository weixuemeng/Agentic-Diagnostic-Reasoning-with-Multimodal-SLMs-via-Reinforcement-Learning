 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with failure to thrive  // Eval for infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly to severely enlarged, however this is likely
 accentuated by a large hiatal hernia with air-fluid level seen on the lateral
 view.  The posterior chest is partially obscured by external artifact on the
 lateral view.  Given this, no large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large hiatal hernia.  Large cardiac silhouette, may be exaggerated by large
 hiatal hernia.
