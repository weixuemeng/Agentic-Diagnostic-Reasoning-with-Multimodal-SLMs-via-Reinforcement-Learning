                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lightheadedness and hypotension  // etiology of
 infection?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly suggests
 the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild to moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Clips from prior
 cholecystectomy are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis, with probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
