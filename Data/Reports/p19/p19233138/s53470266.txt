                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of pulmonary hypertension,
 hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presents with cough x 2 weeks, dyspnea, now with
 hypoxia, right crackles on exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is similar compared to the previous study with
 dense mitral annular calcifications as well as evidence of prior coronary
 artery stenting.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mild
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated along with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 all of which have progressed since the previous chest radiograph.  Patchy
 opacities are seen in the lung bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  Multiple clips are noted within the left upper
 abdomen.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, progressed from
 the previous examination.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis, however infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.
