                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough for last week.  PCP reported he had
 pneumonia on outside chest x-ray.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is subtle
 increased opacity identified in the right mid lung and at the right base
 laterally, which could represent focal regions of consolidation.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs appear grossly clear.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Mitral annular
 calcifications are seen.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the
 aorta, which is tortuous.  Surgical clips identified in the upper abdomen. 
 Soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable, as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased parenchymal opacity in the right lung,
 potentially representing pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Repeat
 exam recommended after treatment to document resolution.
