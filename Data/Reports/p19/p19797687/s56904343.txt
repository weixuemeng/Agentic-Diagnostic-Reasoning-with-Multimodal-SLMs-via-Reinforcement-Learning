                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, multiple myeloma and shortness of breath, cough. Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs with
 flattening of the diaphragms and basilar predominance.Persistent left upper
 lobe opacity may represent a component of overlapping shadows however cannot
 exclude pulmonary nodule. Areas of bronchial wall thickening and
 bronchiectasis are similar to previous examination. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Hyperinflated lungs with basilar predominance is most consistent with
 emphysema and areas of air trapping in the lower lobes however differential
 includes also 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
 2.  Persistent left upper lobe opacity may represent overlapping shadows
 however cannot exclude pulmonary nodule. Recommend shallow oblique views for
 further evaluation.
 3.  Areas of bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis, similar to previous
 examination can be seen with small airway disease and/or bronchitis in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 4.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 10:20 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
