                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with PICC dysfunction, known empyema  // Eval pleural
 effusion/empyema, eval PICC
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent right basilar opacity which is somewhat improved when
 compared to the most recent x-ray.  Linear bibasilar opacities may be due to a
 combination of atelectasis or scarring.  There is no large pleural effusion
 although blunting of the right lateral and posterior costophrenic angles could
 represent small residual effusion, potentially in part loculated laterally. 
 Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis medially is also less conspicuous. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Left PICC is seen with tip in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right basilar opacity although improved since ___.  This is
 likely due to known underlying pulmonary abscess/consolidation.  Suspected
 residual small effusion on the right as well as left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Left PICC tip projects over the upper right atrium.
