 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of chest radiograph and CT of ___, there is
 little overall change.  Irregular areas of opacification are again seen in the
 left mid to lower lung along with extensive changes of emphysema.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle has developed along with some basilar
 opacification.  Although this could well represent merely atelectasis, in the
 appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
