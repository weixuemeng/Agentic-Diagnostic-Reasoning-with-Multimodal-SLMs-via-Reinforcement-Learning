                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with myeloma and COPD, worsened cough,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size remains normal.  The same holds for
 the thoracic aorta.  No mediastinal abnormalities are present.  Similar as on
 the preceding examination, low positioned and flattened diaphragms coincide
 with emphysematic translucency of the lung bases.  Pulmonary vasculature with
 central prominence and peripheral attenuation typical for rather advanced
 COPD.  Comparison with the next preceding study does not establish any new
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate that might represent an overlying acute
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with advanced COPD, but no new acute
 infiltrate identified.
