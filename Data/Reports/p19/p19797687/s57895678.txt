                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with myeloma, now with new lateral
 chest pain, bilateral lower extremity edema, will receive VQ scan to evaluate
 for pulmonary embolism.  Any abnormality?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 single view chest examination of ___.  Heart size remains
 normal.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Ordinary ___ of
 thoracic aorta with a few calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the
 arch.  No mediastinal abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 characterized by absence of any congestion, but rather irregular vascular
 distribution with changing individual vessel diameters and areas of increased
 translucency.  These happened to be most prominent in the lower lobe areas and
 coincide with rather low positioned diaphragms which appear flattened.  There
 is no evidence of pleural effusion in either lateral or posterior pleural
 sinuses.  Acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified;
 however, there exists a few scattered small diameter rounded densities, one of
 which is located in the right lower lobe in supradiaphragmatic position and
 appears unchanged.
 
 Skeletal structures of the thorax are characterized by a mild degree of
 S-shaped scoliosis in the thoracolumbar spine and moderately diffuse
 demineralization of the thoracic spine with moderately accentuated kyphotic
 curvature.  There is no evidence of new rib abnormalities as can be identified
 on these standard PA and lateral chest views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiac enlargement or pulmonary congestion, rather typical
 findings of chronic pulmonary obstructive airway disease with basal emphysema
 but no acute parenchymal infiltrates.
