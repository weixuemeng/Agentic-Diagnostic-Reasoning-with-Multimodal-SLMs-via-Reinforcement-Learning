 fissure.  A left pleural effusion has nearly resolved in the interval. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Left lower lobe consolidation has

 Worsening right middle and lower lobe opacities may reflect atelectasis
 associated with the enlarging right effusion but coexisting pneumonia is also
 possible.

 pneumothorax with associated enlargement of right pleural effusion since ___.
