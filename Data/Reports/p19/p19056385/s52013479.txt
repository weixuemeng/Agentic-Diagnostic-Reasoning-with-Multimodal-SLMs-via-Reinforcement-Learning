                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall approx ___ ft onto chest  // fall ___ft off
 ladder onto chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes which likely in part accentuate the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is mild prominence of the superior
 mediastinum, most likely related to low lung volumes, and AP, portable view. 
 However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, chest CT
 is more sensitive.  The lungs are grossly clear.  No focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild prominence of the superior mediastinum most likely
 related to low lung volumes, and AP, portable view.  However, there is high
 clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, chest CT is more sensitive.
 
 No focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax seen.
