                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 21:42.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm above the level of the carina.  The
 tunneled right-sided catheter is unchanged in position. Slightly improved lung
 volumes allow better visualization of unchanged bibasilar atelectasis. Small
 pleural effusions are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.  Otherwise, no significant change.
