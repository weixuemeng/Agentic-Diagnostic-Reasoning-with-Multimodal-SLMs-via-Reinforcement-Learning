                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of aspiration events, renal failure,
 assess all the tubes and lines.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study ___.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Large right
 supraclavicular catheter tip is in the right atrium as before.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is normal.  Large bilateral effusion has probably
 decreased on the left.  Component of vascular congestion has improved. 
 Multifocal lung consolidations consistent with multifocal pneumonia are
 grossly unchanged, still larger in the left upper lobe.
