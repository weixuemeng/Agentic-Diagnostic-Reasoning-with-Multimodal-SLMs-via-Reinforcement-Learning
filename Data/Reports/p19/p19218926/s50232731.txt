                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after extubation for
 aspiration pneumonia, now with NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 on ___.
 
 The right NG tube tip is at the level of the proximal stomach and should be
 further advanced.  Large bilateral pleural effusions, most likely shifted but
 not increased in size since the prior study are redemonstrated as well as left
 and right central venous lines.
