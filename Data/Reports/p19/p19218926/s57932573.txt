                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian venous catheter has been placed, since the prior
 study, which terminates in the right atrium.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is again mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  On this study, there is a new substantial but plate-like
 opacity in the right mid lung, which is highly suggestive of atelectasis; an
 infectious cause seems unlikely to explain this appearance.  The left lung is
 clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post interval placement of dialysis catheter.  Focal right
 lung opacity, suggestive of atelectasis; short-term follow-up radiographs may
 be helpful.
