                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left pleural effusion, question recurrence.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has recurred and atelectasis is
 presumably responsible for signs of consolidation in the infrahilar left lower
 lobe.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart is normal size, but slightly larger
 than before.  Very heavy central granulomatous calcification is noted.
