                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the upper SVC.  Left
 lower extremity thorax opacity is similar to slightly increased, all likely
 representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Aside from
 minimal right base atelectasis, the right lung is clear.  There is no
 right-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
