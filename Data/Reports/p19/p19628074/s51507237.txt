 COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is a
 left subclavian port with tip terminating in the mid SVC. Low lung volumes may
 be accounted for by ascites. There is new plate-like atelectasis at the right
 mid-to-lower lung zone.  There is a new moderately-sized left pleural effusion
 with atelectasis.
