                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with COPD, now with two days of worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears unchanged compared
 to prior.  There is increased density at the left costophrenic angle, which
 may represent pleural effusion.  The lungs are hyperinflated with underlying
 emphysematous changes.  Linear opacity in the left mid-lung likely represents
 atelectasis.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with a densely
 calcified aorta.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Mitral annular calcification
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may
 represent effusion or atelectasis.
