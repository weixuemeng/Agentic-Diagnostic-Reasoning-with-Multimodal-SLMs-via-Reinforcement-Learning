                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There are patchy opacifications in
 the right lung field, which may represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is cephalization of vessels,
 suggestive of pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart is
 top normal in size.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacifications within the right lung field may represent asymmetrical
 pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection is not excluded.  There is
 cephalization of vessels and small bilateral pleural effusions, suggestive of
 pulmonary edema.
