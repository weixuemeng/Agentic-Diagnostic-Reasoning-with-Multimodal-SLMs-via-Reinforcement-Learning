                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with vomiting and nausea
 and right middle lobe abnormalities.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 There is right middle lobe linear opacity, most likely reflecting
 consolidation that potentially might be either infectious or less likely
 aspiration in origin.  Rest of the lungs is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy
 is recommended.
