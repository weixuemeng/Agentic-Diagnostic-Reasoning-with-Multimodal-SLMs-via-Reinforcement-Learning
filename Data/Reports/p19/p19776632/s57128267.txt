 mediastinal shift, this is probably due to worsening right lower lobe
 pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear of focal abnormality. Heart size
 top-normal has increased slightly, and pulmonary vasculature is more dilated
 but there is no pulmonary edema.  ET tube tip is between 2 and 3 cm above
 carinal with the chin elevated and should be withdrawn 15 mm for optimal
 placement.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in nondistended stomach.
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
