                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post tracheostomy, evaluate for
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:26.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 4:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the endotracheal tube with placement of a tracheostomy
 which has its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the carina. 
 A left internal jugular central line and a right PICC line are in unchanged
 position.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach.  The heart remains
 enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot
 be excluded.  Lung volumes are markedly diminished and there are likely
 layering bilateral effusions and diffuse airspace process which more likely
 represents moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia
 should also be in the differential.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
