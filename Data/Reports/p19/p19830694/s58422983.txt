 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimally improved ventilation of the right lung but relatively
 substantial pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, right more than left,
 persist.  Also, persistent is moderate cardiomegaly.  The lung volumes remain
 low.  The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
