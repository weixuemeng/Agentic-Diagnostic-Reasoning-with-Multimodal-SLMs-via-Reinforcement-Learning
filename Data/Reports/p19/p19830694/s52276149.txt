                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and limit
 assessment for cardiovascular status of the patient.  With these limitations
 in mind, there has been apparent worsening of diffuse pulmonary edema,
 accompanied by moderate-to-large layering effusions.  Suspected anasarca and
 ascites.
