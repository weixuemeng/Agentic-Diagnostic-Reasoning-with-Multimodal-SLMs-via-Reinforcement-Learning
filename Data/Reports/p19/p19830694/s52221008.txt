                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier tonight.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sepsis with placement of a left EJ central venous catheter,
 assess line position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest provided.  Tracheostomy tube,
 right upper extremity PICC line and NG tubes are again seen.  The NG tube
 appears to descend into the left upper abdomen, though the tip is poorly
 visualized.  There is a new left IJ central venous catheter with its tip at
 the expected level of the left brachiocephalic vein.  There is increasing
 opacity within both lungs, though this could, in part, reflect underpenetrated
 technique.  The heart remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left external jugular catheter tip in the region of the left
 brachiocephalic vein.
 2.  Increasing pulmonary airspace opacity likely represents worsening edema.
