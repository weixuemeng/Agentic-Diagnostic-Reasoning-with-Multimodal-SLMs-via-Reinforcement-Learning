                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with histoplasmosis, open abdominal wound
 status post trache, rule out pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study from ___ at 5:23.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 4:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular central line
 remain in place.  Lung volumes remain low with a bilateral airspace process
 which appears to have worsened since the prior study given differences in
 technique between the images.  Findings would favor worsening pulmonary edema
 rather than pneumonia, but clinical correlation would be advised.  Likely
 small bilateral layering effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
