                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pneumothorax after subclavian central line placement.

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left subclavian central line ends in the upper SVC.  A left
 pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.  There is no residual pneumothorax.
 Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are different in distribution due to
 patient positioning, but there has been no appreciable change in size.  The
 mild pulmonary edema has improved.  There is no new consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
