  The endotracheal tube is approximately 5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
  courses below the diaphragm with the tip below the field of view.  There is a
  subtle opacity adjacent to the right heart border which is more conspicuous
  than on the prior exam, and may represent aspiration or a developing
  pneumonia.  Attention on followup exams is recommended.  No other opacity is
  identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
