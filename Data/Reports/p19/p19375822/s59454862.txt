                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with pancreatitis, status post intubation
 for tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 the same day at 8:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new endotracheal tube with the tip in mid trachea,
 approximately 4.4 cm from the carina.  Subclavian PICC line is again
 visualized, but the tip is at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and
 superior vena cava.
 
 Again visualized is a moderate layering left pleural effusion as well as a
 small right pleural effusion.  Left basilar atelectasis appears unchanged. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of new consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position.  Otherwise, little
 change in comparison to prior study from earlier today.
