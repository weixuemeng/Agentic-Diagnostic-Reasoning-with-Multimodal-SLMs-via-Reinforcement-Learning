                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, history of esophageal
 cancer.  Rule out acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 Again seen is right lower lobe opacity medially.  Although somewhat improved
 from prior, there has been no intervening x-ray documenting resolution.  This
 could be due to scarring, post-treatment changes; however, superimposed
 infection is not excluded.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 significant pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Vertically oriented surgical chain sutures again noted.  Right chest wall port
 is no longer seen.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  The
 patient is status post gastric pull-up. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right basilar, medial opacity, potentially due to
 scarring, post-treatment in nature; however, given acute symptoms superimposed
 infection is not excluded.
