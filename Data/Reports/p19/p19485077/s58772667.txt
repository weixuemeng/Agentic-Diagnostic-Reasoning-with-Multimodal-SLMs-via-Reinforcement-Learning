                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p mvc.  Assess for traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated.  There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.  Limited assessment of the osseous structures is notable for
 mild leftward curvature of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Mild leftward curvature of thoracic spine may be positional however is
 suspicious for scoliosis.
 
 3.   Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not
 appropriate for detection or characterization of chest cage lesions. Any focal
 findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or
 CT scanning (performed subsequently).
