                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with alcohol intoxication, coughing with
 scattered rhonchi.  Evaluate for aspiration or an infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is indistinctness of
 the right paratracheal stripe.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Indistinctness of the right paratracheal stripe most likely due
 to technique and patient position but tracheitis cannot be excluded.
