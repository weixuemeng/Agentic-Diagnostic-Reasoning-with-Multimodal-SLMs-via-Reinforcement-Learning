                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with seizures status post central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Films from earlier the same day at 5:34 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is again seen with tip approximately 4 cm from
 the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view.  Interval
 placement of right IJ central venous catheter is seen with tip in the mid SVC.
 There is no visualized pneumothorax based on this portable film.  There is,
 however, new right basilar opacity, which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No displaced fracture
 is identified.  Contour abnormality of the proximal left humerus is again
 noted and not fully assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ line without visualized pneumothorax.  Right basilar
 opacity may represent a combination of a layering effusion and/or atelectasis.
