                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, hydronephrosis of the left kidney, fevers and
 previous colon surgery.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged as are the mediastinal and hilar contours. 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base could reflect resolving infection and/or
 infarction.  A small right pleural effusion appears similar.  Linear opacities
 in the left lung base likely reflect atelectasis.  No pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is seen, and there is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of
 both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent patchy opacity in the right lower lobe which could reflect residual
 infection or infarction.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion. Subsegmental
 atelectasis in the left lung base.
