  Bibasilar opacities could represent areas of multifocal infection. Bilateral
  hilar opacities as well as diffuse interstitial prominence is consistent with
  mild to moderate pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
  identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with DM, ?CAD, COPD, h/o CVA, bioprosthetic MVR in ___,
 recent pna, and being treated for pna at OSH who was transferred from ___
 for evaluation and management of dyspnea.  // eval for pna, interstial lung
 disease, volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The overall radiodensity of the lung parenchyma is
 increased, showing mid and upper lobe predominant areas of ground-glass like
 opacities with air bronchograms. These could reflect the clinically known
 areas of pneumonia.  In addition, however, bilateral areas of platelike
 atelectasis are visualized.  The hilar structures are bilaterally enlarged.
 There is moderate cardiomegaly. Signs of basal apical blood flow
 redistribution are noted.  No pleural effusions.
 
 Overall, the findings are highly suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and
 moderate pulmonary edema.
