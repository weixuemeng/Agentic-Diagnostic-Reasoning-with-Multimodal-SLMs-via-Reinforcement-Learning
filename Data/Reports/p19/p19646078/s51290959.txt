 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, s/p mitral valve replacement ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP upright and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valve again noted.  There is
 interval increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate to large in size. 
 Associated with this is right basal compressive atelectasis, difficult to
 exclude aspiration or pneumonia.  A left mid lung opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  There is probable mild edema. 
 Mediastinal contour remains prominent.  No definite pneumothorax.  No large
 left effusion.  Bony structures are intact.

 As above.
