                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, assess for infection or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison, but reference
 made to outside hospital CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
 overlying right basilar atelectasis.  Relative rounded opacity projecting over
 the right lateral lung base measuring 6-7 mm is not present on the CT from
 ___ and therefore is unlikely to represent a true pulmonary nodule and
 may be artifactual with the adjacent atelectasis.  While the right base
 findings likely represent atelectasis, early infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There is worsening anterior compression of a vertebral body at
 the thoracolumbar junction, which appears worsened as compared to ___. 
 There are also several prominent air-distended loops of bowel.  Correlate
 clinically.
 
 The above findings were discussed with a nurse ___, ___,
 taking care of the patient at 9:13 a.m. on ___, five minutes after
 discovery.
