 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm, tip not visualized. 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged. Mild
 cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. There is slightly increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion, and new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 which is most likely due to atelectasis. A tiny left apical pneumothorax shows
 no appreciable change.  The patient has had previous cervical spine fusion.

 New left lower lobe atelectasis.
 Slightly increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Stable tiny left apical pneumothorax.
