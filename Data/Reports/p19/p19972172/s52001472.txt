                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p drainage of left pleural effusion  // Please
 rule out pneumothorax and evaluate interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the previous radiograph performed earlier the same date, left pleural
 effusion has substantially decreased in size following thoracentesis
 procedure, with development of a small left apical pneumothorax and near
 resolution of the pleural effusion with associated improved aeration of the
 left lung base.  Right pleural effusion is unchanged.
