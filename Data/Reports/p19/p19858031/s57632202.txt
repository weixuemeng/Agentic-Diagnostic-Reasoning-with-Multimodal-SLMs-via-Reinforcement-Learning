 tortuous intrathoracic aorta.  The heart is borderline enlarged in size,
 unchanged since the prior study.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 There is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air.  No pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
