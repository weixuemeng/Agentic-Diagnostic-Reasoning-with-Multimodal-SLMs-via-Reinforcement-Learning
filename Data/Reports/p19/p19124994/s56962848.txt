                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right subclavian vascular catheter remains in standard position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lungs and pleural
 surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with no conventional
 radiographic findings to suggest metastatic disease.  If there is strong
 clinical suspicion for intrathoracic metastatic disease, CT may be considered
 if warranted clinically.
