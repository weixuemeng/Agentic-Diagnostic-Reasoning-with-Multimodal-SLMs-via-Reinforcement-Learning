                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen with leads unchanged in position, currently in
 expected positions of the right atrium and ventricle.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged, with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged.  There
 is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely due to pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Evidence of bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques is again seen.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
