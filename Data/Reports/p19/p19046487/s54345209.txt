                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with rales in the right lung, question
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show new bilateral mild interstitial and focal
 airspace opacities.  Calcified pleural plaques are noted, unchanged.  A more
 confluent opacity in the left lower lobe is associated with a moderate
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 unrermarkable for age.  The hilar contours are prominent.  A left-sided pacer
 terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Sternal
 wires are intact and changes secondary to a CABG are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia with associated effusion.
