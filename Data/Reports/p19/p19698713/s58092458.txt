                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST AT 10:12 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with breast carcinoma and metastases to the
 spine after spinal surgery, now with tachypnea and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Disparity in radiopacity on both sides of the chest is due to a
 moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vasculature is generally
 engorged and the mediastinum is widened suggesting biventricular cardiac
 decompensation.  Greater opacification at the left lung base medially is
 probably due to substantial atelectasis.  Heart size borderline enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
