                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:44 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Traumatic brain injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The patient has been extubated, and lung volumes are slightly lower,
 suggesting some of the increased opacity at the right lung bases due to
 atelectasis.  Upper lungs are grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Most of multiple bilateral rib fractures, the
 preponderance in the left hemithorax, are chronic and healed.  An acute
 fracture could be present and difficult to recognize.  There is no pulmonary
 contusion or hemothorax, or pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged and the
 azygos vein is severely distended suggesting volume overload, although there
 is no pulmonary edema.
