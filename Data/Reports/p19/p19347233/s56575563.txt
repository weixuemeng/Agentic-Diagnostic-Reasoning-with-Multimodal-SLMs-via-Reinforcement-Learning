                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right-sided chest pain.  Rule out
 pneumothorax, mass, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is some
 translucency of the lung bases as before, which is suggestive of COPD or
 emphysema.  The lungs are clear bilaterally, with no evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Multiple osteophytes of the thoracic vertebrae are again seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
