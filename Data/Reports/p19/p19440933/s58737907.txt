                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Sudden-onset abdominal pain, epigastric tenderness. 
 Evaluate for free air under the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and  lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 However, given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vascular
 structures likely relates to low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of free
 air beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragm.  No focal
 consolidation.
