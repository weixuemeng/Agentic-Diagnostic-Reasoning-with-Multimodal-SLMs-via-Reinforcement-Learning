                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cerebral palsy and epilepsy, now with low-grade fever.  Evaluate
 for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Hyperlucency at the right lung base with elevation of the minor
 fissure and depression of the right hemidiaphragm are consistent with right
 lower lobe hyperinflation, possibly secondary to congenital lobar emphysema. 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes are noted
 at the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with right lower lobe hyperinflation, possibly
 secondary to congenital lobar emphysema or a different process causing air
 trapping.  Recommend further evaluation with non-emergent CT.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 1:29
 p.m. on the day of the study.
