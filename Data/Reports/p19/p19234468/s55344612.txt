                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased seizure frequency.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from
 outside hospital from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Faint increased opacity is noted at the right lower lobe and likely
 representative of atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no
 evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint increased opacity at the right lower lobe is likely representative of
 atelectasis.  However, an early developing pneumonia must be excluded in the
 proper clinical setting.
