                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new right IJ central line  // Eval new line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___, and CTA chest from earlier the same day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new right IJ central line terminates in the mid to low SVC. The ET tube and
 NG tube are unchanged from prior exam.
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Diffusely increased interstitial markings are
 again noted in the lungs bilaterally, along with engorged pulmonary
 vasculature, cardiomegaly, and bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with
 moderate pulmonary edema, similar to prior exams.  Opacity at the left lung
 base is again noted, consistent with atelectasis. No focal consolidation is
 seen and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ central line terminates in the mid to low SVC.
 
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
