                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // ? pecxr-? tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___, and CTA chest from and the same day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. And NG tube passes inferiorly off
 the image in the expected region of the stomach.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings are
 again seen, along with engorged pulmonary vasculature and cardiomegaly and
 bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Increased opacity at the left lung base compared to prior likely reflects
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
