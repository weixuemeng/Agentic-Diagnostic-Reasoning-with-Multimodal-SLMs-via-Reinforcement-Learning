                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size. Patchy calcification is noted along the
 aortic arch. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a mild
 interstitial abnormality mostly characterized by mild peribronchial cuffing.
 There is no upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature and the
 pulmonary vessels appear distinct. Neither hilum appears congested. The left
 cardiac apex is slightly obscured on the frontal view but probably due to a
 fat pad rather than a pulmonary opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality suggestive of airway inflammation or atypical
 pneumonia.
