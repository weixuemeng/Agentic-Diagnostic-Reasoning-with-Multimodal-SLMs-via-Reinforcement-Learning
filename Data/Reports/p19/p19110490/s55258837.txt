                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post craniotomy excision for a left frontal lobe lesion,
 evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is present with tip less than 3 cm from the carina. 
 Additionally, the ET tube cuff appears to be overinflated.  An NG tube is
 present with tip in the stomach but side holes near the GE junction.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is stable.  The lungs are
 well expanded.  A stable opacity obscuring the left hilus and causing tracheal
 deviation to the right is concerning for a mass and/or lymphadenopathy.  There
 is also mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube with tip in the proximal stomach, but side holes near the GE
 junction. Advancement is recommended. 
 2.  Overinflation of the ET tube cuff.  Additionally, ET tube should be
 withdrawn by several centimeters for more standard positioning.
 3.  Left hilar fullness concerning for lung malignancy. Chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation. 
 4.  New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
