                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe rotary dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine limits assessment of
 the chest.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear opacities are demonstrated in
 both lower lobes, likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe rotary dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
