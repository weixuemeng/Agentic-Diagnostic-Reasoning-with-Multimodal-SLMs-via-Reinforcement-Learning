 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:13 AM
  ___ year old woman with status post airways stent.
  Opacities in the right lobe are compatible with postsurgical changes and known
  metastatic disease. The visualized left lung is appears clear of
  consolidation. Extent within the airways are not well seen.  The cardiac
  silhouette is normal in size.
  
  TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in the
  upright position.
  
  COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and ___
  
  FINDINGS:  The airway stent is not well visualized on the current study. 
  Outside CT study demonstrated extensive nodular pleural disease which makes
  assessment for intraparenchymal disease difficult on this frontal film. 
  Compared to the prior chest x-ray in our system the amount of metastatic
  disease has substantially increased.  There is opacities in the right upper
  lobe and is unclear if these are due to infiltrate or the superimposed pleural
  disease.  Scarring in the left lateral lung is again visualized.  The cardiac
  silhouette is mildly enlarged, similar to prior.
  
  
  IMPRESSION:  Extensive metastatic disease makes assessment of the right lung
  difficult.  The stent is not adequately visualized
