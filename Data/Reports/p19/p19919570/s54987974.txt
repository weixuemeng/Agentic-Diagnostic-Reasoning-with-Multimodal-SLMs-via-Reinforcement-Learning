                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with brain ca also on warfarin s/p seizure please eval
 cardiopulm change / intracranial bleed
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip in the region of the right atrium. Midline
 sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valve are again seen.  Lung volumes
 are low limiting evaluation.  A similar overall pattern is seen compared with
 multiple prior imaging studies with prominent bronchovascular markings which
 in the setting of low lung volumes likely reflect bronchovascular crowding. 
 The possibility of mild pulmonary vascular congestion is difficult to exclude
 in the correct clinical setting.  There is no overt evidence for edema,
 effusion, pneumothorax or pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No overt signs of pneumonia or edema.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 difficult to exclude given extensive bronchovascular crowding in the setting
 of low lung volumes.
