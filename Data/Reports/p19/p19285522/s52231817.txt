                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  History of COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Hemidiaphragms are flattened suggesting hyperinflation.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion, although a small effusion would be difficult to exclude on
 the right, where there is persistent patchy posterior opacification in the
 right lower lobe.  Although the opacity seems more extensive on the frontal
 view, it is suspected that for the most part opacities have improved given
 substantial decrease on the lateral view.  However, opacification may wax and
 wane, not discernable on recent radiographs from ___ for example, but
 present on earlier ones from ___, with a very similar
 configuration.  Bones show abnormal sclerosis, which suggest metastatic
 disease, although not otherwise assessed in detail.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Waxing and waning opacity in the posterior right lower lobe,
 which appears overall less dense on this examination compared to the most
 recent one.  The possibility that this appearance may reflect recurrent
 infection in the same area is not excluded, however.
