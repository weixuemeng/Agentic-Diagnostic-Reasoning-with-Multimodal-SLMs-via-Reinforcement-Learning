 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky
 opacities at each lung base suggest minor atelectasis or scarring.  The chest
 appears hyperinflated.  Irregular pulmonary architecture is suggestive of
 underlying obstructive pulmonary disease.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Findings suggesting obstructive
 pulmonary disease.
