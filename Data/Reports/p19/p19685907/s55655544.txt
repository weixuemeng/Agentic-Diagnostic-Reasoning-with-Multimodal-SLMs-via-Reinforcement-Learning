                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A stable linear density projecting
 posteriorly on the lateral view is unchanged from multiple prior exams and
 likely represents a focus of scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
