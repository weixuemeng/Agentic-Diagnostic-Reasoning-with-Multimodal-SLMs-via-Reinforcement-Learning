                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:18 P.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status, new enteral feeding tube
 advanced.
 
 IMPRESSION:  One view of the chest and one view of the upper abdomen show that
 the tube, with the wire stylet in place, has been advanced substantially now
 in a large loop in the stomach.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement, including hilar
 enlargement are longstanding.  There is as yet no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion.  Right PIC line ends in the upper right atrium, at the level 6 cm
 below the carina and would need to be withdrawn at least 2 cm to reposition
 with confidence in the low SVC, if desired.
