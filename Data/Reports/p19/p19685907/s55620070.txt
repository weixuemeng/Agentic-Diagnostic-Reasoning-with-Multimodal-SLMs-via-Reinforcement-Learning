 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of treated latent tuberculosis, on
 hemodialysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Heart is still moderately
 enlarged and the hilar and other central pulmonary vasculature is still
 engorged.  Previous pleural effusions have essentially resolved.  There is the
 suggestion of bronchiectasis in the right mid and lower lung zones, which is
 best evaluated with CT scanning.  There is no consolidation or evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.
