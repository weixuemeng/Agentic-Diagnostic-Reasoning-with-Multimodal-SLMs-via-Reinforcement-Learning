                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Femoral neck fracture, preoperative evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is top normal in size.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Prominence of the hila bilaterally is unchanged.  Low lung volumes are present
 which result in crowding of the bronchovascular vascular structures.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion may be present.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are
 nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Ossific density within the
 right acromiohumeral interval may reflect a loose body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities possibly reflective of
 atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is recommended to exclude infection.
