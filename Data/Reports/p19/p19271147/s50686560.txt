                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes and no
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  Mild tortuosity of the
 descending aorta is noted.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Left sided rib
 fractures, involving left posterior 5th rib and left lateral ___, ___ and
 possibly 4th ribs are of indeterminate age; given lack of recent trauma or
 point tenderness at these locations, they are more likely not acute. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Left sided rib fractures, as
 above, indeterminate age; given lack of recent trauma or point tenderness at
 these locations, they are more likely not acute.
