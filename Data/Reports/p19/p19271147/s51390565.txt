                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new dobhoff, eval position  // eval
 position of dobhoff
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Dobhoff tube is present.  On view 1., the tip overlies the distal
 mediastinum, possibly reaching the GE junction.  On view 2., the tip is not
 visualized and presumably extends beneath the GE junction.  Based on this
 common additional view to include the abdomen would be required to see the
 radiopaque tip.
 
 Compared with the prior film, cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  However, there is increased vascular engorgement and mild vascular
 blurring at the bases, consistent with CHF.  The possibility of small
 effusions cannot be excluded.  PICC line again noted in the mid to distal SVC.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. On the second film, the radiopaque Dobhoff tip tube extends beyond the GE
 junction, into the abdomen, but is not included on the film.
 2. Compared with the prior film, there is now evidence of CHF, with vascular
 engorgement and probable interstitial edema at the bases.  Possible small
 bilateral effusions.
