                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, tracheal stent.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest demonstrates an unchanged position of tracheal
 stent. The heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia seen on the radiograph.  Again seen is a left Port-A-Cath with tip
 terminating in the proximal left brachiocephalic vein.  Postoperative changes
 after upper lobectomy are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumonia on chest x-ray.  Tree-in-___ opacities and mucous plugging seen
 in the right lower lobe on the recent CT are not clearly observed on these
 radiographs and are probably too subtle to visualize radiographically.
