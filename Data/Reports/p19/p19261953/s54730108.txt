 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodular lesions consistent with metastases are
 overall more conspicuous as compared to the prior study.  No definite new
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is persistent blunting of the costophrenic
 angles, suggesting small pleural effusions, increased at least on the right. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the proximal right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules overall appear more conspicuous as
 compared to the prior study, which may be due to differences in technique
 /penetration, although is concerning for slight progression of disease.  No
 definite new focal consolidation seen.
 
 Small right pleural effusion, new/increased compared to the prior study. 
 Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
