                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and weight loss
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  At least 2 nodular opacities are
 seen within the right upper lobe, the largest measuring up to 12 mm, and an
 additional nodular opacity is seen projecting over the left mid lung laterally
 measuring up to 10 mm.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Marked gaseous distension of colonic loops of bowel in
 the upper abdomen are noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Several nodular opacities within both lungs measuring up to 12 mm which
 require further assessment with CT of the chest if no previous imaging studies
 are available for comparison.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Marked gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel in the upper abdomen. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended and consider dedicated imaging of the
 abdomen for further assessment if needed.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1.  Comparison with previous imaging of the chest is
 recommended, and if none are available, CT of the chest is necessary.
 2.  Marked gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel in the upper abdomen. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended and consider dedicated imaging of the
 abdomen for further assessment if needed.
