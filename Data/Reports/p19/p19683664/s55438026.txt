                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough x2 weeks, mild shortness of breath, crackles at the
 right lung base.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An ICD is seen with leads extending into the right atrium and right ventricle.
 An aortic abdominal aorta stent is incidentally noted, unchanged and
 appearance from the prior examination.  The lungs appear hyperinflated with
 flattening of the bilateral diaphragms.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  The heart size
 is normal.  A focal convexity at the left cardiomediastinal contour is see
 just below the left hilum, likely due to rotation. Incidentally noted are
 several healed right rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Hyperexpanded lungs suggestive of COPD.  
 
 2. New focal convexity of the left cardiomediastinal contour just below the
 left hilum, possibly due to slight patient rotation. Recommend repeating the
 radiograph with proper patient positioning to exclude a mediastinal mass.
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to the office of Dr. ___ on ___
 at 11:30 am.
