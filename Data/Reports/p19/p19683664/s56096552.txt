 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening DOE, mild hypoxemia, ?orthopnea.
 crackles and ___ edema  // ?CHF vs COPD exacerbation     WORSENING DOE,MILD
 HYPOXEMIA,CRACKLES,___ EDEMA ? ORTHOPNEA,CHF VS COPD EXACERBATION
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new moderate loculated right-sided pleural effusion with associated

 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  The rounded contour seen at the left
 hilum is more prominent on the current study compared with ___, in
 spite of improved positioning and a dedicated chest CT is recommended for

 chamber pacemaker leads in standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New moderate loculated right-sided pleural effusion.
