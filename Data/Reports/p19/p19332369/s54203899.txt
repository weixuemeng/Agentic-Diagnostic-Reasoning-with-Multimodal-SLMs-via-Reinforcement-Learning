                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiac
 sihouettle is mildly enlarged, slightly accentuated by low lung columes. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Focal opacity seen in
 the left lower lobe, best seen on the lateral view.  There is no other focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The upper abdomen and bones
 are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette accentuated by low lung volumes but
 component of pericardial effusion should be considered in this patient with
 pericarditis. Correlate with echocardiogram.  
 2. Left lower lobe focal opacity, potentially atelectasis although infection
 is possible.
