                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Multiple rib fractures and clavicle fracture.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a
 small left pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  The lower lobe opacity consistent with contusion has improved.
 Left upper lobe opacity likely contusion or aspiration is grossly unchanged.
 
 Left clavicle and multiple left rib fractures are again noted.
