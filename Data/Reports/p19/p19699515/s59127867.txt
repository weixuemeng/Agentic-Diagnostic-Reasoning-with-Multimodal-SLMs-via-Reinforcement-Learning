                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fall from roof, polytrauma, multiple rib fractures.  Small left
 apical pneumothorax.  Left clavicle fracture.  Assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the slightly displaced left
 rib fractures, the displaced left clavicular fracture and the minimal left
 apical pneumothorax are unchanged.  There also is unchanged evidence of a
 small left pleural effusion as well as of a minimal area of increased opacity
 at the level of the right upper lobe.  This opacity, however, appears to
 decrease in severity.
 
 Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged opacities in the left apex. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
