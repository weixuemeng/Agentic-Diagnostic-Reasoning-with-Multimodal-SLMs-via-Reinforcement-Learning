                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is a small left apical pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Cardiac size is top normal, is accentuated by the low lung volumes and
 projections.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have minimally increased. 
 Left perihilar and bibasilar opacities, left greater than right and minimal
 opacities in the right upper lobe are grossly unchanged, are consistent with
 atelectasis on the right base, contusion in the left perihilar region and
 laceration and contusion in the left lower lobe.
