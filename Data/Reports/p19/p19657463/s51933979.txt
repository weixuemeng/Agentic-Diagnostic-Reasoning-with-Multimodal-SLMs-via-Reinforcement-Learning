                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p stroke, w/ tongue swelling, acute
 decompensation on non-rebreather  // ?bronchial plugging
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral single lead pacemaker partially obscures the left mid lung. 
 The chin and associated soft tissues partially obscures the lung apices. 
 Suboptimal aeration of the left lower lobe may be due to overlaying soft
 tissue, but there may be a component of atelectasis or aspiration.  The right
 lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 Dense vascular calcifications are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible left lower lobe atelectasis or aspiration.  A repeat PA and lateral
 radiograph would be helpful.
