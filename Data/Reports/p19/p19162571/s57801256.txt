                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions have decreased on the
 left and stable on the right.  Dense opacity in the right upper lobe is fluid
 in the fissure.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is obscured by the
 pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  Bibasilar atelectases have improved on the
 left.  Port-A-Cath is in a standard position.  Bilateral pleural catheters are
 in unchanged position.
