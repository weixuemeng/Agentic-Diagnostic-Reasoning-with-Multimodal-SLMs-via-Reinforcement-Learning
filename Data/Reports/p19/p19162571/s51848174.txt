 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-existing left pleural effusion is constant.
 
 On the right, the overall extent of the effusion is constant but the
 distribution of the effusion has changed, with new occurrence of organized
 parts of the effusion localized in the fissures and visible both on the
 frontal and the lateral radiographs.
 
 The bilateral atelectatic changes, predominating at the lung bases, are
 constant.  In the well-ventilated areas of the lung, there is no evidence of
 pathologic changes.  The abdominal stent is in unchanged position.
