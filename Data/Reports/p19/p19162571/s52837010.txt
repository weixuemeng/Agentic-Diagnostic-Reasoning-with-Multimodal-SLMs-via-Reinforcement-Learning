 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:42 PM
   Interval substantial decrease in size of right pleural effusion status post
  thoracentesis without detectable pneumothorax. Retrocardiac density persists,
  likely atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right
 thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are within normal limits.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip
 is at the level of low SVC.  Substantial decrease in pleural effusion on the
 right is demonstrated.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  Left basal
 opacity most likely reflects atelectasis and appears to be unchanged since the
 prior study.  Infectious process would be another possibility in both lung
 bases, left more than right.
