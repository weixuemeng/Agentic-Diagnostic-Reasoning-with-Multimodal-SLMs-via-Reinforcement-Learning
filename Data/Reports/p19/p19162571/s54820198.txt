 INDICATION:  Left Port-A-Cath placement in a ___-year-old female with

 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available for comparison.  The study is
 read in conjunction with spot fluoroscopic images from Port-A-Cath placement

 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new focal

 peribronchial infiltrate.  There is also a new hazy opacification extending
 from the right lung base to the level of the transverse aorta, consistent with
 large right pleural effusion.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath is in standard
 position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax or
 significant pulmonary edema.  A biliary stent is seen in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Left lower lung pneumonia and large right pleural effusion, new
 since CT scan from one month prior.  Left Port-A-Cath in standard position,
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
