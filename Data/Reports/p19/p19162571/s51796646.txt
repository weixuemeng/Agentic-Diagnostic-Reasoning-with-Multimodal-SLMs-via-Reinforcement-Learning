                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, known malignant pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to large right, and small to moderate left, pleural effusions are re-
 demonstrated with a left basilar pleural catheter again noted.  Fluid
 continues to be a loculated within the fissures, but slightly decreased
 compared to the prior study.  There are persistent bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Several clips are
 demonstrated within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen with a biliary
 stent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small-to-moderate left and moderate-to-large right pleural effusions with
 fluid loculated in the fissures.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis.  The
 effusions appear slightly decreased in size compared to most recent chest
 radiograph.
