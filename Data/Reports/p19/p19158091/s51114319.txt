                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been no appreciable change in
 the appearance of the chest.  No new areas of consolidation are evident to
 suggest the presence of pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation, as calcified pleural
 plaques partially obscure the lung parenchyma on this single projection.
