  Diffuse bilateral opacities have overall unchanged compared to the prior exam,
  consistent with underlying Legionella infection. There has been an interval
  increase in left lower lobe atelectasis. There may be a small left pleural
  effusion. NG tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this
  film.
