                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, question intubated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:17 a.m.
 
 Lines and tubes are grossly unchanged.  The NG tube may extend slightly
 further.  Multiple lines overlying the chest are likely EKG leads.  Again seen
 are diffuse bilateral opacities.  Hazy opacity at the bases could reflect
 effusions.  Possible slight improvement in the upper zones compared with one
 day earlier.  Overall, there has been interval obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm, which could reflect some interval right lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar.
