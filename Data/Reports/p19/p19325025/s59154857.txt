                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Legionella, ARDS s/p extubation @ PEEP ___ 
 // interval imaging
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Both lung volumes and the severity of generalized opacification in both lungs
 have improved. It is not possible to see the margins of vessels in the left
 lung. Some pleural effusion, probably substantial is still present on both
 sides of the chest, left greater than right. Erect frontal or lateral
 radiography would be helpful in determining the volume of pleural fluid.
 
 The esophageal tube passes into the stomach and out of view. ET tube and right
 internal jugular line are in standard placements. A section of thin bore
 tubing crosses the thoracic inlet from the left to right and loops in the
 midline above the mandible. It needs to be identified by the clinical house
 staff to make sure that it is not a feeding tube looped in the hypopharynx.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to the patient's nurse ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 9:31 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
 She will ask house staff to localize the unidentified tubing.
