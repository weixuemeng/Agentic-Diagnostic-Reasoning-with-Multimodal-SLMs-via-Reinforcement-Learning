                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 NG tube again seen. On the current film, it extends beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film. Also, if clinically indicated, chest CT could help to better define
 the etiology of the bilateral lung opacification.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with legionella PNa, intubated  // interval
 imaging
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 4:57 am
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to earlier the same day and allowing for differences in technique,
 the degree of opacification seen in both lungs appears to have progressed
 slightly, with more opacity now seen in the mid and upper zones on both sides.
 The possibility of some associated pleural fluid cannot be excluded, but much
 of this is likely accounted for by parenchymal opacification. The cardiac
 silhouette is now less well seen on both sides due to this opacification. The
 right paratracheal soft tissues are again noted to be prominent -- ? due to
 right-sided vascular engorgement.
 
 The ET tube lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina and the right IJ
 central line overlies the distal SVC, both similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacification of both lungs.
