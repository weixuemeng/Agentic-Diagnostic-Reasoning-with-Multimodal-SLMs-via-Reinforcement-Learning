                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o female with new diagnosis of CHF and possible pneumonia
 and intubated // eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall no significant interval change from the prior exam.  The patient is
 rotated. The ETT tip ends approximately 5 cm from the carina.  The right
 subclavian PICC line ends in the mid SVC.  The left pigtail drain projects
 over the lower left hemithorax.   Bilateral left greater right pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Opacification of the left
 lower hemithorax with slight leftward shift despite coexisting pleural
 effusion suggests substantial atelectasis, overall similar. Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.  No pneumothorax.  Opacities in the right hemithorax
 suggest pulmonary vascular congestion. Right pulmonary edema has since
 decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal interval decrease since ___ in mild right pulmonary edema.
 Otherwise, no significant interval change.
