                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP semierect portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated with fever  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  ETT tip is in standard position. The right subclavian
 PICC ends in the mid SVC.  The left PICC catheter is incompletely visualized
 and its tip is not seen.  An enteric tube traverses the diaphragm.
 
 Lung volumes remain very low.  Moderate right pulmonary edema and dependent
 pleural effusion.  Evaluation of the left lung is limited as the moderately
 enlarged heart and mediastinum obscures most of the left lung.  Left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis is likely.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Of note, the patient has severe bronchomalacia on CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right pulmonary edema and effusion. Limited evaluation of the
 left lung.
 2.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded and dedicated Chest CT would be required.
