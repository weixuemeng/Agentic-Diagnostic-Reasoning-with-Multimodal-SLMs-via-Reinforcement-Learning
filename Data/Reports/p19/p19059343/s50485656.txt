                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiogenic shock, PNA, s/p placement of
 chest tube and aggressive diuresis  // pulmonary edema? improved aeration?
 placement of lines/tubes
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 ET tube tip approximately 5.7 cm above the carina at the level of the lower
 clavicular heads.  NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A
 right subclavian PICC line tip most likely overlies proximal SVC, allowing for
 rotation.  Additional tubing with pigtail tip over the lower left chest or
 upper left abdomen is again noted.
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly.  On today's exam, the focal opacities in
 the left lung apex appear slightly improved.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation with air bronchograms remains present, similar to the prior
 film.  Vascular plethora in the right lung is consistent with ongoing CHF. 
 Probable small right of fusion, with right base atelectasis, similar to the
 prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Partial interval improvement of opacity in the left lung apex compared with
 the most recent prior film.  Compared with ___ at 08:35 a.m., aeration at the
 left lung apex has clearly improved.
 2. Continuing left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Mediastinal
 shift difficult in light of the patient rotation, but may very well be similar
 to the prior film.
 3. CHF, with suspected small right effusion as well is right base atelectasis.
