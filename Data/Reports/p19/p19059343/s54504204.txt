                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, new WBC, sob  // r/o pna, pulm edema 
 r/o pna, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is somewhat greater radiodensity to the right lower lung than the
 remainder of the right lung on the frontal view, but there is no corresponding
 finding on the lateral, so I hesitate to call this a new pneumonia.  Left
 lower lobe atelectasis and pulmonary edema have both improved since ___
 and a severe cardiomegaly is less pronounced.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion.
