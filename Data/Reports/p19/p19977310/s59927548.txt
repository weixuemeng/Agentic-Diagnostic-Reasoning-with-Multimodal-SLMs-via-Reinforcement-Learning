                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, fevers, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A right IJ
 dialysis catheter is seen with its tip in the expected location of the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is mild pulmonary venous congestion with probable
 mild pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  In the presence
 of pulmonary edema the possibility of a superimposed mild/early pneumonia is
 impossible to exclude, though none is clearly seen.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is top normal though stable.  Aortic calcifications are noted.  Bony
 structures appear intact though there are degenerative spurs along the mid
 thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema without definite signs of pneumonia though
 post-diuresis films may be obtained to further assess if clinically warranted.
