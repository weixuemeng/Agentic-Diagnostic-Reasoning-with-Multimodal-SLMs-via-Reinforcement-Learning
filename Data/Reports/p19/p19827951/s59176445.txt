                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic
 arch is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Streaky linear opacity projecting over the left mid lung suggests
 minor atelectasis or scarring that is unchanged.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No rib fracture is identified in
 this single limited view.  Mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature is
 again centered along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of injury.
