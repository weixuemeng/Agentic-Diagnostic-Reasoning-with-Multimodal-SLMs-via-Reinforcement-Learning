                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement in a patient with intracranial
 hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an appropriately positioned
 endotracheal tube, 5.3 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube enters the
 stomach, though side port appears above the gastroesophageal junction.  Lung
 volumes are markedly low.  This causes exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal
 contour as well as crowding of pulmonary vasculature. Bibasilar airspace
 opacities most likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. Side port of orogastric tube
 appears just above the gastroesophageal junction and should be slightly
 advanced. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings regarding the positioning of the OG tube were
 communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 15:40.
