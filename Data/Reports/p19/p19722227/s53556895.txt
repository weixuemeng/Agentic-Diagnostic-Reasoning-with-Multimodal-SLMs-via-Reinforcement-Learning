                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rectal bleeding.  Question perforation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The patient is status post coronary
 artery bypass graft surgery.  There is mild unfolding and calcification along
 the aorta.  Hilar contours are unchanged.  Within the background of slightly
 generalized worsening of lung markings there is a focal interstitial
 opacification at the right lung base, probably in the right lower lobe.  The
 appearance is highly nonspecific.  In the absence of pulmonary symptoms,
 atelectasis or scarring could be considered.  Airway inflammation is a
 differential consideration and in the appropriate clinical setting, an acute
 process such as pneumonia would not be excluded.  The lungs are hyperinflated.
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative changes
 are present along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague but somewhat focal interstitial opacification at the right
 lung base, highly nonspecific.  Scarring atelectasis or airway inflammation
 could be considered; in the appropriate clinical setting, if matching
 pulmonary symptoms are present, however, pneumonia would not be excluded.
