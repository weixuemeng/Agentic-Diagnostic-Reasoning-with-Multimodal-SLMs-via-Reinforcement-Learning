 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute shortness of breath, interval worsening of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the quality of the image is
 reduced due to respiratory motion artifacts.  However, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has mildly increased and there is increasing pulmonary edema with
 mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pleural effusions.  No focal parenchymal
 opacity suggesting pneumonia.
