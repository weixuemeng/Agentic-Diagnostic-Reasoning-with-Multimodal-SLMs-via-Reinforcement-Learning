                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, on amiodarone.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  However, there is no acute focal
 pneumonia or evidence of interstitial prominence to suggest amiodarone
 toxicity.  No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 Evidence of healed rib fractures on the left.
 
 Of incidental note is extensive calcification in the region of the carotid
 bifurcations.
