                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, x-ray earlier today recommended another x-ray due
 to poor positioning on latera.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm again noted.  The lungs appear clear without focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  Bony structures appear intact.  Prominent anterior
 osteophytes in the thoracic spine likely account for prevertebral opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings.  Prominent anterior osteophytosis in the thoracic spine
 likely accounts for prevertebral opacity seen on prior imaging study.
