                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The anterior lower chest is cut off from the image on the lateral view.  Lung
 volumes are low, likely secondary to lack of full inspiration.  No pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 normal in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  The hila are within normal
 limits.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with prominent
 anterior osteophytes are moderate.  A prevertebral density likely represents
 projection artifact from the scapula, but a prevertebral lesion cannot be
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumonia.
 2.  Prevertebral density likely represents projection artifact from the
 scapula, but a prevertebral lesion cannot be excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat lateral chest radiograph with appropriate
 positioning to exclude prevertebral lesion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 16:40 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
