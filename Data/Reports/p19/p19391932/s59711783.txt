                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and crackles at bilateral bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bibasilar opacities with silhouetting of the
 hemidiaphragms consistent with moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis, increased in comparison to prior study from ___.  It is worth noting that an overlying developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette also appears enlarged in comparison to prior
 study suggesting heart failure.  Otherwise, atherosclerotic calcifications are
 again noted at the aortic arch.  Known sclerotic focus in the T7 vertebral
 body is not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities consistent with
 worsening pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette
 also appears enlarged in comparison to prior study and the combination of
 these findings is suggestive of heart failure.
