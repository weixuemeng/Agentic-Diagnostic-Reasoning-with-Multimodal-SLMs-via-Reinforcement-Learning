                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath and chest pain, assess of consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The lungs appear essentially without definite signs of pneumonia or
 overt CHF.  Calcific density projecting over the mediastinum may represent
 vascular calcifications, though is somewhat atypical in distribution.  There
 is an unfolded thoracic aorta noted.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, with unfolded thoracic aorta.  Calcifications
 projecting over the mediastinum likely correspond with the thoracic aorta,
 though distribution is somewhat atypical.  Consider non-emergent CT to further
 assess.
