 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with stable cardiac
 enlargement. There is possibly a small hiatal hernia. Overall, there is
 increasing opacity at the left base which is felt to more likely reflect an
 increasing left effusion, although airspace consolidation cannot be entirely
 excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Right lung is
 grossly clear.  Prominent right hilum most likely reflects prominent
 vasculature suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension in the
 setting of known emphysema when correlated with a chest CT dated ___.
