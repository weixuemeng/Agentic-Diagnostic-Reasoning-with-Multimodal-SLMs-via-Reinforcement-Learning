                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for edema or pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views chest demonstrate decreased lung volumes.
 There is dense left retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis,
 infection or aspiration.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 which may represent a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 The right hilum is prominent but stable compared to multiple prior
 radiographs. The aorta is ectatic and tortuous and the heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There are degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis, infection or
 aspiration.  
 2.  The left costophrenic angle is blunted. A small left pleural effusion is
 not excluded.
