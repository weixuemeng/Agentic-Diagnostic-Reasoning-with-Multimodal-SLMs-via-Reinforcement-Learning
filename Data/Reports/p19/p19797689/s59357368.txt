                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea since yesterday, crackles at lung bases, history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is grossly stable prominence of the right hilum.  There is slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft
 tissue although trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  The lateral
 view also suggests posterior basal consolidation, although not well seen on
 the frontal view, could be in the left lower lung.  The aorta remains
 calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Posterior basilar opacity best seen on the lateral view, raises concern for
 underlying consolidation which may be due to infection or aspiration.  Not
 well appreciated on the frontal view.
