                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and leukocytosis, evaluation for retrocardiac opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, reflecting improved ventilation or a stronger inspiratory effort. 
 Size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The pre-described
 retrocardiac opacity could be caused by a tortuous descending aorta or by a
 hiatal hernia.  Unfortunately, the lateral radiograph does not allow to make
 this differentiation.  In addition, there is a small pleural scar that causes
 blunting of the left costodiaphragmatic sinus.
 
 In almost unchanged manner, an area of atelectasis, potentially with slight
 bronchiectatic changes, is seen in the lower aspect of the right hilus.  No
 right pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
