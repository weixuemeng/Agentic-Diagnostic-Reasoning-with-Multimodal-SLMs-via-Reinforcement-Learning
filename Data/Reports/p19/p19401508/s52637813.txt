                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Multiple scattered nodular and patchy
 opacities have increased since the prior exam, possibly representing enlarging
 pulmonary nodules or infection.  Right medial lung base opacity is most
 consistent with infection.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could
 represent pleural thickening or a small pleural effusion.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Thoracic spinal fusion hardware is in
 stable position with pedicle screws and laminar hooks.  Severe compression
 deformity of a mid-thoracic spine vertebral body is similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increase in size and number of multiple scattered and patchy opacities, as
 well as new medial right lung base opacity, consistent enlarging pulmonary
 nodules and concern for underlying infection.
