                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic lung cancer, presenting with left-sided
 chest pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT.  Chest radiographs are not currently
 available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Bilateral
 spinal rods are seen.  Left basilar atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is
 slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to a very
 trace pleural effusion.  Scattered patchy opacities are seen in the right
 lower lung, some of which may be due to pulmonary nodules, but appear greater
 in extent as compared to the prior CT and may be due to areas of underlying
 infection or worsening disease.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  There is stable severe compression of the mid thoracic
 vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of patchy right lower lung opacity appear increased, could
 be due to pulmonary nodules with areas of infection or progression of disease.
 Possible very trace left pleural effusion.
