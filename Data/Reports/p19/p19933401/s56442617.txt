                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle, raising concern for a trace left
 pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
