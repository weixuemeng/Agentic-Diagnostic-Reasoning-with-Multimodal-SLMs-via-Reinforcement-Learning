                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation requiring assessment of
 ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate ET tube in place with
 the tip 5.3 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes are seen, likely secondary
 to poor inspiration.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is seen with some elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube in appropriate position.  Left basilar atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, unremarkable chest radiograph.
