                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and
 hypertension, now with increased oxygen requirements, here to evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast dated ___.  Chest
 radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact
 and aligned sternal wires.  A mitral valve prosthesis is unchanged.  There is
 dense calcification throughout the aortic arch extending into the descending
 thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal contours are prominent, but stable.  There is
 slight deviation of the trachea to the right by the aortic knob.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  A chronic moderate left
 pleural effusion is unchanged with opacification at the left lung base, likely
 reflecting associated compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  A small
 right pleural effusion is increased from ___.  The lungs are
 otherwise relatively clear without new focal airspace opacity.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  An
 exaggerated thoracic kyphosis is noted with hypertrophic degenerative changes
 at the thoracic spine.  Degenerative changes of the right shoulder joint are
 also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No new focal airspace opacity.
 2.  Chronic moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
 
 3.  Slightly increased size of small right pleural effusion from ___.
 4.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
