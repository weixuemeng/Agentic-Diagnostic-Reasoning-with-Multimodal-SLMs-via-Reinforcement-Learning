                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mild pulmonary edema.  However, the lung volumes have increased, likely
 reflecting a stronger inspiratory effort.  The extent of the chronic left
 pleural effusion has decreased.  The effusion is now limited to the 3 to 4 cm
 above the diaphragm.  The effusion is better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal image.
 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, unchanged alignment of sternal wires, unchanged
 massive aortic calcification.
