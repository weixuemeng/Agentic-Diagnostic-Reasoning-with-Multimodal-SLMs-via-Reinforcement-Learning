                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates
 within the mid SVC.  There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable and unchanged.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.  Ill-defined opacity within the left lung base may reflect an
 area of atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined patchy opacity in left lung base.  This could reflect
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
