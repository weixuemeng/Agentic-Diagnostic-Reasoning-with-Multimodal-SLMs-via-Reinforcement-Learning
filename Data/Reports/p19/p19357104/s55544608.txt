                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph was provided. 
 Port-A-Cath again noted residing over the right mid chest with the catheter
 tip extending into the expected region of the superior vena cava.  Lung
 volumes are quite low, which limits the evaluation.  Bronchovascular crowding
 likely accounts for the left lung base opacity.  No definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite signs of acute intrathoracic
 process.
