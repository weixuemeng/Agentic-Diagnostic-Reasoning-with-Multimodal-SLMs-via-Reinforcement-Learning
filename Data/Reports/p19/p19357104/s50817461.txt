                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Frontal lobe dementia, chronic Foley, admitted with fever
 and shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Left lower lobe opacities are unchanged, worrisome for aspiration,
 as are the right suprahilar opacities.  There are no new lung abnormalities,
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion or CHF.  Right Porta-A-Cath tip is in the
 mid-to-lower SVC.
