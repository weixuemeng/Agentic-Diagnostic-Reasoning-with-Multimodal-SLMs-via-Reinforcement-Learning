                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recently diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia here with
 persistent cough and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle patchy opacity over the left lung base raises concern for
 pneumonia.  Additionally, there is subtle opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung, which may be additional site of infection.  Given that there are
 no priors for comparison, cannot discern whether findings have improved,
 stayed the same or worsened since the prior study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral, subtle patchy opacities, as above, concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia.  In the absence of priors currently available for
 comparison, cannot determine whether findings have increased, decreased or
 remained the same.  Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for further
 evaluation.
