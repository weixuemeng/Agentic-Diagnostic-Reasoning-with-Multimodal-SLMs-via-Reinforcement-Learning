                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypertension, undifferentiated.  Transferred
 for hypertension and unresponsive.  Intubated with central line prior to
 transfer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest x-ray performed at ___ from
 earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with
 tip approximately 7 mm from the carina which is difficult to clearly see. 
 Left-sided central venous catheter tip projects over the distal
 brachiocephalic/upper SVC, although its tip is not well seen.  Relatively low
 lung volumes are seen without focal consolidation or large effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are identified.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at
 the aortic arch.  Surgical clips project over the right lateral chest wall. 
 Surgical clips are also seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube seen with tip likely under 1 cm from the carina
 and should be withdrawn for optimal positioning.  Left-sided central venous
 catheter tip not clearly delineated, but likely in the region of the distal
 brachiocephalic/upper SVC.
