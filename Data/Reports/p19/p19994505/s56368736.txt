                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 is at the lower clavicular level, approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. 
 Enteric tube has been removed.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
 with the dual-channel pacer leads in place.  Evidence of elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure is again seen.  Increased opacification at the bases could
 merely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical situation,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
