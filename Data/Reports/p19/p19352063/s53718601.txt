 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal
 size or perhaps mildly enlarged, although its contours are not fully assessed
 given AP portable technique and low lung volumes.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascularity is mildly prominent
 and indistinct, suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
