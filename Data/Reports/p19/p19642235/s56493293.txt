                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, orthopnea in stg of steroids.  //
 interval change? c/f CHF exacerbation and volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___:50, I doubt significant interval change.  Again
 seen are sternotomy wires, including a fractured uppermost sternotomy wire, 
 and mediastinal clips.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, but no other evidence for CHF. There is minimal
 linear atelectasis and/or scarring at the left lung base, unchanged.  No focal
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No frank consolidation or effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Right-sided central line tip overlies the distal SVC, similar to the prior
 film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No significant change compared with ___.
 2. No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 3. Fractured upper most sternotomy wire noted.
