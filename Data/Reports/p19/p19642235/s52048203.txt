                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary
 artery bypass surgery.  Heart size is normal, and mediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  Previously present linear focus of atelectasis in the
 left lower lobe has resolved and the left pleural effusion is no longer
 apparent.  On the lateral radiograph, subtle peribronchial opacities are
 present in the retrocardiac region and likely correspond to the left lower
 lobe on the frontal view.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are otherwise clear. 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place within the trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle retrocardiac opacity, which could reflect either
 atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be helpful in
 this regard.
