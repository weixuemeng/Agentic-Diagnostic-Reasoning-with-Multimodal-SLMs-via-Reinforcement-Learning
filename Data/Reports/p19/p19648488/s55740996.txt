                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall, poor historian.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly appears unchanged, compatible
 with trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Partially
 imaged is an aortic stent graft within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
