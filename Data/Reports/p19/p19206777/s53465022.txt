                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pacing-induced CHF  evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest wall pacemaker is seen with leads in unchanged position.
 Since the prior radiograph, there appears to be increased consolidation at the
 left base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, possibly due to volume
 loss; however, this may be due to technical reasons.  The right lung is clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Increased opacification of the left retrocardiac region and base, which may be
 due to increased volume loss or technical reasons.
