                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New oxygen requirement.  Rule out pulmonary edema, pneumonia.
 
 Chest, two views.  No previous chest radiographs on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and
 right ventricle.  There is borderline cardiomegaly with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  There is increased
 density at the left base, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Minimal atelectasis at the right
 base, with probable small right effusion.  Slight patchy opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic region may be accentuated due to patient rotation, but the
 possibility of a focal infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  Question
 calcification versus stent in upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Background COPD.
 
 2.  Borderline cardiomegaly.  Dual-lead pacemaker.
 
 3.  Bilateral small effusions with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 4.  Atelectasis with possible small opacity at right base.
