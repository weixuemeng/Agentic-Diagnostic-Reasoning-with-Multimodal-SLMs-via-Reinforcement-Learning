                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is enlarged, as before.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device
 appears in a similar configuration.  Mild unfolding and calcification
 involving the thoracic aorta appears similar.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities are nonspecific as to etiology and appear slightly decreased within
 the left lower lobe.  Interstitial pulmonary edema has also improved.  There
 is a small right-sided pleural effusion that appears increased with blunting
 of the left posterior costophrenic sulcus that may reflect a tiny effusion
 which is unchanged.  Degenerative changes along the thoracic spine are
 similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in interstitial edema and bibasilar opacities.  Small
 but apparently increased right-sided pleural effusion.
