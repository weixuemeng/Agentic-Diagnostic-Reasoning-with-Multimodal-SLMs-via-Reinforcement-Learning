                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Patient is
 extremely kyphotic.  The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation; however,
 there are diffusely increased interstitial markings throughout, potentially
 due to chronic lung disease or mild edema.  There is also a curvilinear likely
 calcific density projecting over left mid lung, potentially along the pleura. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.
 Kyphosis again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased interstitial markings of the lungs,
 potentially due to chronic lung disease; however, component of mild edema is
 also possible.  Curvilinear calcific density projecting over the left lung,
 potentially along the pleura, however, also might be in the lung.  No prior
 for comparison.  No confluent consolidation.
