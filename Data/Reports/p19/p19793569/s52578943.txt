                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and congested cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There
 may be mild vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are similar to the prior studies.  There may be mild prominence in
 the region of the ascending aorta, and aortic dilatation or lymphadenopathy is
 not excluded.  Findings could be further assessed on a non-urgent chest CT.
