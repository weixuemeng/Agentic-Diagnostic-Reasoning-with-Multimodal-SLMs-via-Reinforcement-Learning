                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent aspiration, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  As a result, the size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly
 increased and there is crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at
 the lung bases.  However, no focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia
 are seen.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
