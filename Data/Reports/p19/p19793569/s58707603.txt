                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, hypoxia, fever  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Lung volumes are slightly low. 
 Increased perihilar opacities may be accentuated by the technique but the
 indistinctness of the more distal pulmonary vessels is suggestive of mild
 edema.  Retrocardiac opacitiesmay likely represent a combination of edema and
 atelectasis however superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bones and the upper abdomen are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval development of mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Increased retrocardiac opacification may relate to a combination of edema
 atelectasis however superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
