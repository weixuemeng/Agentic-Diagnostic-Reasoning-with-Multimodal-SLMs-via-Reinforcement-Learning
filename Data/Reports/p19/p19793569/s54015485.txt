                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Lung volumes are slightly
 low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild patchy opacities in the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis. Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
