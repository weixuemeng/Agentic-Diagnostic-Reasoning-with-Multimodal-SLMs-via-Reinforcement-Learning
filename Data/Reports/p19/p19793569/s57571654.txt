                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever and cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes and mild
 patient motion limit the assessment.  Underpenetration on the lateral view
 also limits assessment significantly.  Allowing for limitations, there is no
 overt sign of pneumonia.  A subtle pneumonia would be impossible to exclude
 given technical limitations.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Prominence of the central
 pulmonary hilar bronchovascular markings likely reflects technique.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam without overt signs of pneumonia or edema.  If there is further
 concern a repeat exam with more optimized technique is advised.
