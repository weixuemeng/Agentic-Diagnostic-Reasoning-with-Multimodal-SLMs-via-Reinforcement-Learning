                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right sided Pnemuthorax  // Chest tube
 placed, please check for placement and PTX sixe
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent chest radiograph of less than 1 hr earlier, a right pigtail
 pleural catheter is been placed, with decrease in size of right pneumothorax,
 with small residual pneumothorax remaining. Right upper lobe has partially
 re-expanded. Right main bronchus appears depressed compared to baseline CT of
 ___ with adjacent increased opacity in the right paratracheal
 region. It is uncertain whether this represents residual collapsed lung or a
 hematoma. Exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent development of a small
 right pleural effusion.
