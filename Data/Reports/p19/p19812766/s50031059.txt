                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph excludes the right costophrenic
 angle.  An NG tube is in place, the tip of which is superimposed upon the
 expected region of the body of the stomach.  Note is made of an intrathoracic
 stomach fundus, better appreciated on CT performed same day, new since
 ___.  The lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size, the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of an NG tube, the tip of which is in the
 expected region of the stomach, with a similar appearance to intrathoracic
 stomach compared with CT earlier this evening. New transdiaphragmatic
 herniation of gastric fundus suggests acute exacerbation of chronic left
 central diaphragmatic rupture or hernia.
