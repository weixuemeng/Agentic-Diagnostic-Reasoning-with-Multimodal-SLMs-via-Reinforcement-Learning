                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of left pneumothorax, status post
 chest tube placement.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A left-sided chest tube terminates within
 the left lung apex.  There is persistent opacification of the left lung base
 likely related to atelectasis.  Overall, aeration of the left lung base
 appears slightly improved.  Linear opacities within the lower left lung are
 likely related to areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion is identified.  The right lung is clear.  No residual pneumothorax is
 evident.  There is no vascular congestion or edema.  Visualized
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Subcutaneous air along
 the left chest wall appears similar to prior and is likely related to prior
 placement of a chest drain.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left chest tube in standard expected position.  No residual pneumothorax.
 2.  Slight improved aeration of the left lung base with persistent probable
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
