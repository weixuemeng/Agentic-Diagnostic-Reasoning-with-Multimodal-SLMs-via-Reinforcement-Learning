                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left pneumothorax status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Only trace residual left pneumothorax remains after placement of a
 chest tube.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents persistent atelectatic
 lung and some smaller component of the previously large pleural effusion.  The
 right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny residual left pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 Retrocardiac density likely secondary to persistent atelectatic lung.
