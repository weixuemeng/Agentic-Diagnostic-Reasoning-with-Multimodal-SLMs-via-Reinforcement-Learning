                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Brain tumor with spiking fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  Again there is an area of increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region with poor definition of the descending aorta.  Although
 this could merely reflect atelectasis, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
