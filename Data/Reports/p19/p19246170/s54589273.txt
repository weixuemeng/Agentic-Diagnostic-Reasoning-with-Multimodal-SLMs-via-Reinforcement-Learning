 Comparison to ___.  The lung volumes are stable.  The nodularity
 previously seen in the right upper lobe is no longer visible.  However, there
 is an indistinct increase in radiodensity at the level of the right upper lobe
 and, to a minor extent, also in the left lower lobe.  If the clinical
 presentation is suggestive of pneumonia, a CT should be performed to further
 evaluate potential lung parenchymal disease, given the risks situation of the
 patient.  Borderline size of the heart.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
