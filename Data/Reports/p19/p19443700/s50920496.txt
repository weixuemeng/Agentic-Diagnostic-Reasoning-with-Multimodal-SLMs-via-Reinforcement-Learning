                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The lung
 volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Linear bibasilar
 opacities are most compatible with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
