                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of the SCC of the lungs, head, neck, and esophagus, now
 status post CyberKnife radiation, wedge resection, and neoesophagus. 
 Presenting with worsening dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs and CTA chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared with the prior examination dated ___, there has been
 no significant interval change.  Redemonstrated are spiculated pulmonary
 nodules within the right upper lobe and left lower lobe with associated
 fiducial markers, without definitive change.  The patient is status post
 esophagectomy and a neoesophagus is noted. Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles may represent a small bilateral effusions, larger on the
 left.  Chronic prominent interstitial markings within the right lower lobe are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema identified. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Multiple retrocardiac surgical clips are
 again seen in unchanged position.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definitive evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Chronic, moderate cardiomegaly. 
 
 3.  Small left greater than right bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 4.  Stable, bilateral pulmonary nodules and extensive chronic postoperative
 changes, as above.
