                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with past medical history of lung malignancy with
 cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are bilateral lung
 nodules with fiducial markers, not definitely changed.  Associated distortion
 is seen in the right paramediastinal region is unchanged.  Right basilar
 heterogeneous opacity has not significantly changed since the prior exams. 
 Chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to underlying
 effusion or scarring.  Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear.  Biapical right
 greater than left pleural thickening is again seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged.  Surgical clips seen in the retrocardiac region and
 along the mediastinum.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic changes as
 above, noting that right basilar opacity could potentially be infectious,
 although it is unchanged from prior.
