 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of head and neck cancer treated for pneumonia,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Left and right fiducial markers with surrounding parenchymal
 consolidations.  Known mild peribronchial parenchymal opacities at the right
 lung base that have slightly decreased in the interval.  Pleural adhesions at
 the left lung bases.  Bilateral slightly asymmetrical apical thickening that
 is unchanged as compared to the prior examination.  The upper contour of the
 fifth right rib is irregular and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
