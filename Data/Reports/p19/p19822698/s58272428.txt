 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with history of head and neck cancer, now with
 increasing shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through most
 recent chest radiograph ___, read in conjunction with chest CT ___.
 
 The patient has had esophagectomy and the neoesophagus is chronically
 distended with retained food.  Two nodular sites of prior CyberKnife treatment
 are denoted by fiducial markers, one in the right upper lobe, the other in the
 left lower.  These lesions are relatively stable since ___.  A region
 of heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lung is considerably more
 extensive now than it was in ___.  This is either recurrent or persistent
 infection, presumably due to aspiration, or alternatively a rapidly aggressive
 alveolar form of adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic, and emphysema is severe.  Small left pleural effusion is stable.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally large, but unchanged.
