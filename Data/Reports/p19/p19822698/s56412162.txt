                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of right upper lobe, left upper lobe and left lower lobe
 neoplasm and lobectomy, status post gastric pull-through, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the
 mediastinum after gastric pull-through is almost unchanged.  Large right
 perihilar mass with a fiducial seed is overall unchanged in size and
 appearance.  A second mass, also containing a fiducial marker, located in the
 lateral aspects of the left lung, has substantially increased in size and
 radiodensity.  This might reflect a true increase or an effect of therapy. 
 Hyperlucency of the right lung apex suggests the presence of substantial
 emphysema.  Post-operative right rib defect at the level of the sixth rib. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta that is unchanged. 
 The lateral radiograph provides no safe evidence for the presence of pleural
 effusions.
