                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and fever. Review of OMR indicates a
 history of HIV.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded, with a hazy opacity in the right lung base with mild peribronchial
 cuffing.  The heart is top normal in size.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  There is no effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild pulmonary edema. However, please
 note that the differential could include other causes of increased interstial
 markings, including infectious infiltrates.
