                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chain sutures in the lungs bilaterally are re- demonstrated compatible with
 prior wedge resections. Panlobular and centrilobular emphysema is re-
 demonstrated with chronic interstitial and nodular abnormality, most
 pronounced in the upper lobes, likely reflecting areas of bronchiectasis,
 scarring, and known pulmonary nodules better assessed on the previous CT. The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart size within
 normal limits.  Rightward shift of mediastinal structures is unchanged. Spiral
 tacks are seen along the left hemidiaphragm compatible with prior
 diaphragmatic hernia repair, and the left hemidiaphragm remains elevated. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multiple remote left-sided rib fractures are
 re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Centrilobular and panlobular emphysema with chronic interstitial abnormality
 and nodules, as seen on the previous exams. Evidence of prior left
 diaphragmatic hernia repair and remote left-sided rib fractures.  No
 substantial interval change from the previous exams.
