                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to the prior
 examination.  Lungs are markedly hyperinflated suggestive of underlying
 emphysema. Relative lucency at the right base corresponds to bullous changes
 on a CT dated ___.  Since the prior study, there is coarsening of the
 interstitium with associated parenchymal distortion and scarring, particularly
 in the upper lungs.  There are scattered nodular opacities, some of which are
 stable, but some of which have developed, especially a 1cm irregular opacity
 at the left apex.  Further imaging evaluation with chest CT is recommended at
 this time.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Healed left sided rib
 fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased upper lobe predominant interstitial abnormality and bilateral
 nodular opacities.  Further imaging evaluation with dedicated chest CT is
 recommended at this time.
