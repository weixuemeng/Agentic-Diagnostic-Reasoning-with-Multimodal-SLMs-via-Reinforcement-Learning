                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with mild
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension. Lungs remain hyperinflated with bullous emphysematous changes
 most pronounced at the lung bases compatible with panlobular emphysema.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 Multiple spiral tacks are seen along the left diaphragm contour with chronic
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compatible with previous diaphragmatic
 hernia repair. Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Panlobular emphysema and evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
