                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with malaise, elevated WBC  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Mildly elevated left
 hemidiaphragm again noted with underlying mesh coils.  Numerous left rib cage
 deformities are again noted.  Severe emphysema and hyperinflation again noted.
 Subtle micronodular opacities in the right mid lung raise potential concern
 for atypical infection versus aspiration.  A similar cluster of micronodular
 opacity is noted in the left lower lung.
 Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony
 structures are intact.  Suture is seen projecting over the right apex likely
 reflecting an old resection site.  No acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle nodular opacities in the right mid lung and left lower lung raise
 concern for atypical infection versus chronic aspiration.  Severe background
 emphysema.
