                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and mucous
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures again noted.  There is similar
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with mesh material projecting over the
 diaphragmatic contour.  Post thoracotomy changes are again noted on the left
 with chain sutures seen in both lung apices.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Bullous emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated, with the
 largest bulla seen at in the right lung base.  Unchanged linear opacities in
 both upper lobes likely reflect areas of scarring.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No interval change from the previous exam without new acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
