                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever post-breast reduction in ___ for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the later radiograph is severely limited by patient's
 arm position.  Within this limitation, the cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified. Substantially assymetrically increased soft tissue
 opacification on the left with suggestion of subcutaneous gas and possible air
 fluid level on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Assymetry of breast soft tissue
 with possible subcutaneous gas and air fluid level noted on lateral view may
 relate to recent surgery.  Please correlate with patient symptom and surgical
 history.
