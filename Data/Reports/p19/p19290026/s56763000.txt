 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of positive PPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 minimally decreased and the size of the cardiac silhouette has slightly
 increased.  The heart, however, is still within normal ranges.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The lungs are unremarkable, there is no
 evidence for parenchymal opacities and no evidence for non-recent or recent
 tuberculosis infection.
