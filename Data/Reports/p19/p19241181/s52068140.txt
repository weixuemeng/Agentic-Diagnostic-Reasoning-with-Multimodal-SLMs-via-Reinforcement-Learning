 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:23 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is interval
  increase of right basilar opacity concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  There
  are probable bilateral small pleural effusions.  Radiopaque material in the
  left upper quadrant could relate to recently ingested contrast from video
  swallow performed on ___.  However clinical correlation is
  recommended.
  
  Findings discussed with ___ ___ by ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 8:20 p.m., 3 minutes after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with vocal cord paralysis, neck mass status
 post unsuccessful nasogastric tube placement with lots of coughing.  Evaluate
 for aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portalbe AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line remains unchanged in position. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is stable
 retrocardiac consolidation with an associated effusion most likely
 representing partial lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  There is increasing opacification at the right base,
 which could reflect worsening atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia
 should also be considered in this location as well.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Radiopaque material in the left upper quadrant
 likely related to ingested contrast for a recent video swallow.  Old healed
 left-sided lower rib fractures.  No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
