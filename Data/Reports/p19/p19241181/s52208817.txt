  Interval removal of endotracheal tube and enteric catheter.  Right-sided
  central venous catheter stable in position.  Comparative evaluation is limited
  due to patient rotation.  Within this limitation there appears to be
  relatively stable left lower lung opacification likely representing
  combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Right lower lung opacification is
  not significantly changed.  No pneumothorax present.  Unchanged
  cardiomediastinal contours.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic cancer, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been interval
 removal of an endotracheal tube and an enteric catheter.  Right-sided central
 venous catheter is stable in position.  Comparative evaluation is limited due
 to patient's rotation.  Relatively stable left lower lobe opacity, likely
 representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Right lower lobe
 opacity is not significantly changed as compared to the previous radiograph,
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Unchanged cardiomediastinal contours.
