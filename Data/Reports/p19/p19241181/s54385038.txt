                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Altered mental status, respiratory distress.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed two hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine frontal view of the chest.  The endotracheal tube
 is 5.5 cm above the carina.  An upper enteric tube ends in the stomach, with
 its most proximal side port located below the gastroesophageal junction.  A
 new right internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava. 
 Consolidation in the right lower lobe is unchanged and remains concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart size is normal.  There are old right rib fractures. The aorta is
 tortuous.  Prominence of the left hilum persists and corresponds to a
 lymphadenopathy seen on the chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A new right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  The
 endotracheal tube now ends 5.5 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, unchanged
 appearance of the thorax.
