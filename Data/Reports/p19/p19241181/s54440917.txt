 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  AMS and hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid
 SVC.  NG tube is coiled in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Allowing the differences in
 positioning of the patient, moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
 with associated adjacent atelectasis.  Atelectasis are left greater than
 right.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Shifting of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette towards the left suggests collapse of the left lower lobe.
