                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperinflated, but
 clear, lungs.  The cardiac size is top normal.  The thoracic aorta is
 unfolded. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small
 amount of scarring rather than pleural effusion.  Lobulation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is present.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
