                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by bilateral perihilar and basilar hazy opacities as well as more
 confluent opacification at the right base. Small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar and bibasilar opacities are most suggestive of pulmonary edema in
 the setting of pulmonary vascular congestion and pleural effusions. However,
 followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to ensure resolution and to
 exclude coexisting pneumonia at the right lung base.
