                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration  // assess for dobhoff placement
 2 stage xray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 sequential AP views of the chest taken 3 minutes apart.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the prior enteric tube with attempted
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube, with the first image showing the Dobbhoff tube
 terminating in the right lower lobe bronchus, and the second showing the
 Dobbhoff tube in the left main bronchus. A right PICC line is present with tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  The heart is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Biapical pleural scarring is again noted. Please note that the
 right costophrenic angle is not captured on this exam. Lung volumes are low,
 and there is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Malpositioned Dobbhoff tube into the bronchial tree. At the time of this
 report, subsequent imaging shows removal of malpositioned Dobbhoff.
