                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right upper lobectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Interstitial opacities in the right lung have minimally increased, likely due
 to edema.  In the right upper hemithorax several air-fluid levels are more
 conspicuous than in prior studies ..  Right perihilar opacity is grossly
 unchanged, allowing the difference in position of the patient.  The left lung
 is clear.  The right chest tube remains in unchanged position.  Right chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
