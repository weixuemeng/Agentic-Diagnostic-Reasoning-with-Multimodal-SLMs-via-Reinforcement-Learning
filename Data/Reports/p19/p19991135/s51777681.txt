                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain, redness, and slight swelling at right chest surgical site
 for the past two days.  Patient has undergone a prior right VATS, converted to
 a thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy for a pulmonary nodule which was
 thought to be malignant but pathology revealed only a granulomatous
 inflammatory process.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is
 volume loss on the right with associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with the provided history of prior right upper lobectomy.  Pleural
 densities along the right upper lateral chest wall are not significantly
 changed.  Similarly, opacity at the right apex along the superior mediastinum
 is not significantly changed, possibly loculated fluid in the pleural space. 
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  There is no left
 pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  There is evidence of
 prior right thoracotomy, involving the right posterior sixth rib.  Cervical
 fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change.
 2.  Post-surgical changes on the right, as described above.
