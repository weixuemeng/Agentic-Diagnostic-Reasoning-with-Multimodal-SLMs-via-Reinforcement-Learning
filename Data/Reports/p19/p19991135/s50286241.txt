                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of 40-pack-year smoking
 and increased right upper lobe nodule with FDG avidity on PET-CT, now status
 post right VATS converted to thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy, evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The
 previously described remaining pleural densities along the upper right lateral
 chest wall in the shoulder area show diminished thickness of the pleural
 density surrounding the operative area.  Postoperative localized apical
 pneumothorax has diminished further and is now barely 1 cm wide, also showing
 increasing pleural scar formation.  No new abnormalities are seen.  The left
 hemithorax is unchanged, though no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of postoperative healing, status post right upper
 lobectomy accomplished via VATS extended to thoracotomy intervention.
