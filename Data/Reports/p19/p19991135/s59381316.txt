                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right VATS of right upper lobe,
 chest tube clamped for six hours, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained
 four hours earlier during the same day.  The previously described right-sided
 chest tube remains in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax has developed and
 there is no evidence of significantly increased pleural densities during this
 interval.  The right-sided chest wall emphysema described earlier has
 regressed.  No new abnormalities are seen.  Left-sided hemithorax is
 unremarkable.
