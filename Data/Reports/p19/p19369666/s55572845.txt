                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Bilateral diffuse interstitial
 thickenings are compatible with pulmonary edema.  There is no focal opacity. 
 The heart is enlarged, mostly from left atrial and left ventricle contribution
 with splaying of the carina, left atrial appemndage prominence and
 verticalization of the long cardiac axis.  There is a large hiatal hernia and
 a tortuous aorta which account for a rounded retrocardiac opacity in the
 lateral view. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening may be due to interstitial
 pulmonary edema in the setting of enlargement of the left cardiac chambers or
 may be secondary to pulmonary emphysema.
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.
