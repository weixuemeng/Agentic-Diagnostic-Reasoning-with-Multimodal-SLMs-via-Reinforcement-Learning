 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Reduction of internal hernia, shortness of breath, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There are signs of atelectasis at both lung bases.  Coexisting
 early pneumonia, however, cannot be excluded.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The
 monitoring and support devices are constant.
