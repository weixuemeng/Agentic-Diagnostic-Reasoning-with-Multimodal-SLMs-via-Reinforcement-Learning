                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with resolving pulmonary edema s/p kidney
 transplant  // Residual pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Left IJ CV catheter tip terminates in
 the low SVC. There has been interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric
 tube. Diffuse pulmonary opacities are slightly improved and likely represent
 edema though a superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Pleural
 effusions are likely small. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
 pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact. Skin ___ project over the mid
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Persistent pulmonary
 opacities appear slightly improved though raise concern for persistent edema
 with possible superimposed pneumonia.
