                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation on
 anticoagulation, now recently postoperative from orthopedic surgery.  Patient
 with respiratory decompensation resulting in reintubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position, 2.9 cm above the level of the carina.  There are diffuse parenchymal
 opacities, with enlargement and indistinctness of the hila, findings
 suggestive of interval development of pulmonary edema.  Opacities are
 asymmetric, right greater than left, which may be related to patient's
 positioning.  An alternative explanation would be developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There are also bibasilar opacities which likely
 reflect a combination of atelectasis and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: New lung opacities, right greater than left.  Findings are likely
 due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, though pneumonia is possible.
