                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is enlarged, probably to a similar degree allowing for
 decrease in lung volumes.  On this study, the main pulmonary artery contour
 appears larger, which could be seen with fluid overload.  Multifocal opacities
 are seen in the context of a generalized moderate interstitial abnormality. 
 Findings suggest pulmonary edema.  Mild atelectasis is also suspected at  the
 posterior left lung base.  There are probably very small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.  Follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful, however, to reassess.
