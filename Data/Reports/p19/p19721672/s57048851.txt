 and left calcified pleural plaques located over the hemidiaphragms are from
 prior asbestos or talc pleuradesis.  A left pectoral bi-electrode pacer's
 leads end in the right atrium and right ventricular apex respectively.

 1.  Relatively unchanged extensive bilateral pneumonia.  
 
 2.  Colonic conduit from prior esophageal resection.
