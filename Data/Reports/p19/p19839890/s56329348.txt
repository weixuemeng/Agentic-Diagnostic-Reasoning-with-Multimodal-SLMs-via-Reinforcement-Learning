                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for new pulmonary nodules.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Multiple new rounded opacities are scattered throughout both
 lungs, the largest is located in the left lower lung.  The smaller ones are
 located in the right lung apex and left mid lung.  Given the clinical history
 of cancer and the rapid rate of growth, these lesions are consistent with
 metastatic disease.  Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is
 limited due to these lesions; however, both are relatively unchanged.  There
 is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No definite rib
 fracture. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral round opacities of varying sizes, consistent
 with metastatic disease.  No definite rib fracture.  If there is continued
 clinical concern for a rib fracture oblique views are recommended.
