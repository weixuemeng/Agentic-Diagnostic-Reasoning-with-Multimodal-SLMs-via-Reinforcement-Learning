                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  Streak of fibrosis is
 seen in the right apical region.  However, no evidence of acute pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
