                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the orogastric
 tube extends below the hemidiaphragm in the stomach.  The somewhat unusual
 course suggests that it has gone through a large hiatal hernia.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
