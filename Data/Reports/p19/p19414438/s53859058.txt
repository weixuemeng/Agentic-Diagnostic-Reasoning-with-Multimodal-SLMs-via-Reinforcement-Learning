 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with worsening shortness of breath, low oxygen
 saturation.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared with previous exam of

 lucency in the retrocardiac region is suggestive of possible hiatal hernia,
 similar to prior exam.
