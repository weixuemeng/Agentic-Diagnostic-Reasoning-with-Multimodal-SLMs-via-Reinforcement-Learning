                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from approximately 45 minutes earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Re-positioning of NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP of the chest provided.  There has been
 re-positioning of the nasogastric tube which resides in the expected position
 of the stomach.  This patient is known to have a hiatal hernia.  The
 endotracheal tube appears somewhat low in position, residing at the carina
 which likely is exaggerated due to the patient's chin positioned down.  Lung
 volumes remain low.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Re-positioning of NG tube with tip likely residing within the
 stomach in this patient with a known hiatal hernia.  Low-lying endotracheal
 tube.  Consider retraction by 1 to 2 cm for more optimal positioning.
