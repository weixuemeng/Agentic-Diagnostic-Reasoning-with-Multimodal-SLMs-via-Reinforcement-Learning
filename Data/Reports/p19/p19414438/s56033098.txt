                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with worsening tachypnea.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There are very low lung volumes which limits evaluation.  The left perihilar
 mass seen previously is not well seen on this study.  There is blunting of
 both CP angles, which may represent pleural fluid.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess due to the overlying gas within the fundus of the stomach
 and the low lung volumes.  There are no pneumothoraces.
