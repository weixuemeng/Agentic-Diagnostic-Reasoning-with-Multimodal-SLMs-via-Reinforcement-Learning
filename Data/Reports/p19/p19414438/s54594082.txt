                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged and a left-sided intrathoracic stomach is
 again demonstrated.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of
 the intrathoracic stomach.  2.8-cm left hilar mass containing calcifications
 is re- demonstrated, similar in size compared to the previous study .  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.  Additionally, a trace right pleural effusion may be present.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis, though
 infection is not excluded.  A trace right pleural effusion may also be
 present.
 
 2. No interval change in appearance of the left hilar mass.
