                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, cough.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes bilaterally are unchanged since ___.
 Markedly limited evaluation of lung bases with bilateral basilar heterogeneous
 opacities representing atelectasis or possible pneumonia.  No new focal
 opacity.   Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the elevated diaphragms.  Lung
 apices are obscured by patient's chin positioning limiting assessment for
 apical pneumothorax. Moderate degenerative disease of the left shoulder.
 Additional visualized bones are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged low lung volumes.
 2.  Markedly limited evaluation of lung bases with bilateral basilar opacities
 is likely basilar atelectasis however may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
