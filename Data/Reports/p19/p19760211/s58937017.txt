                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with MVC  // eval for structural process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Lungs are clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bones are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
