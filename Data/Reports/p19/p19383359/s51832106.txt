 opacity convincing for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Clips project
 over the mid upper abdomen. Dilated loops of small bowel are noted projecting
 over the upper quadrant. No air to the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
