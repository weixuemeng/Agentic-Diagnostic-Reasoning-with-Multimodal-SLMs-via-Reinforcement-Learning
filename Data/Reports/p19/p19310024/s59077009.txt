                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p MV repair  // eval for effusion or
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with associated compressive
 atelectasis are essentially unchanged.  Opacity projecting over the right apex
 was not clearly seen on prior radiographs.  There is no widening of the
 paratracheal stripe to suggest mediastinal hematoma.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  A small left apical pneumothorax is new.  A right IJ central venous
 catheter is unchanged in position, terminating near the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Visualized cardiomediastinal
 hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  A mitral valve replacement is noted. 
 Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New small left apical pneumothorax.
 2. Right apical opacity raises the possibility of pleural fluid or blood.
 3. Unchanged moderate left and small right pleural effusions with associated
 compressive atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, P.A. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:49 PM, approximately 120
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
