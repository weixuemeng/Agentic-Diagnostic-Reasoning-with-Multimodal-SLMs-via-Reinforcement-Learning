                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB and increasing requirement  // Please
 evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection, erect positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___ at 15:36.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen a right-sided dialysis catheter whose distal tip projects
 over the lower SVC versus cavoatrial junction.  This is likely in unchanged
 position and the appearance of a more distal location of the tip likely
 reflects decreased lung volumes in comparison to prior radiograph.  There has
 been interval removal of endotracheal tube, as well as removal of previously
 seen NG tube.
 
 The cardio mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 There has been interval increase in opacification of the lower portion of the
 right upper lobe which may represent developing pulmonary edema, infection, or
 atelectasis. There is again redemonstrated a loculated left pleural effusion
 without significant interval change. Also again seen is a small right sided
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased opacification of the lower portion of the right upper lobe which
 may represent developing pulmonary edema, infection, or atelectasis.
 2.  Stable appearance of left loculated pleural effusion and small right
 pleural effusion.
