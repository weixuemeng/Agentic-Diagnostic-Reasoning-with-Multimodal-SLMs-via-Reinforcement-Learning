                                 FINAL REPORT
 SERIES OF CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A series of portable radiographs were obtained to document
 placement of a feeding tube.  The third and final radiograph of the series
 demonstrates the tip of the nasogastric tube in the proximal stomach, but side
 port is above the gastroesophageal junction location.  Tip of endotracheal
 tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina, and a dialysis catheter terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema. 
 Widespread calcifications in the mid and lower portions of the chest are
 probably predominantly pleural in location, suggesting prior asbestos
 exposure.  Moderate loculated left and small loculated right pleural effusions
 are present with or without component of pleural thickening.  Associated
 bibasilar lung opacities (left greater than right), may reflect atelectasis
 and/or infectious consolidation.  Note is made of apparent wall thickening of
 the right main bronchus, difficult to assess radiographically.
