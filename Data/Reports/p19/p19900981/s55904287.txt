                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with elevated wbc. fever  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is faint retrocardiac opacity focally silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 No acute osseous abnormalities.  Increased sclerosis at the bilateral humeral
 heads is likely due to avascular necrosis.  H-shaped vertebral bodies are
 again noted.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very slight retrocardiac opacity which is potentially atelectasis.  If
 persistent clinical concern, consider PA and lateral for further
 characterization.
