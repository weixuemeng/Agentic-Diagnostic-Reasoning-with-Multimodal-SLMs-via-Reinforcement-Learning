                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation, secretions increased  //
 evidence of pna, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, tip approximately 4.3 cm above the carina, and an NG
 tube, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Mild upper zone redistribution
 is similar to the prior study. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is more pronounced,
 with new obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. Otherwise, no focal
 infiltrate. No gross effusion.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm and increased retrocardiac
 opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Mild upper zone redistribution, similar to prior.
