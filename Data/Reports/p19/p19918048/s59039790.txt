 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:45 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, I
 doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is patchy opacity at the right
 and left bases.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect
 a small pleural effusion.  Note is made of a top-normal caliber loop of small
 bowel in the left upper quadrant.
