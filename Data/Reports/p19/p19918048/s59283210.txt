                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, fever after cystectomy and neobladder.  Rule
 out pneumonia.
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Heart size is borderline with a left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  The hila are probably slightly prominent, not fully assessed due to
 overlying structures.  There is no CHF or gross effusion.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle cannot be
 excluded.  If clinical suspicion for a pulmonary infiltrate remains high, then
 lateral view may help for further assessment.
