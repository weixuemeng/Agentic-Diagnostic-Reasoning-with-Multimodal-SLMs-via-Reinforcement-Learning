                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 5:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with SBO, NG tube now in place.  Evaluate
 for location.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film, ___ at 5:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting
 over the expected location of the stomach.  A right subclavian PICC line
 remains in place with its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged.  Slight interval
 improvement in lung volumes with improved aeration at low lung bases.  Focal
 airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Minimal blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle which could reflect a tiny pleural effusion
 versus pleural thickening.
