 HISTORY:  Bladder cancer resection, to assess for metastatic disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again mild
 hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease. 
 However, there is no evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.  Specifically, no pulmonary or skeletal metastases identified.
