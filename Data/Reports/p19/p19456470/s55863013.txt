                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Chest, portable.  There is subtle opacity in the left lower lung. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle opacity in the left lower lung may represent atelectasis,
 but early pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.  Consider obtaining lateral film
 and/or close interval followup if there is high clinical suspicion for
 pulmonary infection.
