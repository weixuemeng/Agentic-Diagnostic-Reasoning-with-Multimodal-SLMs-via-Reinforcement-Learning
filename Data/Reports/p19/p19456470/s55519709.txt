                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with abnormality
 demonstrated on recent chest radiograph (___).
 
 The PA and lateral upright chest radiographs demonstrate stable appearance of
 the heart and mediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are essentially clear except
 for linear atelectasis in the left mid lower lung.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, no new abnormalities demonstrated as compared
 to prior chest radiograph and prior chest CT.  The cystic structure in the
 left lower lobe is better appreciated on the lateral view.
