                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  Heart
 size is normal.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema is present, as well as a
 large thin-walled cystic structure within the left retrocardiac region, which
 may be due to a bulla or pneumatocele.  This was previously imaged on
 abdominal CT of ___ and appears relatively similar allowing for
 technical differences.  Worsening heterogeneous opacities are present in the
 right lower lobe, and there are also poorly defined nodular opacities in the
 right lung apex.  A focal patchy opacity is also present in the left
 retrocardiac area.  These findings are nonspecific, but could reflect evolving
 multifocal pneumonia or multifocal aspiration in the appropriate clinical
 setting. Linear atelectasis is present in both the left mid and right lower
 lung. Additional right lower lung septal lines may due to asymmetrical edema
 in the setting of small right pleural effusion and peribronchial cuffing.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Multifocal lung opacities, possibly due to multifocal aspiration and mild
 edema.  When the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs are recommended for more complete evaluation of the chest,
 especially to reevaluate nodular opacities in the right apex.
