                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration versus community-acquired pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is redemonstration of right lung base
 consolidation with air bronchograms slightly progressed compared to prior
 study.  Retrocardiac opacities have improved and are likely atelectatic. 
 Small right effusion is unchanged.  There is redemonstration of significant
 emphysema, particularly with increased biapical lucency.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening of right base consolidation worrisome for pneumonia or
 aspiration with associated small right effusion.
