                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up right lower lobe infiltrate.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Patchy airspace opacities within the right middle and lower lobe are

 bilateral streaky opacities within the mid lungs likely reflect multifocal
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No acute bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent right middle and lower lobe patchy airspace consolidations, which
 may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
