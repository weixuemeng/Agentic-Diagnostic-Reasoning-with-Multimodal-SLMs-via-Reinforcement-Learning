                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset vent requirement  // evaluation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there are new hazy opacities
 in the mid and lower right lung.  Extensive parenchymal and pleural changes in
 the left hemithorax are grossly unchanged with at least a moderate, loculated,
 left apical pleural effusion and a moderate, dependent, left pleural effusion.
 The visualized cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New hazy opacities in the lateral mid and lower right lung likely reflect an
 underlying infectious process.
