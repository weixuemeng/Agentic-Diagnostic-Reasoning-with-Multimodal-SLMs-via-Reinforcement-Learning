                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, variceal bleeding,
 hepatic encephalopathy s/p TIPS, presenting after fall with SDH and SAH,
 stable on serial head CT, still minimally responsive off sedation.  // Please
 evaluate lungs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, new  airspace opacification in
 the right upper lobe, and a confluent area of airspace opacification in the
 right infrahilar region are concerning for evolving infectious pneumonia;
 aspiration and hemorrhage are additional considerations in the appropriate
 clinical settings.  Within the left hemi thorax, a large partially loculated
 pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size, and a rounded area of
 atelectasis in the left mid and lower lung persists.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for tip of endotracheal tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina,
 with neck in a flexed position.
