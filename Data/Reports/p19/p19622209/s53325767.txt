                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Choking episode.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is vague
 opacity in the lingula but probably due to minor atelectasis, airway
 inflammation or both.  Suspicion for a significant aspiration event is low,
 although some degree of aspiration is difficult to exclude as an explanation
 for this appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague streaky opacity at the left lung base.
