                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R TKA, continues to require O2 post-op,
 evaluate for infectious process  // evaluate for infectious process, ?PNA    
 evaluate for infectious process, ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  The left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen and there is blunting of
 the costophrenic angle, consistent with postoperative volume loss in the lower
 lobe and pleural effusion.
 There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure, though some of this may merely reflect the supine
 portable technique.  No definite acute focal pneumonia, though this is
 difficult to exclude unequivocally in the absence of a lateral view.
