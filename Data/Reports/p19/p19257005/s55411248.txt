                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left upper lobe pneumonia and small pulmonary
 nodules on CT.  Assess resolution of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The left upper lobe lesion seen on ___, corroborating with the ___ CT scan is smaller.  Nevertheless, I would repeat conventional chest
 radiograph in four weeks to make sure it has resolved, since on the CT scan,
 it had a distinctly nodular quality.  At that time, we can decide if the time
 table for repeat CT scanning needs to be accelerated.  Given the combination
 of central adenopathy, one dominant nodular lesion and smaller nodules leads
 me to ask if the patient may have acquired coccidioidomycosis.
 
 There are no other lung findings today, no pleural effusion and no indication
 that central adenopathy has increased.  Heart size is normal.
