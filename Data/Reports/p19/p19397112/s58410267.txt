                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p fall with sub-galeal SDH, C1/dens fracture with
 associated hematoma, and soft tissue density at c6/c7 compressing spinal cord
 thought to be a spinal hematoma per spine and neurogenic shock with difficulty
 with oxygenation  // interval change    interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there
 is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Hazy opacification at the
 bases silhouetting the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering pleural
 effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
