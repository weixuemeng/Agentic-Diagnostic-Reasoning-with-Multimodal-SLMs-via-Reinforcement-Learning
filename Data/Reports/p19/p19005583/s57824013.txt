                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob and rib pain  // pna?      pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  Moderate overinflation on the lateral radiograph. 
 In the interval, there are newly occurred both alveolar and interstitial
 opacities in the right lung apex, the right middle lobe and the left perihilar
 lung regions.  Multifocal pneumonia is the most likely differential diagnosis.
 However, given the slightly rounded appearance of a component of the right
 upper lobe opacity, complete resolution must be confirmed radiographically, to
 exclude the presence of a neoplasm.
 No cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.
