                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
