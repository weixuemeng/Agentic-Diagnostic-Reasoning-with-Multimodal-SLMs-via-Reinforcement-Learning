 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. 
 Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Marked improved aeration at both lung bases with
 resolution of bibasilar atelectasis.  No visible pneumothorax.  No definite
 pleural effusion, but costophrenic angles have been excluded from the
 radiograph, limiting assessment for small effusions.
