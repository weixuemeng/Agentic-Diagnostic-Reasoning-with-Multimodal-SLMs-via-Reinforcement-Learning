                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hip fracture, ? OG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:38 p.m.
 
 Again seen is the ET tube in satisfactory position, approximately 4.4 cm above
 the carina.  An OG-type tube is present.  The tip is not optimally visualized.
 It lies in the region of, but not clearly distal to, the EG junction.  
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged, but grossly unchanged.  Increased right paratracheal soft tissues
 and prominence of the hila again noted.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 with mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial
 edema.  No gross effusion.  A small left effusion is likely present.  
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the CHF findings are similar but slightly
 more prominent.  There is bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation (current
 film obtained erect).
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) OG near, but not clearly distal, to the GE junction.
 2) CHF findings slightly worse.
 3) Bibasilar collpase and/or consolidation.
