                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  COPD, presenting with one week of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ are not currently available for
 review and likewise for radiographs from ___.  However, a chest CT
 from ___ is available and comparison can be made to the scout view.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size to mildly enlarged.
 The aorta is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  On the prior CT, there was a substantial hiatal hernia which is
 not well visualized on this examination.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are present and better seen on the lateral view.  The lungs are hyperinflated.
 Fissures are minimally thickened, which may suggest slight fluid overload. 
 However, the lungs appear clear.  Small anterior osteophytes are noted
 throughout the visualized thoracolumbar spine.  Leftward convex curvature
 along the upper lumbar spine is probably similar and associated with
 compression deformity of an upper lumbar vertebral body that may be similar,
 although not optimally characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly thickened fissures and small pleural effusions, which
 may suggest mild congestion or fluid overload; otherwise unremarkable.
