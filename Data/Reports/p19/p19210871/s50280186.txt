                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new dypsnea  // ?Infiltrate, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside CT of the chest performed by ___ on ___.  No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs demonstrate diffuse
 innumerable rounded lesions many of which are calcified in a perihilar
 distribution greater on the left than the right consistent with patient's
 history of Cowden disease with numerous pulmonary hamartomas. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is essentially
 normal. Evaluation of the hilar in cardiomediastinal contours is limited due
 to diffuse pulmonary lesions but appears within normal limits. There is
 calcification of the aortic knob. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable pulmonary lesions many of which are calcified and consistent with
 a hamartomas related to the patient's known Cowden disease. Superimposed
 infection is difficult to exclude in this setting, especially without prior
 chest radiographs available for comparison.
