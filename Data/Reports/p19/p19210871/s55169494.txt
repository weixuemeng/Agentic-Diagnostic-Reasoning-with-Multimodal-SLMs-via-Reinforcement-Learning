                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, history of Cowden disease
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and multiple prior chest
 radiographs ranging from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left upper extremity PICC line
 is seen with its tip terminating in the low SVC. Bilateral pulmonary
 opacities, many containing calcification, are overall unchanged in this
 patient with known Cowdens disease, these represent numerous pulmonary
 hamartomas.  Given the extensive background opacity, difficult to exclude a
 superimposed subtle pneumonia though none is clearly identified. No large
 effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size appears grossly stable. Mediastinal
 contour is similarly unchanged. No acute bony abnormality. No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line appears in appropriate position. Extensive pulmonary opacities
 consistent with known Cowdens disease representing pulmonary hamartomas. No
 definite signs of superimposed pneumonia.
