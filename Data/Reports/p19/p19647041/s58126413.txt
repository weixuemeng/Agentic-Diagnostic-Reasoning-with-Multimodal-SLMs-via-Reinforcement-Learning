  increasing left lower opacification and increased right lower lung
  opacification. given rapidity of development this likely represents a
  combination of atelectasis/ re-expansions edema and possibly re-accumulation
  of pleural fluid.  Less likely consideration is given to aspiration. ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent thoracocentesis
 now hypoxemic.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 5:00 p.m.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Right Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  There is substantial interval progression of left lung
 consolidation that given the rapidity of progression might represent a
 combination of atelectasis or reexpansion pulmonary edema and potentially
 reaccumulation at least in part of pleural fluid.  Hemorrhage is less likely. 
 Aspiration cannot be excluded, but should be clinically confirmed.  Right
 basal opacity is unchanged.  There is no interval development of pneumothorax.
