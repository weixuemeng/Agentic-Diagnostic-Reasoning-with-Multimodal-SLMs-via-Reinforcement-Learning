 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:07 PM
  Slight decrease in size of a now small left pleural effusion compared to the
  most recent study from ___.  No pneumothorax.  New small caliber
  pleural catheter projects over the lateral left lung base.  Increasing right
  lower lung heterogeneous opacities could be atelectasis given the lower lung
  volumes on today's study, although infection in this region is not excluded;
  clinical correlation recommended.  Compressive atelectasis at the left lung
  base is decreased.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
  19:05 via telephone on the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, presents
 with pleural effusion status post thoracentesis with a drain in the left
 question of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath which terminates in the low SVC.
 The lung volumes are low. There has been an interval increase in the moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion with an increase in mild adjacent atelectasis. 
 There has been a slight decrease in the size of a now small to moderate left
 pleural effusion with a new small caliber pleural catheter projecting over the
 left lung base. There has also been interval improvement of the left base
 compressive atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in the left-sided small to moderate pleural effusion
 with a new pleural catheter projecting over the lateral left lung base.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Interval increase in the moderate right-sided pleural effusion and mild
 adjacent atelectasis.
