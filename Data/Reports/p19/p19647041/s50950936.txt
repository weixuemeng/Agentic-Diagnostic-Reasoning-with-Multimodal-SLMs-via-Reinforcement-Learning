 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place.  Interval removal of the left
 basilar pigtail catheter where there is residual patchy left basilar opacity
 which may reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No large left effusion is seen.  There is a slightly larger right
 pleural effusion with associated right basilar opacity suggestive of
 compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Gaseous
 distention of the stomach with some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which
 is unchanged.
