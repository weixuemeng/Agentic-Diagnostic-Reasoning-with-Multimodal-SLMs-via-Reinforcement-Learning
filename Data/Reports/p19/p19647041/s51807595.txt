                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate an increase in large
 left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  In addition, there is
 now obscuration of the right heart border.  This could be due to atelectasis
 versus pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  There may be a small
 right-sided pleural effusion as well.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in
 the right atrium, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarging left-sided pleural effusion with compressive
 atelectasis.  In addition, right-sided opacities, atelectasis versus pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting.
