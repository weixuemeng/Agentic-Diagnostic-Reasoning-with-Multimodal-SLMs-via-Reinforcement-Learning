                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metastatic cancer, lower extremity
 edema, evaluate for pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  There is a sizeable left-sided pleural effusion that
 obliterates the diaphragmatic contour and the lateral portion of the heart
 shadow.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed, but is probably within
 normal limits as there is no evidence of pulmonary congestion.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath system introduced via the right internal jugular vein approach is
 seen to terminate in the lower third of the SVC close to the expected entrance
 into the right atrium.  No pneumothorax can be identified.  There is evidence
 of bilateral pleural effusion, more so on the left than the right, where the
 effusion just blunts mildly the right lateral and right posterior pleural
 sinuses.  On the left side, the pleural effusion reaches along the left
 lateral wall up to the hilar level.  There is no pneumothorax on either side.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heart size cannot be assessed because of left-sided pleural
 densities obliterating the contours.  Small amount of pleural effusion also
 seen on right side.  Port-A-Cath system in place.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate
 gas distention of stomach.  No evidence of acute pulmonary vascular congestion
 or infiltrates or masses.  A page call was rendered on specific request for
 #___ at 5:20 p.m.  Contact with the house officer was established and the
 findings reported.  An estimate is that the left-sided pleural effusion may
 contain up to 500 mL.
