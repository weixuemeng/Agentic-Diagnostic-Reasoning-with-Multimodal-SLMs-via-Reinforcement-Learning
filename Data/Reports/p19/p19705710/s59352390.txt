                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low-grade temperature.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, similar
 compared to the previous exam.  There is no pulmonary edema, and the hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Patchy opacities are noted in both lung
 bases, which could reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection is not
 completely excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes of the left shoulder from noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be excluded.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
