                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Not feeling well, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes and the patient's chin
 and neck obscuring assessment of the right lung apex.  Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection
 cannot be completely excluded.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged with mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta again noted.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  A small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  Compression deformity of an upper lumbar vertebral
 body is unchanged.  Marked degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint
 are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Small left pleural effusion.
