                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cough and recently noted hyponatremia.  Right basilar
 decreased breath sounds.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  There is evidence
 of mild cardiomegaly with evidence of slight interval increase in the
 bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion.  The lung volumes are low, however,
 there appears to be a slight interval increase in linear bibasilar
 consolidations. The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a
 small left pleural effusion.  Visualized osseous structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New bibasilar linear opacities likely secondary to atelectasis; however, an
 acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  New small left pleural effusion.
