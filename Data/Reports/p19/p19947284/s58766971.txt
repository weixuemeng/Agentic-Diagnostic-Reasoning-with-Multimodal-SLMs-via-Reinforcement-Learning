                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with weakness, s/p seizure, known brain mets.  //
 r/o pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, increasing linear opacity at the left
 lung base is attributed to worsening atelectasis. Additionally, a nonspecific
 patchy opacity is developed at the right lung base, which could be due to
 focal aspiration, atelectasis, or developing pneumonia. No other relevant
 changes.
