                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with transplanted kidney
 and pancreas, and currently with fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.  Mediastinal calcified lymph nodes
 are unchanged.  Lungs are clear except for minimal opacity at the left lower
 lung adjacent to the left heart border that although might represent
 atelectasis, in relatively immunosuppressed patients might reflect developing
 infectious process.  In this specific case, correlation with chest CT is
 recommended.
