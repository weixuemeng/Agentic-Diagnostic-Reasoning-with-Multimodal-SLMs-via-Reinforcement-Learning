 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic melanoma and fever.  Concern for

 Small to moderate right pleural effusion is new, accompanying a large region

 heterogeneous opacification of the left suprahilar lung.  Although there could
 be a component of pulmonary edema, it is likely that there is bilateral
 pneumonia. A triangular opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe, new
 on ___ and still present is either infection or infarction. Fullness in
 both hila and the paratracheal regions of the mediastinum could be due to
 vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.  Calcification of
 granulomatous lymph nodes is documented on the ___ torso CT. Heart
 size is normal.
