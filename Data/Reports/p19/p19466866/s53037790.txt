                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, with bilateral
 pneumonia on chest x-ray on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest were obtained.  There is
 interval improvement in the right pleural effusion.  There is increased
 prominence of the hila.  Calcified lymph nodes are again seen in the perihilar
 regions.  Reticular thickening is increased in the right upper lobe suggestive
 of new interstitial edema.  There is increased perihilar opacitiy, which could
 represent vascular engorgement versus increased lymphadenopathy.  The
 subpleural opacity in the left upper lobe appears unchanged since prior
 imaging.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving right pleural effusion.  Worsening interstitial edema. 
 Increase in perihilar opacity likely due to vascular engorgement or lymph node
 enlargement.
 
 These findings were communicated to ___ at 3:15 p.m.
