                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic lesions in the brain,
 now presenting with worsening mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear.  A small triangular
 opacity along the peripheral left midlung is likely an artifact.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Air-filled
 colon is visualized below the left hemidiaphragm.  Probable cervical spinal
 fusion hardware is incompletely imaged in the region of the right neck.  Known
 subcentimeter pulmonary nodules are better characterized on prior CT
 examination.  There is a mild pectus excavatum deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Known subcentimeter pulmonary nodules
 not well visualized.
 2.  Triangular opacity in peripheral left midlung likely artifact. Consider
 repeat CXR to confirm. 
 3.  Stable pectus excavatum deformity.
