                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma to the lungs, liver, brain with leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Pneumoperitoneum is new compared to the prior exam.
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with multiple calcified lymph nodes again demonstrated within the
 mediastinum and hilar regions.  Numerous nodules are seen within both lungs, 1
 of which is cavitating and located within the left upper lobe, as demonstrated
 on the prior chest CT.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is noted. 
 Increased interstitial markings within the lung bases may reflect mild
 pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.  Cervical
 spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New pneumoperitoneum.  This finding was discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 at 21:00, ___ by phone.
 
 2. Diffuse pulmonary metastases, better assessed on prior chest CT.
 
 3. Increased interstitial markings at the lung bases likely suggestive of mild
 volume overload.
