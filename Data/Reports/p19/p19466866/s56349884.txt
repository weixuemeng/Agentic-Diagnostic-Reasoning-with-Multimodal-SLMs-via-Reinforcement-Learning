                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma to the lungs, liver, brain with mental status
 changes and right weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  Re- demonstrated are
 numerous calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours otherwise are unchanged.  Ill-defined nodular opacities are
 scattered within the left lung and are better demonstrated on the prior CT,
 not significantly changed in the interval.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Subtle increase in interstitial markings within the
 right lung base likely reflects lymphangitic spread of tumor, as demonstrated
 on the prior CT.  Previously seen compression deformity of the T11 vertebral
 body as well sclerotic lesion within T12 is better assessed on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change compared to the prior CT.  No new areas of
 opacification within the lungs.
