                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)

 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.

 edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Bronchovascular crowding likely
 accounts for central prominence of bronchovascular opacities. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited, negative.
