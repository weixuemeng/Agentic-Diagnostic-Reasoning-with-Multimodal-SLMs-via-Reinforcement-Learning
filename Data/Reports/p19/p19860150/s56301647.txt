 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.

 are unremarkable aside from streaky right suprahilar opacity most suggestive
 of minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear otherwise clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
