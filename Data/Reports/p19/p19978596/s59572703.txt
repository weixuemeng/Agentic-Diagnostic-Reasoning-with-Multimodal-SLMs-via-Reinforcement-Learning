                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  On the frontal view, there is very subtle opacity projecting over
 the region of the posterior right fifth rib but also overlaps with the scapula
 and anterior right second rib, maybe due to overlap of structures; however,
 this could be confirmed with oblique views to further assess.  No focal
 consolidation is seen elsewhere.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax in the
 region where the posterior fifth rib overlies with the anterior second rib and
 part of the scapula, may be due to overlapping structures.  However, this
 could be confirmed with oblique radiographs for further evaluation.  No focal
 consolidation seen elsewhere.
