                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with ARDS and liver disease status post OG tube
 placement.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen is extensive retrocardiac
 atelectasis and extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with air
 bronchograms.  Overall the appearance is not significantly changed from the
 prior study dated the same day.  An endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric feeding tube courses into the stomach with the last side
 port below the GE junction.  There is no pneumothorax. Calcified hilar lymph
 nodes are suggestive of prior granulomatous infection.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Enteric feeding tube courses into the stomach with the last side port below
 the GE junction.
