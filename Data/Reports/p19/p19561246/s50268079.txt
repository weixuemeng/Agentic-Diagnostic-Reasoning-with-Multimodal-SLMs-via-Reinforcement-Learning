                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:04
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cholangitis, sepsis, now tachypneic,
 question pneumonia, question ARDS.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 14:04 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is consolidative opacification in the right upper lobe and in the
 left lower lobe, which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.  In
 addition, there is likely airspace opacity within the right middle lobe as the
 right heart border is obscured.  Findings are felt to less likely represent
 pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation, however, is advised.  Radiopaque areas
 within the paratracheal soft tissues may represent calcified lymph nodes,
 although correlation with prior imaging would be helpful to better
 characterize this finding.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size given
 portable technique.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Possible layering effusions,
 left greater than right.
