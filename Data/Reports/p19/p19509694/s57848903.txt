                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with dyspnea and edema, evaluate for pneumonia
 or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is stable
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, compatible with mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly. Diffuse airspace and reticular interstitial opacities with a
 bilateral lower lobe predominance likely reflect chronic parenchymal
 inflammation, and were better characterized on prior chest CT from ___.  There is likely mild pulmonary edema superimposed. There is no evidence
 of focal lung consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable mild to moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Stable lower lobe predominant airspace and reticular interstitial
 opacities, possibly reflecting chronic lung disease.  No superimposed focal
 lung consolidation.
