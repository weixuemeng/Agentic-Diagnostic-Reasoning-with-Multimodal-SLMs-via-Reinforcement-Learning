                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  History of congestive heart failure and COPD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior examination, there is improved aeration
 bilaterally.  However, there remains some hazy opacification, greater at the
 bases, likely representing pulmonary edema and predominantly a mild to
 moderate interstitial abnormality.  No significant pleural effusion is
 present.  A small amount of pleural fluid is noted along the right major
 fissure.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate predominantly interstitial opacification, less
 severe than before, but suggesting persistent or recurrent pulmonary
 abnormality; although not specific, it could be seen with pulmonary edema
 among other causes.
