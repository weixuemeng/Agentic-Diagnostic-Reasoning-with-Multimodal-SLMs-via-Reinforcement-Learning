                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, decreased Lasix.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are stable, with widening
 of the right paratracheal stripe compatible with underlying mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  Diffuse interstitial markings are again seen with
 ground-glass opacities, perhaps minimally worse in the right lung base
 compared to the prior study.  These findings are compatible with chronic
 interstitial lung disease with a possible superimposed process.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse lung disease, with slight interval worsening of
 opacification in the right lung base.  These findings may reflect superimposed
 pulmonary edema on a background of chronic lung disease, though these findings
 could also be related to acute exacerbation of a recurrent pulmonary
 abnormality.
