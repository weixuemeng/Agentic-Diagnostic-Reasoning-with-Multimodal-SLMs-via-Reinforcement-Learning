                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure and COPD with acute dyspnea. 
 Evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are extensive heterogeneous opacities throughout the entire
 left lung and right lower lung.  The right mid and upper lung is essentially
 clear.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with sparing of the right
 mid/upper lung would be a somewhat unusual pattern for asymmetric pulmonary
 edema and it is thought to be concerning for a multifocal infectious process.
