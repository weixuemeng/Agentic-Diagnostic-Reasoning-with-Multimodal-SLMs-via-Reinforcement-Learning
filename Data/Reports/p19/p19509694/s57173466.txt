                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is
 mild to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Fissures are minimally thickened. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A diffuse moderate interstitial
 abnormality appears very similar to the prior studies.  No superimposed acute
 focal abnormality is identified.  There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality.  Findings could be seen
 with recurring or persistent pulmonary edema, which seems mostly likely,
 although an underlying interstitial abnormality could also be considered.
