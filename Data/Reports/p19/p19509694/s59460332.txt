                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of recent inhalation of crack cocaine,
 now presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Previously seen bilateral ground-glass
 opacities appear similar to prior and are consistent with patient's underlying
 chronic lung disease likely secondary to crack cocaine inhalation. There is no
 new confluent consolidation.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Pleural surfaces
 are clear without effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable baseline chronic lung disease without superimposed acute
 process.
