                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and multiple prior chest radiographs
 which include ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, unchanged. Prominent and asymmetric
 interstitial opacities appear improved from the most recent study but similar
 to ___.  A worsened appearance of the chest from ___ is
 worrisome for progressive and severe fibrosis, however, a component of acute
 reaction to drug use cannot be excluded.  The azygous vein is not enalarged
 and there are no pleural effusions to think this worsening is primarily
 related to volume overload.  The mediastinal and hilar structures are normal. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Prominent interstitial opacities which appear worse from ___ are thought to reflect a path to severe fibrosis, however, this
 could partially be explained by an acute reaction from recent drug use.  No
 convincing evidence for volume overload.
