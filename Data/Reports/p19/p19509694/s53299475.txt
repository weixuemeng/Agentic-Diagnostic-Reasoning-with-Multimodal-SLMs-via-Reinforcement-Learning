                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild prominence of the interstitial markings is again seen
 bilaterally, worst at the lung bases, likely due to known underlying chronic
 lung disease.  However, there may be a superimposed component of mild edema. 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  The mediastinal contours are also stable.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
