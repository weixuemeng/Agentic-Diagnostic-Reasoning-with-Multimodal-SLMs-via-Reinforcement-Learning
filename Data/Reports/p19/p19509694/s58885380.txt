                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart remains mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Redemonstrated are hazy opacifications bilaterally
 with a basilar predominance, which may slightly be worse in the interval.  No
 new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse hazy opacifications in the lungs, most pronounced at the
 lung bases, compatible with a chronic interstitial lung disease.  As findings
 may be slightly increased compared to the prior exam, a superimposed
 infectious process or exacerbation of the patient's underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded.
