                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and productive cough, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 The lungs are well expanded and show mild interstitial opacities.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Unchanged interstitial opacities were better characterized on recently
 performed chest CT.  It could be related to chronic interstitial lung disease
 with overlying edema.
