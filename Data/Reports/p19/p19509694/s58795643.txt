                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and nonproductive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 previously seen diffuse lung opacities have significantly decreased in the
 interval with possible residua seen in the bilateral lower lobes.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged.  Subtle peripheral right upper lobe linear opacity may
 relate to scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval decrease in previously seen bilateral
 pulmonary opacities with some opacity remaining in the bilateral lower lung
 fields.
