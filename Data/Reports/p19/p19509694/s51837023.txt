                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Crack cocaine lung injury, status post recent hospitalization,
 resolution of opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement
 with substantial decrease in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.
 Relatively large opacities, however, are still seen predominating in the lower
 lungs, right more than left.  There is unchanged borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  A mild fluid overload may not be excluded.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
