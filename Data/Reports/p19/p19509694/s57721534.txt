                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure.  Gastric tube placement
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___, ___, and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of ET tube
 with tip terminating 2.7 cm above the carina.  Compared to 1 day prior, there
 is massive progressive worsening of widespread pulmonary opacities and near
 complete white-out of bilateral lungs with relative sparing of the right upper
 lobe.  There is new obscuration of the cardiac silhouette as well as a
 bilateral diaphragmatic contours allowing for which, cardiomegaly is likely
 unchanged.  Bilateral effusions may be present.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The airway remains midline.  Note is made of an airdistended stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube with tip terminating 2.7 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Marked rapid progression of pulmonary disease with now diffuse dense
 opacification of bilateral lungs and mild sparing of the right upper lobe,
 overall appearance suggestive of ARDS.  
 
 3.  Moderate air distended stomach.  NGT placement should be considered.  
  
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ ___ phone at approximately 1pm on
 ___.
