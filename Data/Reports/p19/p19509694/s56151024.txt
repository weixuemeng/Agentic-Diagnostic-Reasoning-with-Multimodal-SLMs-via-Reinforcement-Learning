                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___,
 trachea CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged with superior mediastinal widening compatible with
 underlying lymphadenopathy. There is mild pulmonary edema, not substantially
 changed in the interval.  Hazy opacities within the lung bases are re-
 demonstrated, and better assessed on the recent CT. Known spiculated nodule in
 the right upper lobe is better assessed on the previous CT. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The lungs remain
 hyperinflated. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema, not sugstantially changed in the interval.
 2. Mild hazy opacities in the lung bases, better assessed on the previous CT
 exams, and potentially reflective of chronic thromboembolic disease.
 3. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy and cardiomegaly.
 4. Known right upper lobe spiculated nodule is better assessed on the previous
 CT.
