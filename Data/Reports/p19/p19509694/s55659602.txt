                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman with crackles, presenting with diarrhea,
 fever, desaturations today to high 80s. ? pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart appears to be enlarged as previously seen. There is increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion, more prominently on the left.  There is also
 slight widening of the upper mediastinum on the right, possibly indicating
 engorgement of the azygous vein.  Although no consolidation is noted, the
 pattern of pulmonary congestion makes it difficult to exclude an overlying
 developing infilterate. No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion, overlying developing
 infiltrate cannot be ruled out.
