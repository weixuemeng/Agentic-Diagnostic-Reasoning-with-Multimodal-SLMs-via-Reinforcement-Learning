                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure, new oxygen requirement and
 cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 As compared to prior examination, there is overall interval decrease in the
 widespread parenchymal opacities with still present right mid and lower lung
 opacities as well as left upper lung opacity seen, overall most likely
 reflecting slight interval improvement of the findings.  Cardiomegaly is
 demonstrated, moderate, unchanged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable and no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax seen.
