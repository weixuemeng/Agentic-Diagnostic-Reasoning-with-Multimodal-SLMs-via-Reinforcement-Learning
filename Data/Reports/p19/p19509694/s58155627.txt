                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There are persistent reticular opacities with hazy background
 opacity within in the mid-to-lower lungs or perhaps recurring opacity that is
 relatively confluent more in the right lower lobe than elsewhere.  Much of
 this appearance is suggestive of vascular congestion including indistinct
 upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity and thickening of fissures.
 A patchy focal right upper lobe opacity appears unchanged and is most
 suggestive of a form of prior scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which are most suggestive of pulmonary edema, although
 more confluent in the right lower lobe than elsewhere.  In the setting of high
 clinical suspicion for pneumonia, the possibility this represents a developing
 focal pneumonia as a second diagnosis could be considered in the appropriate
 setting.
