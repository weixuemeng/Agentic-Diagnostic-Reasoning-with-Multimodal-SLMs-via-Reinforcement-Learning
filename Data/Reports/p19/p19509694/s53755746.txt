                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, pulmonary edema.  Please evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs most recently
 dated ___ well as CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal
 contours.  There is stable mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  There has been
 interval increase in diffuse alveolar opacities with a basilar predomince,
 left greater than right with loss of left hemidiaphragm silhouette.  Given
 multiple prior studies demonstrating rapid increase and decrease of
 opacification and previously provided history of cocaine use, findings suggest
 acute non-cardiac pulmonary edema versus pulmonary toxicity. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased asymmetric predominantly basilar diffuse airspace
 opacifications likely represent acute non-cardiac edema vs pulmonary toxicity
 from inhaled substance.
