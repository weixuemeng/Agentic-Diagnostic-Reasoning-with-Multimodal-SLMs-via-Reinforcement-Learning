                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure, presents with cough and
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable severe
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable without
 evidence of vascular congestion to suggest overload.  
 There is redemonstration of the bibasilar somewhat reticular opacifications
 which have been present to varying degrees since initial presentation to ___
 in ___. Compared to next preceding radiograph, ___, there
 is mild interval improvement. Findings are better assessed on a CTA chest
 performed ___ at which point they were attributed to chronic
 lung changes thought to be sequelae of illicit drug use such as scarring,
 hemorrhage or chronic organized pneumonia.  No definite new focal
 opacification is identified.  There is redemonstration of the rounded lesion
 in the right upper lobe which appears stable since ___ and non-FDG
 avid on PET-CT performed ___.  Stability and lack of radiotracer
 uptake suggest this is an area of scarring.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.  No osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively stable if not slightly improved bibasilar
 opacifications present since ___ and though to reflect chronic
 inflammatory changes reactive to illicit drug use.  No definite new focal
 opacification identified.  Right upper lobe nodule, unchanged since ___
 and non-FDG avid as of ___.
