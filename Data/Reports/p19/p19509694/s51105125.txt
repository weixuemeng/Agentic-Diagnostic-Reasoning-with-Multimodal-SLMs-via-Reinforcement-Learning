                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leg swelling and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs well expanded.  Prominent
 interstitial markings are seen, predominantly in the bases.  This may be due
 to chronic underlying lung disease, but the presence of cardiomegaly suggests
 it may be a component of mild pulmonary.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly.
