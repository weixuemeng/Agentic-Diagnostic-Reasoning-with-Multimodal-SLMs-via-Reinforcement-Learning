 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.  Additional imaging dating
 back to ___ chest CT and ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to multiple
 prior exams, there has been no significant interval change and interstitial
 opacities most notably at the lung bases.  More spiculated opacity in the
 right upper lung is also seen.  When compared to remote priors this has not
 significantly changed and is most suggestive of a chronic process.  There is
 no definite superimposed consolidation.  There is no effusion.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is again seen and unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic parenchymal changes which have persisted and have not
 significantly changed since ___ and are likely chronic.  No definite
 superimposed process.
