                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of COPD and CHF now presenting with
 tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTs from
 ___ and ___.  
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse alveolar opacities are new and
 greater on the left compared to the right.  Though findings are typical for
 pulmonary edema, given the distribution and chronic appearance as compared to
 multiple prior CTs, consideration should be given to other causes, possibly a
 fulminant allergic or toxic alveolitis.  No large pleural effusions are
 evident.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Recurrent diffuse alveolar opacities.  Possibly due to pulmonary
 edema though other etiologies should also be considered given the distribution
 and chronicity.
