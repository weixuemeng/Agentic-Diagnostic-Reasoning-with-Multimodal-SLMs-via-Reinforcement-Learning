                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and body ache.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.There is new
 confluent opacification in the left upper lobe, particularly near the apex
 with lesser involvement elsewhere.  To a lesser degree, there is also new
 right apical opacification.  A right lower lung opacity is similar to
 improved, however.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Much more extensive lung opacification than seen on the prior
 study including confluent left apical opacification with a distribution that
 is not typical for pulmonary edema.  An infectious process could be
 considered, but the process is widespread but heterogenous, with a strikingly
 peripheral distribution in the left upper lobe which could be seen with an
 eosinophilic pneumonia, which has been described as a manifestation of
 cocaine-related lung disease.  A coinciding component of pulmonary edema is
 also possible.
