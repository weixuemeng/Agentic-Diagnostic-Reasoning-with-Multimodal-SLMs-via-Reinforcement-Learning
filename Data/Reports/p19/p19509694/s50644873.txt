                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and congestive heart failure with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including chest radiograph from ___ and FDG Tumor Imaging study from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are bilateral interstitial opacities, greater at the lung bases,
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  The previously reported right upper
 lobe spiculated opacity is again noted and better evaluated on prior FDG tumor
 imaging study.  Diffuse emphysematous changes are again noted throughout the
 lungs.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly. 
 
 2.  Right upper lobe spiculated opacity again noted and better delineated on
 prior FDG Tumor Imaging study.
