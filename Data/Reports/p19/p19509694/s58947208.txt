 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for adenopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight decrease
 in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, this is most
 notable at the left lung base as well as in the right upper lobe.  The
 opacities are still clearly visible in the left perihilar areas and in the
 right lower lobe.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is still at the upper
 range of normal, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The lateral
 radiograph shows no evidence of pleural effusions.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of adenopathy.
