                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have rapidly improved,
 with residual opacities now most prominent in the right lower and left upper
 and mid lung regions.  Considering rapid improvement and coexisting
 cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement, these findings likely represent
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Continued radiographic followup would be
 helpful to exclude other causes of airspace opacification such as pulmonary
 hemorrhage, aspiration, and infection.
