                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung
 volumes are quite low, which limit the evaluation.  There is crowding of
 bronchovasculature resulting of the low lung volumes.  Given this appearance,
 a subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No large effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable,
 although the patient is rotated to the left, which limits evaluation.  The
 bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study with low lung volumes.  No overt evidence of
 pneumonia or CHF.  If there is strong clinical concern for acute pathology, a
 repeat is recommended with more optimized technique.
