                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with near syncope, fall, back strike, prior back
 surgeries
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of cardiac silhouette which
 is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 and linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are moderate
 degenerative changes noted in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
