                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Arm sarcoma, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  The nodular opacities most likely reflect
 vessels on end.  However, if there is serious clinical concern for pulmonary
 metastases, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
