 check interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 postsurgical appearance of the right hemithorax with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectatic
 change.  Mild engorgement of the pulmonary vessels again suggest some minimal
 vascular congestion.
