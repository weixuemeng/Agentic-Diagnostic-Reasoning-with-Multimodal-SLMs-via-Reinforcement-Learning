                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // sob
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices, partially obscuring the
 view. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings. Patchy right basilar opacity may be due to confluence of structures
 and is not substantiated on the lateral view although a subtle consolidation
 is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
