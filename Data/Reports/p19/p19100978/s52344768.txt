                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Failure to thrive and abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  There is vague persistent opacity in the
 left lower lobe which is apparently a background finding, likely due to
 atelectasis.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent vague left base opacity, probably atelectasis.
