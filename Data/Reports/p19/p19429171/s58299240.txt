                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with bioprosthetic mitral valve endocarditis,
 CAD, and CHF.  New cough.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement
 in the previously seen pulmonary edema of the right lung.  The left lung,
 however, remains largely unchanged from the prior study.  There is
 opacification of the left lung base, likely representing left lower lobe
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  There has been little, if any, interval
 change since the prior study.  The right PICC line is in standard position,
 terminating in the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires are unchanged in position
 since the prior study.  There is severe bilateral shoulder degenerative
 disease, as seen previously.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema of the right lung. 
 Unchanged left lower lung opacification likely representing atelectasis and
 pleural fluid.  Some consolidation cannot be ruled out, however there has been
 no interval change for six days.  
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ page at
 ___, at the time of discovery.
