                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ as well as chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Pulmonary hypertension is present.  A
 right middle lobe opacity is unchanged, consistent with known combination of
 bronchiectasis and peribronchial opacities.  No new consolidations
 demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Dilated
 pulmonary veins are projecting over the cardiac silhouette, in particular on
 the left, mimicking pulmonary nodules.
