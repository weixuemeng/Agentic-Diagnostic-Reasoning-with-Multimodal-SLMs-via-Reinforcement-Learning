                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Rule out lung water.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to the only prior chest radiograph,
 ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Still dense consolidation in the
 right mid lung, probably displaced middle lobe.  I do know if it is recurrent
 or chronic pneumonia or a region of chronic scarring.  Lesser degree of the
 same problem is present in the lingula, both of which obscure respective
 borders of a very large cardiac silhouette.  Mediastinal vasculature is not
 dilated, but both hila are very large.  A 23 mm wide nodular opacity
 projecting over the lower pole of the left hilus could be a tortuous vessel or
 a small lung mass, and there is a suggestion of small lung nodules elsewhere,
 such as the mid lungs projecting over the fifth anterior ribs and fourth
 anterior interspace.  Cardiac configuration indicates dominant left atrial
 enlargement suggesting mitral valve pathology.
 
 Pleural effusions are minimal.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ was telephoned as requested and I discussed the findings
 with her.
