                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever with right lower lung field
 breath sounds reduced.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: When compared to previous exam, there has been no definite interval
 change.  Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities, right
 greater than left are again seen compatible with bronchiectasis and
 peribronchial opacities.  These may have subtly increased at the right lung
 base compared to prior.  Apparent increased opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung is due to patient's overlying scapula which was not in this
 position on prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar parenchymal opacities compatible with chronic changes,
 noting slightly conspicuous consolidation at the right lung base which could
 represent an active component of disease.  Consider PA and lateral for more
 complete evaluation.
