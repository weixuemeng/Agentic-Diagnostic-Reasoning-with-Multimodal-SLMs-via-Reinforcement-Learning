 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:33 PM
  1.  10 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lung and 6 mm nodular
  opacity projecting over the right upper lung which were not clearly present on
  the prior studies.  Recommend further evaluation with nonemergent chest CT.
  
  2.  Prominence of the interstitial markings, greater on the right than the
  left, likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema.  
  
  3.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and small right pleural
  effusion.
  
  4. Opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflecting a combination of edema
  and atelectasis; although, superimposed infection is possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The moderate right pleural effusion
 with opacity in the right lower lobe.  Prominence of the interstitial markings
 is noted greater on the right than the left which could reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  Chain suture in the left upper lung is unchanged.  There is
 a 10 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lung which is not
 clearly visualized on the lateral.  An additional 6 mm nodular opacity
 projecting over the right upper lung is not clearly visualized on the lateral.
 No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  10 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lung and 6 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the right upper lung which were not clearly present on
 the prior studies.  Recommend further evaluation with nonemergent chest CT.
 
 2.  Prominence of the interstitial markings, greater on the right than the
 left, likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema.  
 
 3.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and modearte right pleural
 effusion.
 
 4. Opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflecting a combination of edema
 and atelectasis; although, superimposed infection is possible.
