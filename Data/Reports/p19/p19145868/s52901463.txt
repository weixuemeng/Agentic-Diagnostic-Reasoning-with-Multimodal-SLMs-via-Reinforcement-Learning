                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, intubated.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently from
 ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Although there is a generalized increase in radiodensity in the right lung,
 which could be secondary to edema, increased opacification at the right lung
 apex at the site of prior radiation injury, may be secondary to pneumonia. 
 Diffuse interstitial abnormality, particularly within the right upper lobe is
 compatible with patient's known lymphangitic spread of cancer as seen on the
 prior chest CT examination, and overall appears slightly worse compared to the
 prior exam.  Mild left basilar atelectasis is persistent.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are stable.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  The
 heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Generalized increase in radiodensity in the right lung may be secondary to
 edema, however, pronounced opacification, particularly at the right lung apex
 is concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality throughout the right lung is consistent
 with patient's known lymphangitic spread of cancer.
 
 3.  ET tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.
