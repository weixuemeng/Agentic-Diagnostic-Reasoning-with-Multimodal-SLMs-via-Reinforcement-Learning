                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, history of lung cancer and pleural effusion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___ and
 CT chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval reaccumulation of a small right-sided pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion. 
 Redemonstrated is an unchanged interstitial abnormality within the right upper
 lobe, compatible with the patient's known lymphangitic spread of cancer, as
 per the prior chest CT examination.  No new focal consolidation is identified.
 There is no pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema. The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development of a small right pleural effusion. 
 
 2.  Unchanged right upper lobe interstitial abnormality, better evaluated on
 prior chest CT examination, and compatible with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
