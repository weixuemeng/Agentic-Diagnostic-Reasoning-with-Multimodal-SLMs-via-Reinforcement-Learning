 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 Comparison study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Peripheral consolidation in right lower lobe has slightly improved
 with better visualization of the right hemidiaphragm contour.  Adjacent small
 right pleural effusion is again demonstrated.  Left lung and pleural surfaces
 are clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in right lower lobe consolidation likely due
 to history of pulmonary contusion.  Adjacent small pleural effusion.
