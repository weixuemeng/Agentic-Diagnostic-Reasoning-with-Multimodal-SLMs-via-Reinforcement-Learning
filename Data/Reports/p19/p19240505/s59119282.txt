                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with resultant vascular crowding limiting the evaluation.
 There is moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no definite focal airspace
 opacity on this single projection to suggest pneumonia.  There is unchanged
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Dilation of the pulmonary artery is re- demonstrated.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. No convincing evidence of pneumonia on this single projection.
 3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary artery dilation.
