                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple granulomas, possible TB vs sarcoid
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged with similar
 enlargement of the hila compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Right perihilar opacity is re- demonstrated,
 perhaps minimally improved in the interval, with minimal patchy left perihilar
 ill-defined nodular opacities also appearing unchanged.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Streaky
 atelectasis is noted in the left lung base.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Hazy opacity in
 the right perihilar region persists, but is perhaps minimally improved from
 the previous radiograph, with ill-defined nodular opacities in the left
 perihilar region appearing unchanged.  No new focal opacity demonstrated. 
 Constellation of findings again may reflect active tuberculosis or
 sarcoidosis.
