                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with vomiting, seizures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy, probably in childhood given the small
 diameter of the sternal wires.  Right aortic arch can be seen with a variety
 of congenital cardiac conditions.  Misalignment between the second and third
 sternal wires could be significant an should be evaluated clinically.
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, probably normal, and account for for
 the heterogeneity in vascular crowding at the lung bases.  There is no good
 evidence for pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumonia.  Possible childhood surgery for congenital heart disease.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Examine sternum for any evidence of wound complications.
