                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset hypoxia after C-section, also
 with chorioamnionitis  // please evaluate for consolidation, pleural
 effusions, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.
 
 There is relatively minimal upper zone redistribution.  However, there are
 diffuse increased interstitial markings and vascular blurring, with more
 confluent opacity at the right base.  The appearance is consistent with
 interstitial and early alveolar edema.  Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, an
 underlying infectious infiltrate.
 
 No gross effusions.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, likely with interstitial and early alveolar edema.  No
 effusions.
 
 Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, an underlying infectious infiltrate.
