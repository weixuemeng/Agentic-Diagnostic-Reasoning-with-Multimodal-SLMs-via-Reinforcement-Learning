 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:24 PM
  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Widening of the mediastinal
  contour and prominence of the right infrahilar region is likely positional,
  although there is probable underlying atelectasis at the right infrahilar
  region as seen on subsequent chest radiograph.  Endotracheal tube terminates
  6.6 centimeters above the carina.
