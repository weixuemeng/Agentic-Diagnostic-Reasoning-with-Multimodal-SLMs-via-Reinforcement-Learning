                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is limited by underpenetrated technique and low lung volumes. 
 With this limitation in mind, a patchy opacity is present in right infrahilar
 region, but lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable allowing for low lung volumes.  There are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, which may represent patchy
 atelectasis, focal aspiration or early pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
