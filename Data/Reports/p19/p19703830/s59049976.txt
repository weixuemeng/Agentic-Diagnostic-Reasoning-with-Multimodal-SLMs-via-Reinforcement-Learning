                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Improving pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by decreased interstitial
 edema.  A more confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region may
 be due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but an infectious process
 cannot be excluded in this region.
