                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PEA arrest and cough, thick secretions,
 assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:11 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes remain diminished with crowding of the vasculature.  Patchy
 opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall, however, the vascularity
 appears more indistinct and therefore there is likely a superimposed element
 of interstitial edema since the prior study of ___.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
