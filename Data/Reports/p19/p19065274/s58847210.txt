                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to the
 lung, evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph is obtained.  In comparison to
 the prior study, the lungs are better expanded and numerous bilateral
 metastases are better demarcated.  The diffuse pattern of opacification caused
 by extensive metastatic disease makes it very difficult to appreciate any
 overlying consolidation; therefore  pneumonia should be diagnosed clinically. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No pleural effusions and no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant changes compared to the prior study.
