                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with acute tachycardia and hypotension, rule out
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT of ___ in this patient known
 with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pulmonary edema or new lung opacities.  Since prior exam,
 metastatic lung nodule burden may have decreased slightly.  Some of the nodule
 are now cavitated.  Mediastinal and cardiac contour is unchanged with
 bilateral hilar enlargement in a patient known with metastatic lymph nodes.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pulmonary edema or new lung consolidation.
 
 2.  Diffuse pulmonary metastases, perhaps mildly decreased, with some lesions
 that appear cavitary.
