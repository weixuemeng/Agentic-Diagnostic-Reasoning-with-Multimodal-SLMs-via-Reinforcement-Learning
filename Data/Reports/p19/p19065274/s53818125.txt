                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to CT torso
 from ___.
 
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules are seen scattered throughout the lungs
 bilaterally.  There is no definite superimposed large confluent consolidation
 or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.  Surgical clips noted in
 the upper abdomen in the right upper quadrant compatible with prior right
 nephrectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Significant burden of metastatic disease with innumerable bilateral pulmonary
 nodules.  Although no definite superimposed consolidation is identified, small
 area of infection would be difficult to exclude given burden of disease.
