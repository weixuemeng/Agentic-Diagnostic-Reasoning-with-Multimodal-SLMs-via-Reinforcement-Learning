                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Renal cell cancer, fever, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were performed, patient was
 positioned upright.  There are innumerable round metastatic lesions within
 both lungs which appear essentially stable from the prior CT torso, though
 mild progression cannot be assessed.  There is no clear evidence of a
 superimposed pneumonia.  Please note, given the underlying metastatic disease,
 a subtle consolidative process is impossible to exclude.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Innumerable pulmonary metastatic lesions, grossly stable.  No
 clear sign of superimposed pneumonia, though evaluation limited given the
 extensive metastatic burden.
