                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  RCC with metastatic disease to the lungs with shortness of
 breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the prior
 CT torso, there has been no significant change with innumerable bilateral
 pulmonary metastatic lesions again seen.  Evaluation for superimposed
 pneumonia limited given the extensive metastatic burden, though no clear sign
 of superimposed pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Innumerable pulmonary metastatic disease with no gross signs of
 superimposed acute process.  Please refer to subsequent CT for further
 details.
