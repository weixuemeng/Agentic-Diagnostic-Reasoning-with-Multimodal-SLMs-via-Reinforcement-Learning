                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread pulmonary nodules consistent with diffuse metastatic
 disease appear unchanged.  However, an area of coalescent opacification
 partially obscuring known mass is demonstrated within the left retrocardiac
 region, and could potentially be due to a developing area of infection given
 the clinical suspicion for this entity.  Heart size remains normal. 
 Enlargement of both hila consistent with known lymphadenopathy, and
 mediastinal lymph node enlargement is also present.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions are apparently new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible developing pneumonia within the left lower lobe.  Consider
 standard PA and lateral chest radiographs for more complete evaluation when
 the patient's condition permits.
 
 2.  Widespread pulmonary nodules and lymphadenopathy consistent with
 metastatic disease.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
