                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM FROM ___ AT 6:13
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with worsening hypoxemia, evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 7:24.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:13 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease. 
 Previously described more coalescent opacification in the left retrocardiac
 region is less apparent on the current examination and therefore may have
 represented superimposed shadows.  There is no developing area of
 consolidation that can be appreciated at this time.  Bilateral hilar
 enlargement is consistent with known lymphadenopathy.  There are small
 bilateral effusions.  There is apparent increase in lucency in the left
 costophrenic sulcus; however, this is an upright study and no pneumothorax can
 be identified at the apex.  Therefore, this is felt to likely be related to
 differences in positioning and lung volumes between the examinations.  Heart
 is stable in size.  Multiple clips are seen in the right upper abdomen.
