                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from OSH from earlier
 the same day, ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi erect frontal image of the chest.  A right-sided PICC
 terminates in the mid SVC.  A tracheostomy tube is seen in place.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  An additional catheter is
 seen overlying the abdomen.  
 
 An opacity is seen in the left lung base, concerning for pneumonia.  Increased
 mild opacity in the right mid lung may represent developing pulmonary edema. 
 There is a moderate to large left pleural effusion and a moderate right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is obscured by adjacent opacities.  Lucency is seen projecting over the
 mediastinum, which may represent air in the esophagus which would be
 concerning for a possible tracheoesophageal fistula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity in the left lung base, concerning for pneumonia. 
 
 2.  Increased mild opacity in the right mid lung may represent developing
 pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the left and moderate on
 the right.
 
 4.  Suspected abnormality of the esophagus, possibly a tracheoesophageal
 fistula.  Recommend comparison with old studies from outside hospitals.  If no
 prior imaging is available and if further characterization is desired, Chest
 CT should be obtained for further assessment.
 
 Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 8:18 a.m. ___ by
 phone.
