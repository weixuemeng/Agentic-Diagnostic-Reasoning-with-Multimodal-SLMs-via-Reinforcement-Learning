                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The right basal opacity appears to be still present, although improved since
 the prior study and might reflect interval decrease in size of infectious
 process.  Repeated evaluation in four weeks is recommended.  The finding is
 still persistent, assessment with chest CT would be required to exclude the
 possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.
