                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, dyspnea, orthopnea and wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Vague nodular
 opacity projecting over the right lower lung represents atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung is
 most likely secondary to atelectasis.  Consider repeat radiograph with more
 optimal inspiratory effort to further assess.
