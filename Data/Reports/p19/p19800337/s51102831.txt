 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation.  No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and
 mediastinal structures.  No lung nodules or masses.
 
 Dating back to previous exams from ___, the left hilus has always
 been slightly rounder and denser than on the right.  However, no pathologic
 contours are seen and the appearance of the hilus is unchanged with respect to
 size.
