 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  Again
 there is a small rib loculated hydro pneumothorax at the right base, though
 the surrounding opacification is less prominent.  Postsurgical changes with
 blunting of the costophrenic angle are again seen.  The left lung remains
 essentially clear.
 Of incidental note are multiple rib fractures and clavicular fracture at
 various stages of healing on the right.
