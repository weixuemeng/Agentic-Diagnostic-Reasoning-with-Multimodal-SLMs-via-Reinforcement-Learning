                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  pneumothorax and chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided chest tube is new in the interval with tip overlying the medial
 aspect of the left lower lung field. Previously noted large left pneumothorax
 is markedly decreased in size with only a small apical pneumothorax now
 visualized. The left lung has re-expanded with streaky opacities in the left
 lung base likely reflective of atelectasis.  Right subclavian central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the lower SVC. Right lung is clear.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with decreased size of left-sided
 pneumothorax, now small, with re-expansion of the left lung. Streaky left
 basilar atelectasis.
