                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.1 cm above the
 level of the carina.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  There is a right internal
 jugular central venous catheter ending in the mid-to-low SVC.  There is
 redemonstration of complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
 rightward displacement of the mediastinal structures, not significantly
 changed.  There is minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  The heart size
 cannot be assessed on this radiograph but was seen to be normal on the outside
 hospital CT dated ___.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  No
 right pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
 
 2.  Unchanged complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward
 shift of the mediastinal structures, seen to be secondary to a combination of
 consolidation and effusion on the outside hospital CT from ___. 
 An obstructing endobronchial or peribronchial lesion cannot be excluded.
