 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:31 PM
  
  1. An ET tube appears to terminate the level of the carina.  Recommend
  retraction by approximately 2 cm for safe positioning the lower trachea.
  2. Stable location of the right IJ central venous catheter, terminating at the
  cavoatrial junction.
  3. An enteric tube courses distally, with distal tip seen projecting below the
  lower aspect the film.  Distal side port is not definitively visualized.
  4. Low lung volumes. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouettes.
  5. Stable appearance of the lungs with the appearance of bibasilar atelectasis
  and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions
  are unchanged.
   The findings and recommendation above regarding ET tube were discussed by Dr.
  ___ with Dr. ___ on the ___ ___ at 11:29 PM,
  25 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lysis of adhesion now s/p ex lap, with NG 
 // please assess for NG location.      please assess for NG location.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:45.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 With the chin down, the tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin
 of the clavicles, no less than 4.5 cm above the carina.  It should be advanced
 3 cm for more secure positioning.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into the
 distended stomach and out of view.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema persists.  There is greater consolidation at the right
 lung base which could be a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis or
 concurrent pneumonia.  Careful clinical and radiographic followup advised. 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement are
 unchanged.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.  No
 pneumothorax.
