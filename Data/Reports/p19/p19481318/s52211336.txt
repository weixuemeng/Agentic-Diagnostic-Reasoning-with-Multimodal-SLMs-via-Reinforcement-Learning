                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SBO in setting of recent lap ccy, ventral hernia repair;
 s/p ex-lap with LoA, abdomen left open to enable close follow-up of inflamed
 bowel s/p re-exploration   primary abdominal closure POD1  // interval change,
 RSBI still 70sPlease perform ___ AM.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is increased right pleural effusion, persistent
 right lower lobe atelectasis, and new right middle lobe atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema have improved minimally. 
 Mediastinal widening is consistent with elevated central venous pressures. 
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC.  There is
 an enteric tube extending into the stomach with distal tip not visualized. 
 The ET tube is positioned at the thoracic inlet 6 cm above the carina.  For
 more secure positioning, the ET tube could be advanced 2cm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis.
 2.  Minimal improvement, pulmonary vascular congestion and edema.
 3.  The ET tube is positioned at the thoracic inlet.  For more secure
 positioning, the ET tube could be advanced 2cm.
