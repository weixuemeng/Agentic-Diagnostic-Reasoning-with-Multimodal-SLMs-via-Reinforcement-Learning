                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dCHF, CKD, appears volume overloaded  //
 evalauate volume status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Poor inspiratory effort time. There is evidence of increase in bibasilar
 pleural effusions. There is also some peribronchial cuffing and mild
 cephalization.  Increased linear opacity in the left base identified, most
 consistent with atelectasis although an evolving infection might have a
 similar appearance. Findings are overall consistent with the clinical
 suspicion of congestive change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate congestive changes, enlarging pleural effusions
 
 Enlarging and worsening left basal changes, still thought most likely to
 reflect atelectasis flow continued attention and correlation for clinical
 findings suggestive of pneumonia is suggested
