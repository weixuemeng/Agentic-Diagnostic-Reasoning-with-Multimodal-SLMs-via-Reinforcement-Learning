                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ and ___.    
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding. Increased opacities at the bilateral bases
 reflect small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. There is
 cephalization of pulmonary vessels, indistinct hila bilaterally, and increased
 interstitial markings, consistent with pulmonary edema. Superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cephalization of pulmonary vessels, indistinct hila, and increased
 interstitial markings are consistent with pulmonary edema. Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
