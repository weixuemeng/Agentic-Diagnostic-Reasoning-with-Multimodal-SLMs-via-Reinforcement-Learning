                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with HD line placement, not working, placed today  // HD line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a left subclavian approach
 hemodialysis catheter, its tip which projects over the anticipated location of
 the right atrium.  Heart size is upper limits of normal in size, likely
 exaggerated by slightly low lung volumes.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is consistent with a small to moderate pleural effusion.  There is mild
 central pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. There is
 no pneumothorax.  Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Vascular stent
 projects over left upper extremity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion.
 Left-sided dual lumen central venous catheter with distal tip in the right
 atrium.
