                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of right upper
 extremity swelling on side with tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lumen
 right-sided central venous dialysis catheter is seen, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged.  There
 is right base plate-like atelectasis.  Previously seen left lower lobe
 consolidation has essentially resolved in the interval.  Mild linear left mid
 lung atelectasis/scarring is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 Hilar contours are stable to possibly mildly engorged.  No pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided central venous dialysis catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  If atrial position is desired, should be advanced approximately 2
 cm.  Persistent marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 2.  Right base plate-like atelectasis and mild left mid lung linear
 atelectasis/scarring.  Previously seen left lower lobe consolidation has
 essentially resolved in the interval.
