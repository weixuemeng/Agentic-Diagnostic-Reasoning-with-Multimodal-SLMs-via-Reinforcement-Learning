                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HIV sent from rehab with abnormal labs, altered
 mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Heart
 size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Lung volumes are low with mild crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 clearly visualized.  A right-sided PICC tip terminates in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
