 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:56 AM
  1.  1.7 cm pulmonary lesion within the right upper hemi thorax, better
  characterized on ___ CT. 2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe
  opacity is most consistent atelectasis, however differential includes early
  pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  3. Left lower lobe atelectasis

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with nausea vomiting and diarrhea x 24h. Vomitus is bilious
 in ER. RUQ tenderness. Known CAD, rales on exam.  Assess for acute biliary
 pathology, acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 1.7 x 1.4 cm hyperdensity along the right upper hemi thorax is most consistent
 with known lung lesion seen on ___ CT.  A heterogeneous right
 lower lobe opacity is only seen on frontal projection.  Plate like opacity
 along the left lower lobe is most consistent with atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise well inflated and clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  1.7 cm pulmonary lesion within the right upper hemi thorax, better
 characterized on ___ CT.
 2.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent atelectasis,
 however differential includes early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 3.  Left lower lobe atelectasis
