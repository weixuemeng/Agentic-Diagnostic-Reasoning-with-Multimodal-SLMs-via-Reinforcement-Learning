                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Consolidative
 opacity in the left upper lobe is highly concerning for pneumonia.  The right
 lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes seen within the thoracic spine as well as
 within the imaged right acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left upper lobe pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs are recommended after
 treatment to ensure resolution of this finding.
