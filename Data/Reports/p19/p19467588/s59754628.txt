 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible developing pneumonia.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the
 proximal to mid SVC.  There are again seen heterogeneous airspace opacities
 throughout both lungs mostly within a perihilar distribution.  There are
 linear opacities at the lung bases likely due to atelectasis.  Continued
 interval followup is recommended to assess for developing pneumonia.
