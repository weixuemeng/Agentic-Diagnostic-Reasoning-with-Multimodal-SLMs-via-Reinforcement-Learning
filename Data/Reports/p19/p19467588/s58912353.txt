                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, vomiting, on TPN.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with mediastinal clips noted. 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Right PICC tip terminates
 within the SVC/right atrial junction.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities are present.  There is no free air
 under the diaphragms.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflective of atelectasis, though
 aspiration or early infection are not completely excluded.
