                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension during transfusion.  Question TRALI.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from thoracic spine CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The aorta appears tortuous and calcified with some widening of the
 mediastinal contour.  The morphology is unchanged.  The lung volumes are low. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominent perihilar
 vessels suggesting mild fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Transfusion
 associated lung injury may appear similar to pulmonary edema, however, but
 radiographic findings are mild.
