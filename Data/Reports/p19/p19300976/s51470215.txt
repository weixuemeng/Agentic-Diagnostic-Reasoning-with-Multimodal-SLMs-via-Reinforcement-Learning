                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with SVC syndrome secondary to ovarian cancer,
 new crackles at her lung bases, evaluate for abnormality.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As on the prior exam, there are low lung volumes, likely accentuating the
 transverse diameter of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, unchanged.  The hila
 are prominent, which may reflect crowding of normal bronchovascular structures
 and pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There
 is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Posterior spinal fusion hardware consisting of rods with transpedicular screws
 is grossly unremarkable on limited radiographic evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable chest radiograph
