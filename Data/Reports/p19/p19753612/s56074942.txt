 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right middle and lower lobe collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 4:50 and 5:10 p.m.:
 
 Previous right middle lobe collapse has improved minimally.  There is probably
 also a substantial residue of atelectasis in the lower lobe.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement are unchanged. 
 Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian vascular line, and transvenous
 atrio-biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are all in standard placements. 
 No pneumothorax.  Some right pleural effusion is presumed but cannot be
 quantified.
