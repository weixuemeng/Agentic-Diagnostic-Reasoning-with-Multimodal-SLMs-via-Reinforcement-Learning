                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung
 volumes and slightly underpenetrated technique somewhat limits the evaluation.
 Allowing for this, there is no definite sign of pneumonia or overt CHF. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
