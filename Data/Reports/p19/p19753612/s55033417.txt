 AP CHEST, 5:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after stroke.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower today than on preceding two days, suggesting greater
 opacification at the left base is atelectasis, though I cannot distinguish it
 from pneumonia.  There is residual mild interstitial edema and
 small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions all grossly unchanged.  Heart
 size is top normal.  Hilar enlargement is stable, probably vascular, and
 mediastinal veins are also distended.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard
 placement.  Trans-subclavian biventricular atrial pacer defibrillator leads
 are in standard placements, continuous from the left axillary pacemaker. 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  No pneumothorax.
