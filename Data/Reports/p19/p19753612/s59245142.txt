                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemorrhagic conversion, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 4:56 a.m.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in place.  A right IJ line is present -- the tip is
 obscured, but appears to overlie the mid/distal SVC.   
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. Left-sided pacemaker/AICD-type device is
 present, with lead tips nominal in position.  Compared with the prior film,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is mild upper zone
 re-distribution, though I doubt other evidence of CHF.  Again seen is a small
 right effusion, with minimal collpase/consolidation at the right base and some
 increased retrocardiac opacity.  Possible slight interval improvement at the
 left base.  No gross left effusion.  Plate-like atelectasis noted overlying
 the left hilum.
