 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette and is within normal limits and
 there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 There are extensive bilateral opacifications that appeared to represent
 calcified pleural plaques.  Calcification in the diaphragmatic pleura is also
 seen, suggesting that this represents asbestos-related disease, though there
 is no significant interstitial lung disease appreciated on the limited plain
 radiographs.
