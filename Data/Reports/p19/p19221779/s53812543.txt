                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Asymmetry in radiodensity, greater in the right lower lung than on the left,
 but insufficient to render diagnosis of pneumonia.  Bronchial cuffing is
 probably due to bronchial inflammation, which would explain coughing.  There
 is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
