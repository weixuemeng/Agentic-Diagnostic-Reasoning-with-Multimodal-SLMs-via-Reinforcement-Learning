                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, line pulled back a ___ time. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable supine AP image of the chest. 
 
 The right IJ central line has been pulled back in the interval and now
 terminates in the superior direction junction.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 There has been interval mild increased cephalization of the pulmonary vessels,
 which may be partly or wholly due to supine positioning, making it difficult
 to evaluate for pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right IJ central line terminates in the superior cavoatrial junction.  
 
 2.  Interval mild increased cephalization of the pulmonary vessels, which may
 be partly or wholly due to supine positioning, making it difficult to evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
