                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent cholangitis, central line partially pulled.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:35 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been pulled back.  The tip of the catheter now projects
 above the clavicle.  The catheter should be repositioned to ensure a correct
 position in the mid SVC.  Therefore, advancement of the catheter by
 approximately 5 cm would be required.
