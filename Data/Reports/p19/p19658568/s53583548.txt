                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left sided chest pain  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung is clear.  However, there is subtle right infrahilar opacity
 which may be due to overlap of vascular structures and costochondral
 calcification, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.  It is not well
 substantiated however, on the lateral view.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle right infrahilar opacity may be due to overlap of vascular structures
 in costochondral calcification, but underlying consolidation is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Finding is not well substantiated on the
 lateral view, however.
