                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, evaluate tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip lies approximately 2.9 cm above the carina,
 pointing towards the right tracheal wall.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  
 
 Possible mild cardiomegaly.  The superior mediastinum is prominent and could
 be enlarged.  No overt CHF.  NO definite infiltrate. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Possible minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle. No
 frank consolidation. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
 Left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.
 
  
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) ET tube approximately 2.9 cm above the carina.  
 2) Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  If there is concern
 for an infectious infiltrate, then a lateral view may help for further
 assessment.  
 3) Possible enlargement of the superior mediastinum. Clinicial correlation
 requested. PA upright chest or alternatively cross sectional imaging could
 help for further assessment.
