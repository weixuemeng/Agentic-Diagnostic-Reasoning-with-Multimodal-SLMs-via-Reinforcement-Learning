                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Gastrojejunal bleeding and bowel perforation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not
 otherwise imaged, however.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky
 retrocardiac opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  The lungs appear otherwise
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
