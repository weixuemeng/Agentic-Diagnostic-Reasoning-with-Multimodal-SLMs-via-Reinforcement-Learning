                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall from standing, generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The central pulmonary vasculature is
 slightly prominent suggesting mild fluid overload which may be minimally
 increased since the prior study versus differences in technique.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  No displaced rib fracture is identified
 radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent cardiomegaly.  Suggestion of mild fluid overload.
