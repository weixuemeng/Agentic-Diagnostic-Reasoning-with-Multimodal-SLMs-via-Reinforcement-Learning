                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, CHF, and dyspnea. 
 Question change since prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from ___.
 
 When compared to prior, there has been interval development of more confluent
 consolidation identified in the right lower lobe.  Indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature is again seen throughout both lungs.  Obscuration of the
 left lateral costophrenic angle could be due to fat pad or atelectasis. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right base region of consolidation which could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, no significant
 interval change in findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
