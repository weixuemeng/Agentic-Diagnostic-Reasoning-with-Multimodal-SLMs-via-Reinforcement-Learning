                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The volume of aerated lung is significantly
 decreased on the current examination as compared with recent prior.  Bilateral
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left, have increased
 in the interval.  New opacities in the lung bases and medial right upper lobe
 are non-specific in appearance and may reflect multifocal pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.  Alternative the basilar opacities could
 reflect compressive atelectasis and the right upper opacity asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  New moderate hilar fullness could reflect adenopathy or
 vascular engorgement.  Chest CT is recommended for further clarification given
 the shortness of breath.  Evaluation of the cardiac contours is limited due to
 the basilar opacities. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple new opacities which could reflect multifocal pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.  Recommend chest CT for further
 characterization.
 
 2.  Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, both small-to-moderate though
 right greater than left.
