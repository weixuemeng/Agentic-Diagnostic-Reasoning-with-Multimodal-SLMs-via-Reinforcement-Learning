                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R pleural effusion s/p tap  // r/o R pleural
 effusion      r/o R pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There is little if any
 vascular congestion, and this discordance raises the possibility
 cardiomyopathy.
 There has been decrease in the pleural effusion on the right following
 thoracentesis with no evidence of pneumothorax.  The extensive rounded areas
 of opacification at the right base suggests that much of this represents
 loculated pleural effusion, as suggested on the CT scan of ___.
