                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new right sided chest tube  // r/o PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done on ___ 11:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided basilar pigtail catheter with interval
 decrease in size of the right pleural effusion and increased aeration overall
 in the right lung.  There is persistent airspace consolidation in the right
 lower lung likely representing residual partial lower lobe collapse.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Cardiac mediastinal contours are difficult to
 assess due to marked patient rotation on the current study, although the heart
 remains enlarged.  Overall, the left lung remains grossly clear.  No pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided pigtail pleural drain with interval decrease
 in size of right-sided pleural effusion and improved aeration of the right
 lung.  No pneumothorax is identified.
