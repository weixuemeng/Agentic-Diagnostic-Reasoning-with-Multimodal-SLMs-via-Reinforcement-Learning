                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and altered mental status.  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right hemodialysis
 catheter terminating in the right atrium.  There is moderate cardiomegaly,
 unchanged.  Azygos dilatation and mild interstitial edema is chronic.  The
 right basilar opacity seen on most recent radiograph has improved.  There are
 mild retrocardiac opacities suggesting atelectasis, though an infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
