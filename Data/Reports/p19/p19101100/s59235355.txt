 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation with guarding.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___ through
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.

 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear. 
 Trace fluid tracks along the major and minor fissure on the right side though
 there is no notable pleural effusion.  Cephalization of vasculature is
 compatible with mild fluid overload.  Pleural surfaces are otherwise clear

 from prior biceps tendon repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly with trace fluid tracking along the major and
 minor fissures on the right and mild vascular congestion.
