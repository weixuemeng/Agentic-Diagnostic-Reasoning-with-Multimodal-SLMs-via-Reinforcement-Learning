                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness in a patient with systolic heart failure, latent TB,
 end-stage renal disease on dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is again seen.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lungs are
 clear.  Cephalization of vessels is compatible with mild fluid overload,
 similar compared to the prior study.  Again noted are tenodesis screws in the
 right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion with small right pleural effusion and
 persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
