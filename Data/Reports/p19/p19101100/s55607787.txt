                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is mild perihilar fullness and hazy predominantly
 perihilar opacification, including upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary
 vascularity, suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  In addition, a
 focal opacity in the right lower lobe suggests pneumonia, probably also
 involving the right middle lobe, not significantly changed.  There is a
 suspected small pleural effusion on the left.  Mild-to-moderate rightward
 convex curvature is centered along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent focal opacities in the right lower lung suggesting pneumonia.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
