 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R chest tube  // s/p R chest tube on
 suction, f/u pleural effusion      s/p R chest tube on suction, f/u pleural
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  The only available chest radiograph was performed ___ at
 06:06.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval clearing of right pleural effusion, pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter in place.  Possible tiny pleural air collection at the right
 base laterally, presumably a function of drainage.  Unusually sharply defined
 4 cm wide spherical opacity in the right projecting over the right lower chest
 could be a lung nodule or pleural loculation.  No pneumothorax.  Severe
 cardiac silhouette enlargement unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature however is no
 longer so it distended and there is no pulmonary edema.
