                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper quadrant pain and worsening
 dyspnea.  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and hepatitis
 C.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent right upper
 quadrant ultrasound
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There has been interval development of a
 moderate right pleural effusion accompanied by sufficient right lung
 atelectasis to avoid mediastinal shift.  Findings are confirmed on concurrent
 abdominal ultrasound.  There is likely atelectatic collapse of the right lower
 lobe.  The left lung shows pulmonary vascular congestion verging on mild
 edema.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is unchanged from prior examination.  There is no pneumothorax.  A large
 caliber dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. New recurrence of moderate right pleural effusion.  If there is subphrenic
 infection this could be empyema, although prior findings suggest the cause is
 hemodynamic.  2.  New mild cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload,
 chronic moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 Findings were discussed over the telephone at the time of dictation with Dr
 ___.
