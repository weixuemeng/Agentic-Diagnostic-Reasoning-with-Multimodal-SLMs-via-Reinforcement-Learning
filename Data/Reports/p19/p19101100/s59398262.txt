                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AMS  // r/o pna      r/o pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal vascular prominence. This
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. There is
 increased opacification at the right base. Although this could merely reflect
 pleural fluid and atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
