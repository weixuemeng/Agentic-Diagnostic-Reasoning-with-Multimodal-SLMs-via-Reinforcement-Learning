                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and change in mental status. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is consolidation of the right lung base, likely due to
 collapse of the right lower lobe and partial collapse of the right middle lobe
 with an associated large pleural effusion.  The minor fissure is still
 visible, denoting that there is at least some portion of the right middle lobe
 still aerated.  This consolidation is essentially unchanged compared with
 prior exam.  The remaining right lung and the left lung field demonstrate
 prominent vascular markings, likely secondary to pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged compared with
 prior exam.  A small pleural effusion is present on the left.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A tunneled dialysis catheter is noted ending in the right
 atrium.  The right humeral head shows two anchors.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse associated with
 large pleural effusion are unchanged compared with prior exam.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with new small pleural effusion in the left along with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Dialysis catheter ending in the right atrium, unchanged from prior exam.
