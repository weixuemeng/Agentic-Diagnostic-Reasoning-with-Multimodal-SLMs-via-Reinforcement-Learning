                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with similar mediastinal contours. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly improved compared to the
 previous study.  Moderate to large right pleural effusion which is loculated
 partially laterally appears increased from the previous study.  Worsening
 opacification of right lung base may reflect atelectasis, however infection is
 not excluded.  There is a small left pleural effusion with left basilar
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacification in the right lung base may reflect increased
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  Increased size of large right
 partially loculated pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved in the interval.
