                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiograph views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right pigtail catheter has been removed in the interim.  Complete
 opacification of the right lower and mid hemithorax with silhouetting of the
 right heart border and right hemidiaphragm is new.  There is associated
 rightward shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  These findings suggest
 volume loss.  However, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded given the
 clinical history.  The heart appears enlarged, overall similar to the prior
 exam.  Streaky retrocardiac opacities are most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  There is a small effusion extending in the
 minor fissure seen on both the frontal and lateral views.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right mid-lower hemithorax opacification has increased since ___
 after the removal of the pigtail catheter and may reflect a combination of
 moderate effusion and atelectasis, but cannot exclude superimposed
 consolidation/pneumonia.
 2.  Mild edema.
