                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours remain widened, due to mediastinal lipomatosis.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, similar compared to the previous exam, and a
 probable small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and small right pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
