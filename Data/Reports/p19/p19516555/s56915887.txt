                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 two exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, slightly
 worse than in the prior exam.  Bibasilar consolidations are not significantly
 changed from the prior exam, and likely represent atelectasis.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are widened.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  This is stable from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.
 2.  Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Stable appearance of the enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.
