                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of fluid overload, assessment for chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right central venous
 access line has been removed.  The radiograph is technically limited by
 patient constitution.  Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  Bilateral areas of atelectasis at the
 lung bases.  The presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
