                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post head surgery, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing signs
 indicative of pulmonary edema have moderately increased.  The heart is
 markedly enlarged.  There is bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses,
 suggesting the presence of pleural effusions.  Overall, the radiographic
 appearance of the patient has progressed.  In addition, a staple line is seen
 paralleling the descending aorta.  The patient is rotated and the trachea
 continues to be shifted towards the right.  The changes should receive
 attention on close radiographic followup.
