                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post discectomy, intubated now with low
 O2 saturation.  Study requested for evaluation of aspiration and tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  This exam is suboptimal due to underpenetration from patient's body
 habitus. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina.  Large
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is again seen.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Vascular structures are dilated consistent with volume overload.  Evaluation
 of increased densities of the lung bases bilaterally is particularly
 suboptimal and it is impossible to determine how much is due to atelectasis
 versus recent aspiration or pulmonary edema.  Small pleural effusions are
 present at best.  No large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube is in adequate position, 4.9 cm above the carina.
 
 2. Limited evaluation of increased densities at lung bases, difficult to
 determine how much is related to atelectasis, recent aspiration or pulmonary
 edema.
