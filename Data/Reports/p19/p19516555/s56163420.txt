                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and leukocytosis.  Study
 requested for evaluation of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:   There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the cardiomediastinal
 contours and bronchovascular structures. There are bilateral patchy lower lobe
 opacities. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, related to known
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  There are degenerative changes along the lower
 thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral patchy lower lobe opacities, which could represent atelectasis,
 aspiration or pneumonia. In the setting of low lung volumes, characterization
 is limited and a repeat chest radiograph with increased inspiratory level may
 be helpful in this regard.
 
 2. Stable, widened cardiomediastinal silhouette related to known mediastinal
 lipomatosis.
