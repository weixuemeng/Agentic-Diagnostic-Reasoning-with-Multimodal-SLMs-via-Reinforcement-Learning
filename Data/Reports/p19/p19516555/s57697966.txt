                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam, which causes crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion may
 be present, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with apparent
 widening of the superior mediastinum likely attributable to mediastinal
 lipomatosis.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.  Assessment of
 the lung bases is limited due to low lung volumes, with minimal patchy
 opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is
 demonstrated.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
