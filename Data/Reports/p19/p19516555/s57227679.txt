                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to underpenetration.  Cardiac silhouette
 size remains moderately enlarged, primarily due to the presence of prominent
 epicardial fat.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is also unchanged and
 attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted, with mild vascular congestion, similar to the prior chest
 radiograph. Lung volumes are low with mild patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities, likely atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.
