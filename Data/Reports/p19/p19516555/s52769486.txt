                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, cough and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and on ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is rotated ___ and the lung volumes are low, both of
 which extremely limit interpretation.  Further evaluation is limited by
 overlying soft tissue. 
 
 There is a probable small right pleural effusion, best appreciated on the
 lateral view.  Overlying opacities are likely atelectasis and superimposed
 soft tissue.  A more focal opacity at the right medial base could represent
 pneumonia in the correct setting.  There is no pneumothorax.  The widened
 appearance of the mediastinum is secondary to mediastinal lipomatosis as
 demonstrated on the prior CT.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Probable small right pleural effusion.
 2. More focal opacity at the right medial base could represent pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting.
