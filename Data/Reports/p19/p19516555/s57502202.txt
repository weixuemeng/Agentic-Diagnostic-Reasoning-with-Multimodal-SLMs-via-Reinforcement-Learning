                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Low back pain, preop chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is suboptimal due to underpenetration from patient body
 habitus.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is again seen, which is likely
 due to mediastinal lipomatosis.  Evaluation of the lung bases, particularly on
 the left, is suboptimal due to underpenetration and a small focal
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No large pneumothorax.  No definite
 pleural effusion, although small pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.  There are low lung volumes with possible mild vascular congestion
 with vascular structures appearing similar to prior.
