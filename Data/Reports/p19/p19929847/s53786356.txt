 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infiltrate in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate intact sternal wires and
 clips along the left mediastinum.  The heart is top-normal in size.  Opacity
 projecting over the lower lungs on lateral view may correspond to either
 retrocardiac opacity or right infrahilar opacity.  There are bilateral small
 pleural effusions and possible mild heart failure.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacity projecting over the lower lung on lateral view may correspond
 either retrocardiac or right infrahilar opacity.
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and possible mild heart failure.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Oblique views may be helpful in further evaluation of
 lower lung opacity seen on lateral view.
