 Comparison to prior study ___ at 6 a.m. 
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable cardiac enlargement likely reflecting cardiomegaly.  There is a
 bilateral interstitial abnormality which could reflect interstitial edema,
 although chronic underlying interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pleural effusions.  No focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Calcification of the
 aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis.
