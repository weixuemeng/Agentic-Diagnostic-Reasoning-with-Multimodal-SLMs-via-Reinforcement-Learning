                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, COPD, septic left hip, now short of breath and agitated,
 question volume overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, Slightly Llrdotic lositioning.  Compared with ___
 at 15:39 p.m., there has been progressive opacification of both lungs, with
 partial sparing of the lung bases.  The most likely etiology is pulmonary
 edema, but there is minimal, if any, pleural fluid and the differential
 diagnosis includes additional causes of confluent alveolar opacities.  Again
 seen is cardiomegaly and a left-sided PICC line which terminates the distal
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening of diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this would be consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Relative lack of effusions, however, is somewhat unusual for this.
