                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, findings which may
 reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Minimal loss of height anteriorly of a low
 thoracic vertebral body is of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  Mild anterior wedge compression deformity of a low thoracic
 vertebral body, of indeterminate age.
