                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including cardiomegaly.  The lung volumes are low.  The right costophrenic
 angle is obscured suggesting a small pleural effusion.  Right lateral pleural
 thickening appears stable.  There is probably also a small pleural effusion on
 the left side.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base has decreased and
 probably is due to minor atelectasis or scarring.  A mild interstitial process
 is similar to the prior study and could be seen with mild pulmonary edema,
 although chronicity is uncertain since it is not a substantial change. 
 Carotid bulb calcifications are present bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar mild interstitial abnormality suggesting mild pulmonary
 edema although, given the lack of change, acuity is uncertain.
