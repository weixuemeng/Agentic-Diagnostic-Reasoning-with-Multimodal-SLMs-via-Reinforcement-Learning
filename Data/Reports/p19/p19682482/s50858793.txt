                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures and intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been some decrease in
 the opacification at the right base, though this may be due at least in part
 to change in patient's position.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes
 have been removed.
 
 The residual opacification at the right base is consistent with volume loss in
 the lower lung and pleural effusion. The degree of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure is essentially unchanged.  The base of the left lung now appears
 clear.
