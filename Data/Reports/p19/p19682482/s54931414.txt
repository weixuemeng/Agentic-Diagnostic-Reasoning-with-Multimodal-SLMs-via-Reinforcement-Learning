                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Rotated positioning.  An NG tube is present.
 The tip is poorly visualized. However, compared to the film obtained on
 ___ at 17:33 p.m., the edge-enhancement image suggests interval
 advancement of the NG tube tip to immediately beyond the GE junction.  The
 sideport is not directly visualized.  Low inspiratory volume and pulmonary
 parenchymal findings are grossly unchanged.
