                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:13 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, now intubated, assess for
 change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 9:55.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:13 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina.  A left internal
 jugular central line has its tip unchanged in position in the proximal-to-mid
 SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Persistent consolidation at the right lung base which likely
 reflects a combination of pleural effusion and/or atelectasis/pneumonia.  When
 compared to prior study, however, there has been interval appearance of
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  A small left effusion is also likely.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged, although somewhat difficult to assess due to the superimposed
 airspace process.
