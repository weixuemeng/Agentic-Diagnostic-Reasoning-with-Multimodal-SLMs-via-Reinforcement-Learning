                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ cirrhosis, question NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip is obscured by overlying soft tissue
 structures, traced only to the lower mediastinum, and does not clearly cross
 the GE junction.  If clinically indicated, this could be further assessed with
 an additional view centered at the level of the diaphragms, with increased
 penetration.  
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, unchanged.  There is bilateral pulmonary
 vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Some increased
 retrocardiac density is also present, unchanged.  No gross effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
