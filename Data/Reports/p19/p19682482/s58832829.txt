                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, decompensated with hepatic encephalopathy and known
 seizure disorder and persistent altered mental status.  Assess for
 intrapulmonary infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with adjacent atelectasis.  Minimal
 opacification in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No overt
 pulmonary edema identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  No pleural effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right hemidiaphragm elevation.  No pneumonia identified.
