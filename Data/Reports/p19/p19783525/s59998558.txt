                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle increase in interstitial markings bilaterally which could be due to
 mild interstitial edema or atypical infection.  No airspace consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally could relate
 to mild interstitial edema, although atypical infection is not excluded. 
 Alternatively, it could relate to underlying chronic lung disease.  However,
 this appears increased compared to ___.
