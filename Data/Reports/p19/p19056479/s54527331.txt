                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Emphysema and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits, though the mediastinal structures are somewhat
 shifted to the left due to volume loss after previous left lower lobe
 lobectomy.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is again seen, most likely related to the prior
 surgery.  The right lung is clear.
