                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS DATED ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new AFib, atrial flutter, presents with bright
 red blood per rectum.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Extremely low lung
 volumes are seen particularly on the lateral.  Linear bibasilar opacities
 therefore are suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no large confluent
 consolidation.  Costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is confirmed
 as interposition of colonic loops above the liver on the lateral.  Soft
 tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No confluent consolidation.
