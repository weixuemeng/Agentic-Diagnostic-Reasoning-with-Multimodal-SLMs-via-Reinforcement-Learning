                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dysphagia and history of myasthenia ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is similar volume
 loss in the right hemithorax with opacification at the medial right apex and
 thickening of what appears to represent the minor fissure.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic sulcus has increased and suggests minor scarring or
 atelectasis with a potential small effusion.  There is also patchy new
 opacification in the right lower lobe compared to the prior chest radiographs
 while the left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new right lower lobe opacity with possible small pleural
 effusion.  Depending on the clinical setting, mild pneumonia or sequelae of
 aspiration could be considered, although evolving scarring or atelectasis with
 associated with an interval effusion could also be considered.
