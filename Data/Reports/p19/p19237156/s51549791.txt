                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure s/p intubation  //
 Interval change post-extubation?      Interval change post-extubation?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC. 
 Nasogastric tube is coiled in the moderately distended stomach.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions and severe bibasilar consolidation, pneumonia and
 probably atelectasis as well, have not changed appreciably since earlier in
 the day, given the improvement due to intubation.  No pneumothorax. Heart size
 normal.  Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is normal.  I do not believe any
 pulmonary edema is present.
