                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 A recent outside hospital chest film from ___ is now available for
 comparison.
 
 As compared to this examination, the described right lung parenchymal
 opacities have clearly increased in both extent and severity.  The increased
 density of the left hilus and the shape of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent cough, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 parenchymal opacities in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe.  The
 opacities are partly nodular, partly linear in appearance.  There also might
 be minimal thickening of the right minor fissure.  On the lateral radiograph,
 the lower aspects of the right major fissure also appear slightly thickened. 
 Overall, the findings are strongly suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 The left lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  However, the left hilus appears
 minimally denser than on the previous radiograph from ___.
 
 There are no reactive pleural effusions, but flattened diaphragms provide
 evidence of moderate overinflation.  There is status post CABG and valvular
 replacement.  The sternal wires are unchanged.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is constant.
 
 At the time of observation and dictation, 11:12 a.m., on ___, the
 referring physician, ___. ___, was paged for notification and the findings
 were subsequently discussed over the telephone.  Because of the smoking
 history of the patient as well as evidence from outside hospitals of slowly
 resolving pneumonia in the past, it was agreed that performing a CT to clarify
 the morphologic situation in the lungs of the patient would be a reasonable
 next diagnostic step.
