                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fatigue.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the areas of opacification in
 the right mid and upper zones are less prominent, consistent with clearing of
 the region of organizing pneumonia.  Some residual fibrotic change is now
 seen.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.
