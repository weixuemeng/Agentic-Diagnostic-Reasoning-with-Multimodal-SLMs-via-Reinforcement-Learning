                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right VATS and wedge biopsy x3. 
 Status post chest tube pull.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a right pleural tube and there
 is miniscule, if any, apical pneumothorax present.  A moderate left pleural
 effusion is present.  The previously seen right mid lung opacification likely
 representing hematoma or atelectasis is again demonstrated.  There is also
 some right basilar atelectasis, unchanged since prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval removal of right pleural tube with miniscule, if any,
 right apical pneumothorax.  There is a small-to-moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise, unchanged since prior study.
