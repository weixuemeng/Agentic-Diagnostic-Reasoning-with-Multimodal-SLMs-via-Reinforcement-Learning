  1. 3 partially imaged stacked mildly dilated loops of bowel with the left
  upper quadrant is concerning for small-bowel obstruction.
  2. Enteric feeding tube in stomach with side port above the gastroesophageal
  junction. Consider advancing 10 cm for better positioning.
  3. Left lower lobe atelectasis with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
  4.  Right IJ tip in mid SVC.
  5. Stable mild cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   Right IJ. Assess right IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube
 coursing mid line with tip in stomach and side ports above the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Right IJ tip is in mid SVC. Intact median
 sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, and chain suture material projecting over
 the right mid lung.
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 with retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis. Right lung is
 clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen demonstrates 3 stacked mildly dilated
 loops of bowel within the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings concerning for small-bowel obstruction have been more fully
 evaluated by dedicated abdominal CT.
 2.  Enteric feeding tube in stomach with side port above the gastroesophageal
 junction. Consider advancing 10 cm for better positioning.
 3.  Bibasilar patchy and linear atelectasis; elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.
 4.  Right IJ tip in mid SVC.
 5.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
