                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ILD, status post right VATS and wedge
 biopsy.  Postoperative evaluation for pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 The study is read in conjunction with chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of
 a right pleural tube and presence of very small right apical pneumothorax
 status post VATS and wedge biopsy.  There is a hematoma in the mid lung and an
 adjacent suture line is seen, presumably at the site of wedge biopsy.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of significant pleural effusion or
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is normal.  Median sternotomy wires are
 unchanged in position compared to prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax and right mid lung hematoma
 status post right VATS and wedge biopsy.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 significant pleural effusion.
