                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with repositioning of endotracheal tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has been retracted now terminating in standard position,
 with tip approximately 5.6 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube has been
 advanced, coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, with tip off the inferior
 borders of the film.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There has been interval re-expansion of the left lung with
 residual hazy opacity in the left mid and upper lung fields, perhaps residual
 atelectasis or re-expansion pulmonary edema.  Right lung is grossly clear
 without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval withdrawal of the endotracheal tube with tip now in standard
 position.  Re-expansion of the left lung and resolution of previously noted
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures.
 2. Enteric tube in standard position.
 3. Residual hazy opacity in the left upper and midlung fields may reflect
 atelectasis and/or mild re-expansion pulmonary edema.
