                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with malfunctioning ppm  // PPM lead placment,
 r/o acute process      PPM lead placment, r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs there are no prior chest radiographs available
 for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy for mitral and tricuspid valve replacements.
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no
 edema or pleural effusion.
 
 3 transvenous cardiac leads are continuous from the left pectoral generator: 
 A right atrial lead follows the expected course, a right ventricular pacer
 defibrillator lead  terminates higher than usually seen along the anterior
 wall of the right ventricle, and a left ventricular lead runs extremely close
 to the prosthetic tricuspid valve. The shielding of one of the leads, the left
 ventricular lead believe, is mildly separated in the left anterior chest wall,
 at the level of the second anterior interspace.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  More information about the intracardiac course of the
 leads can be obtained from gated chest CT. Intravenous contrast agent need not
 be administered.
