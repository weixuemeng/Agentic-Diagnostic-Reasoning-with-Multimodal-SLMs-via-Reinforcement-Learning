  1.  Severe emphysema without acute abnormality.
  
  2.  8 mm nodular opacity within the left lung apex.  Shallow oblique views are
  recommended to assess if this is a true nodule versus a summation of shadows
  or rib end.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, continued shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There are emphysematous changes
 again noted, severe in extent.  8 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left
 lung apex is new compared to the prior study, but could reflect the end of the
 left 1st rib or a summation of shadows.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle on
 the left posteriorly likely is due to chronic pleural thickening.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are present.  Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the
 right upper quadrant the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Severe emphysema without acute abnormality.
 
 2.  8 mm nodular opacity within the left lung apex.  Shallow oblique views are
 recommended to assess if this is a true nodule versus a summation of shadows
 or rib end.
