                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with Hodgkin's lymphoma fever and lethargy. 
 Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, heart is increased in size and is
 accompanied by a new pulmonary vascular congestion, as well as new
 heterogeneous opacities in the right lung with both alveolar and interstitial
 features.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new.  Known
 intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is seen to better detail on prior PET-CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are new.  Asymmetrically
 distributed heterogeneous opacities in the right lung could reflect infectious
 pneumonia or an asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema.  If the
 diagnosis is in doubt clinically, short-term followup radiographs after
 diuresis may be helpful.
