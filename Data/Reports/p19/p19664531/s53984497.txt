                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, neutropenia  // Eval Pneumonia, Eval CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly appears slightly improved compared to the prior study. 
 Dense aortic valvular calcifications are re- demonstrated.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is slightly improved compared to
 the previous chest radiograph.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly
 increased on the right and similar on the left.  More focal patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There arm mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Embolization coils are noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval, with
 slightly increased small right, and unchanged left, small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy opacities in lung bases, potentially atelectasis.
