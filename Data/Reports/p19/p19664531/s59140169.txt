                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p fall, evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable. The lungs are hyperinflated. In comparison to chest x-ray ___, the right upper lobe opacity has resolved.  There is persistent
 hazy airspace opacity at the right lung base.  In addition, there is interval
 worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion and probable early mild pulmonary
 edema.  There is no new focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Trace pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Coarsened interstitial markings, likely pulmonary vascular congestion and
 probable early or mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Interval near-resolution of right upper lobe opacity.
 3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
