                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset right-sided back pain with coarse rhonchi on exam. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia/abscess or obvious fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, which
 may represent combination of atelectasis and very small pleural effusion. 
 Also, at the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm is apparent slight
 focal concavity or lobulation of the diaphragm, which may represent adjacent
 airspace opacity or normal contour of the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with question of possible peripheral
 right lower lobe opacity, which may represent infection in the right clinical
 setting.
