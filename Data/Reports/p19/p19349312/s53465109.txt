                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG and pericardial window  // eval for ptx
 s/p CT removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the left heart border is less well defined and the
 degree of left base opacity may be slightly more pronounced. Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change. No CHF. Aside from platelike atelectasis,
 the right lung and right costophrenic sulcus are clear. Sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal/ left lung clips noted.
