 postop changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been removed.
 Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again seen, more prominent on the left in
 the retrocardiac region.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests pleural
 thickening or small effusion on this side.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
 mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
