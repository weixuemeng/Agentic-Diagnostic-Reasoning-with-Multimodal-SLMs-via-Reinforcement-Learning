 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is re- demonstrated. 
 Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation to indicate pneumonia.
