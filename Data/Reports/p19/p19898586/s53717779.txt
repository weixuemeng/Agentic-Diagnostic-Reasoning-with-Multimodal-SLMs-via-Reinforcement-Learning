                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis and left lower lobe crackles.  Concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate  bibasilar opacities
 right greater than left.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right are likely atelectasis. 
 In the proper clinical setting, this can represent pneumonia.
