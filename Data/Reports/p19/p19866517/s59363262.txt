                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Delirium.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device that appears unchanged.  A
 dual-lumen catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction, as before.  There
 is a PICC line coursing into the superior vena cava whose distal course is not
 well delineated on this examination, although it probably terminates in the
 superior vena cava.  The patient has been extubated and an orogastric tube
 removed.  The heart is moderately enlarged, as before.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  Lung volumes are decreased and there is a
 new mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality with perihilar fullness
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Persistent opacification of the left lung
 base has improved.  It is difficult to exclude a pleural effusion on the left
 side.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post extubation.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary
 edema.  Persistent left basilar opacification, but somewhat improved.
