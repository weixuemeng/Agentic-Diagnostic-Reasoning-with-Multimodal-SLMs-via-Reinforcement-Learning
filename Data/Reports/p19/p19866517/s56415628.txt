                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a perihilar increase in density of the lung parenchyma, right more than
 left.  The distribution of these changes, notably combine to the cardiomegaly
 of the patient, are more consistent with pulmonary edema than with pneumonia. 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusions.  Normal appearance of the hilar and
 mediastinal contours.  Right central venous access line and left Port-A-Cath
 in situ.
