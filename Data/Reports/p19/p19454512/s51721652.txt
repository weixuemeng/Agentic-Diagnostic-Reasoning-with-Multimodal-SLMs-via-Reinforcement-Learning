                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___ and more recent chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged, as before.  The aortic
 arch is calcified.  There is similar marked relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left side.  There are mild interstitial changes
 which suggest slight fluid overload or pulmonary congestion.  Particularly
 evident on the lateral view are posterior opacities along the elevated right
 hemidiaphragm which are suggestive of associated atelectasis.  It is difficult
 to exclude trace pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips
 project over the right upper quadrant.  Multiple air-fluid levels are seen
 within bowel including the colon but without dilatation.  Vague opacity in the
 left mid lung appears unchanged and suggests minor atelectasis or scarring. 
 There is mild rightward convex curvature along the thoracic spine.  The bones
 may be demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  
 
 2.  Patchy left mid lower lung opacities that appear unchanged and suggest
 minor atelectasis or scarring.  
 
 3.  Similar severe elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 4.  Air-fluid levels in bowel of the upper abdomen, a non-specific pattern.
