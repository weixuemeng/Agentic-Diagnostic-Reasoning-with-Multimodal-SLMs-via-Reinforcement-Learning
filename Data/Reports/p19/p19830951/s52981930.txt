                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Diastolic congestive heart failure  , followup of the
 patient with cough and history of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged.  Prominence of the pulmonary artery is
 noted, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Upper zone
 redistribution is demonstrated, although demonstrates improvement from
 interstitial pulmonary edema seen on the prior study.  Minimal amount of
 bilateral pleural effusion is noted.  No overt consolidation to suggest
 infectious process seen.
