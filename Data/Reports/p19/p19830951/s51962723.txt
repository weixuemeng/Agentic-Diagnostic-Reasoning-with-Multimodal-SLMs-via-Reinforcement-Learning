  1.  Low lung volumes with bilateral small pleural effusions.
  
  2.  Increased right upper lobe opacity may reflect developing pneumonia in the
  appropriate clinical setting or atelectasis. Short-term interval follow-up
  after therapy, and recommend dedicated chest CT to further evaluate for
  obstructing lesion if clinical concern is high, particularly given history of
  right upper extremity swelling, if no interval resolution.  One could also
  compare with the CT Chest from ___, which I am unable to retrieve on PACS at
  the time of this dictation.
  
  3. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis and/or concurrent infection.
  
  4.  Increased (>___%) loss of vertebral body height of a lumbar vertebral body
  (perhaps L3), progressed since ___.  Correlate with focal exam findings
  and consider cross sectional imaging to further evaluate.
  
  5.  Prominent pulmonary artery may reflect sequelae of chronic pulmonary
  hypertension.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting with right hand swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Reference is made to the
 thoracic and lumbar spine CT exams dated ___ as well as chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low with bronchovascular crowding, but have improved since
 ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis, similar the prior exam, although concurrent infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with
 mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Aortic knob calcifications are moderate,
 overall unchanged. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is overall unchanged.
 There appears to be significant compression deformity and marked loss of
 vertebral body height of an upper lumbar spine vertebral body, not clearly
 appreciated of prior chest radiograph and may correspond to the L3 compression
 deformity on the lumbar spine CT from ___, but has progressed in the
 interim.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with bilateral small pleural effusions.
 
 2. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis and/or concurrent infection.
 
 3 increased (>___%) loss of vertebral body height of a lumbar vertebral body
 (perhaps L3), progressed since ___.  Correlate with focal exam findings
 and consider cross sectional imaging to further evaluate.
 
 4.  Prominent pulmonary artery may reflect sequelae of chronic pulmonary
 hypertension.
