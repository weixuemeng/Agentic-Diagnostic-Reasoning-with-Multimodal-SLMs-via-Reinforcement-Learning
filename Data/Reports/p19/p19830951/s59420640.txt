 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with acute renal failure presenting with
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. Mild cardiomegaly is
 again noted with partially layering bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe
 compressive atelectasis. Additionally there is hilar engorgement compatible
 with edema. Given the lower lung opacity, pneumonia difficult to exclude.
 Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. There is no pneumothorax.  Imaged
 osseous structures appear intact. There is a calcific density abutting the
 left humeral head concerning for tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema with small bilateral effusions and lower lobe compressive
 atelectasis. Pneumonia in the lower lungs difficult to exclude in the right
 clinical setting. Followup imaging post diuresis may be helpful to further
 assess.
