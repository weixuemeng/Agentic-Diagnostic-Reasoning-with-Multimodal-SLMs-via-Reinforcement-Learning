                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Upper extremity and facial swelling.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. The main pulmonary artery contour,
 as well as central pulmonary arteries appear again enlarged. The aortic arch
 is calcified. There is a small pleural effusion on the left with associated
 opacity probably due to atelectasis. The opacity in the medial right lower
 lung is probably due to a atelectasis in the costophrenic sulcus. There is
 probably a very mild degree of vascular congestion but less striking than on
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Cardiomegaly and marked enlargement of central pulmonary arteries; pulmonary
 vascular congestion appears very mild, however. Opacities at the lung bases
 probably due to atelectasis with a small left-sided pleural effusion.
