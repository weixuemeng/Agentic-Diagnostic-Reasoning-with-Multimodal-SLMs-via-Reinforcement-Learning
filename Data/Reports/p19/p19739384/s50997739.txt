                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ETT placement and head bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An ET tube is noted with tip approximately 3.7
 cm above the carina in appropriate position.  A feeding tube is noted to pass
 below the diaphragm with side holes and tip not clearly visualized.  Study is
 limited by patient body habitus.  Additionally, portions of the left
 hemithorax are excluded from the field of view.  Within these limitations,
 bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  Underpenetrated study limits evaluation for edema or focal
 consolidations.  Cardiac silhouette appears accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 No acute rib fractures are identified.  If there is clinical concern for rib
 fractures, then a dedicated rib series can be obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process within limitations as noted above.
 Recommend follow up imaging at full inspiration when the patient is stable. 
 2.  ET tube in appropriate position.
