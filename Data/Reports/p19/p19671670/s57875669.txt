                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right scapular pain and history of prior
 compression fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with underlying emphysematous changes. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 detected. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  Surgical suture material
 along the right medial upper lung is seen.
 
 This study is not optimized for evaluation of the scapula; no acute bony
 findings are seen.  Old L1 compression fracture is noted.  There has been
 interval compression of T4, age indeterminate but new since prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Emphysema without radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Although no acute bony findings are detected on these views, if there is
 high clinical suspicion for scapular or rib pathology, CT is more sensitive.
 3.  Age indeterminate compresion fracture of T4, new since ___.  This
 updated finding was e-mailed to the ___ QA nurses on ___ after attending
 radiologist review.  This finding was also reported to Dr. ___, ___
 ___ attending, by Dr. ___ by phone at 6:58 p.m. on ___ after attending
 radiologist review.
