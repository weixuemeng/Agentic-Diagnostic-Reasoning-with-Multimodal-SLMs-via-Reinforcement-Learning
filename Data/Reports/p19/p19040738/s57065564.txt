 INDICATION:  ___M s/p traumatic head injury with SDH, SAH, nondisplaced
 fracture of R mastoid bone, nondisplaced fracture of posterior TMJ,
 nondisplaced fracture of frontal bone, and incidental segmental LLL PE now s/p
 R hemicraniectomy for elevated ICPs.  // S/p open trach   PEG
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval insertion of a tracheostomy in good position.  The right-sided
 subclavian line is good position at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Previous mild to moderate pulmonary edema has slightly increased since the
 prior.   Moderate right pleural effusion and some right lower lobe atelectasis
 are stable.  Small left pleural effusion is presumed.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval insertion of tracheostomy in standard position; no complications.
 
 Interval worsening of the moderate pulmonary edema.  Stable bilateral pleural
 effusions and basal opacities.
