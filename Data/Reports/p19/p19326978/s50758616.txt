 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:26 AM
  No focal consolidation.
  
  Interval increase in rightward deviation of the trachea, as compared to chest
  radiograph from ___, suggesting interval increase in size of the
  thyroid gland, with increased mass effect on the trachea. This could be
  further assessed with non urgent thyroid ultrasound.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with slurred speech, ataxic upon waking, left sided
 CN deficits  // source of altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung bases are underpenetrated, likely due to overlying soft tissue. 
 Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  There
 is rightward deviation of the trachea with apparent mass effect on the
 trachea, increased as compared to the prior study, which may be due to
 underlying enlargement of the thyroid gland.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.
 
 Interval increase in rightward deviation of the trachea, as compared to chest
 radiograph from ___, suggesting interval increase in size of the
 thyroid gland, with increased mass effect on the trachea. This could be
 further assessed with non urgent thyroid ultrasound.
