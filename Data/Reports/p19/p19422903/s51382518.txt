                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectases are larger on the right side.  There is
 no pneumothorax or large effusion.  4 mm nodule projecting in the superior
 left perihilar region could be a vessel seen on end.  Followup after
 resolution of the acute symptoms with chest x-ray is recommended to exclude a
 lung nodule.  There is kyphosis and moderate degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
