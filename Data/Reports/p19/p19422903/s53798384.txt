                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AFib, CHF, new white count and O2 requirement, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 There is background hyperinflation, with flattening of diaphragms, suggesting
 COPD.  There is increased density in the lower lobe posteriorly on the lateral
 view, which appears new compared with ___, and could represent a pneumonic
 infiltrate.  The possibility of some associated pleural fluid accounting for
 this appearance cannot be excluded.  Some patchy opacity at both bases is
 noted on the frontal view.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 prominence of interstitial markings which could reflect mild CHF.  No gross
 effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Background COPD.  
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly, unchanged. Possible mild CHF.
 
 3.  New lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonic infiltrate.  Possible
 small associated effusion.
