                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with increased seizure frequency.  Assess for
 aspiration or infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes persist without focal consolidation.  Retrocardiac
 region is incompletely assessed due to obscuration by battery pack of neural
 stimulator.  Crowding of the vasculature and increased interstitial markings
 is seemingly unchanged from multiple previous examinations, likely secondary
 to crowding due to low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
