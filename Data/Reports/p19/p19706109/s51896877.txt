                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status  // assess for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain extremely low resulting crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  This fact, in addition to patient body habitus, severely limit
 the sensitivity of this examination for the detection of subtle pneumonia. 
 Within this limitation, there is no lobar consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or overt pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 similar to the prior examination.  A vagal nerve stimulator overlies the left
 chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extremely limited examination without evidence for large consolidation.
