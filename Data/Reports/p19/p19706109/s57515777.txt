                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A vagal stimulator device overlies the left
 chest wall.  Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is limited secondary to
 overlying soft tissue attenuation due to patient body habitus.  Lung volumes
 are low.  No obvious consolidation is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or large pleural effusions.  The lateral view is extremely limited due to
 patient's arm-down position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to patient body habitus and positioning,
 though no obvious acute cardiopulmonary process.
