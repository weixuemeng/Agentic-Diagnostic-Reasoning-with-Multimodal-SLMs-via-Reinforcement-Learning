                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain, redness, and swelling around the patient's VNS device.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting assessment and accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures.  Within the limitations, there is no evidence of a
 focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A VNS device overlies the left mid
 chest.  The VNS device that was overlying the left upper chest has been
 removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
