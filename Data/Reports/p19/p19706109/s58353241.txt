                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and change in neurologic status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are limited due to patient's
 inability to raise the arm as well as body habitus.  Allowing for this, there
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Lung volumes are low and there is no
 large pleural effusion.  Overlying vagal stimulator is again noted.
