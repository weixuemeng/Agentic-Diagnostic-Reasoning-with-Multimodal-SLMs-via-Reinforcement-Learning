                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure, cough and congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are very low.  Within that limitation, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged.  There is
 apparent asymmetric opacification of the right lung, particularly in the right
 lower lung, but somewhat hazy lung fields bilaterally, with increased density
 at the right lung base, although the study is very limited.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing evidence for pneumonia or aspiration on very
 limited study.  Hazy opacities and patchy opacities at the lung bases may be
 due to mild vascular congestion and minor atelectasis.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs are suggested with better inspiration, if feasible, in the event
 that respiratory symptoms were to persist.
