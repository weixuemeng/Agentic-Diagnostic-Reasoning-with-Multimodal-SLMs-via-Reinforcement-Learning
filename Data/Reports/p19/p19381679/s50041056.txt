                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left rib pain after fall. Evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen. The lungs are clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. There is no
 pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No displaced rib fracture is seen. However,
 the PA and lateral chest radiograph is insensitive for the detection of subtle
 rib fractures. If there is continued clinical concern, consider obtaining
 dedicated rib series.
