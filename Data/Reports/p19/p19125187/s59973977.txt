                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with re-positioned PICC line.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study of ___ at 12:30 p.m.  
 
 A portable semi-upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the proximal right
 atrium near the cavoatrial junction.  Pullback of additional 2 cm to position
 it above the cavoatrial junction would be recommended and was conveyed by Dr.
 ___ to ___, the IV nurse, at 2:50 p.m. on ___ by phone 1 minute
 after discovery.  Lung volumes are diminished and there is increasing opacity
 at both bases, left greater than right, which may reflect atelectasis,
 although developing pneumonia particularly at the left base should be
 considered. Crowding of the vasculature is seen, but there is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are difficult to assess given the low lung volumes.  No large effusions.
