                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cirrhosis p/w AMS.  // R/O pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been
 no significant interval change. Low lung volumes results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 overt pulmonary edema. The mediastinum is mildly widened, likely secondary to
 patient positioning. Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac
 silhouette is stable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Significant degenerative changes are noted at the left
 acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially normal chest radiograph
