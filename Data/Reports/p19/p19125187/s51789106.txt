                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe cirrhosis and likely pneumonia on
 outside hospital chest x-ray, now hypoxic.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed earlier the same
 day at___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Extremely low lung volumes are
 seen, limiting evaluation.  Dense retrocardiac opacity could, however, be due
 to infection or atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, but this is
 likely in part due to low lung volumes.  Prominence of the right suprahilar
 region could be due to low inspiratory effort and prominence of the
 mediastinum; however, attention to this area is suggested on future exams.
