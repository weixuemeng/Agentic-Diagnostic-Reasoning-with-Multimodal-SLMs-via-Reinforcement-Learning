                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cirrhosis, septic shock.  Please evaluate for Dobbhoff
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the
 body of the stomach.  The lung volumes are low, with persistent mild
 cardiomegaly.  There is bilateral perihilar vascular congestion with slight
 interval increase in mild-to-moderate bilateral pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are persistent.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  The right IJ appears to terminate in the mid
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff terminates below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the
 stomach.
 
 2.  Interval increase in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
