                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, hypotension, tachycardia, concern for
 sepsis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ obtained at an outside
 institution, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result
 appearing mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is similar.  The hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  There are patchy opacities in the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Previously
 described nodules seen on chest CT are not visualized on the current exam.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study as result of low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
