                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right upper lobe opacity, history of
 cancer, status post right lower lobectomy in ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT ___, chest radiographs ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  A focal
 consolidation in the right upper lobe is associated with thickening of the
 right minor fissure.  The opacity has become slightly more radiopaque since
 the preceding exam days ago.  No additional consolidations, nodules, effusion,
 or pneumothorax is present.  Post-operative pleural thickening at the right
 costophrenic angle is unchanged.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increased size of right upper lobe opacity
 associated with adjacent pleural reaction.  Although the short-interval
 evolution suggests an infectious process, chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by
 telephone at noon on ___.
