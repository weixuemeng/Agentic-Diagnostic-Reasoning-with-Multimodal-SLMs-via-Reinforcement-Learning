                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with persisting cough for three months,
 subjective chills, status post right lower lung resection for lung cancer in
 ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is stable after prior right lower lobectomy.  Distal to periphery of R
 hilum, new parenchymal patchy opacities are seen just above slightly thickened
 minor fissure.  No effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New non-specific right upper lobe parenchymal opacity associated
 with a thickened minor fissure.  Repeat chest radiographs could be obtained in
 ___ weeks after trial of treatment for a potential infectious etiology.  If no
 resolution, further evaluation is warranted, especially given the patients
 history of prior neoplasia.
