 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with lupus and lung cancer following

 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Right pleural scarring is stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is
 probably no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal, although the
 configuration of the left heart border raises the possibility of left atrial
 enlargement, but there has been no interval change and the pulmonary and
 mediastinal vasculature are normal.
