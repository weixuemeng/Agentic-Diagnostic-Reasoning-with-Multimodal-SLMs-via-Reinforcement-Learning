                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath, fatigue and lethargy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report from chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflective
 of a combination of large pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Heart size cannot
 be assessed due to the presence of the left hemithorax opacification.  Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta are present.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  The right lung is grossly clear.  No
 pneumothorax is noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely due to a combination
 of a large left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  CT of the chest is
 recommended to exclude an obstructing central endobronchial lesion.
