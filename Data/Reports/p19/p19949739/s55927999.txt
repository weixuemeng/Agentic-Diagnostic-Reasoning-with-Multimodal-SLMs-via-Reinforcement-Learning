 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina,
 and a nasogastric tube terminates in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
 in the region of the gastroduodenal junction.  Markedly improved aeration of
 the left lung since the recent study, at which time there was near-complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax.  Left upper lobe has re-expanded as well
 as part of the lingula, but there remains a substantial left lower lobe
 atelectasis as well as a moderate pleural effusion.
