                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are
 slightly lower lung volumes with increased engorgement of dilated pulmonary
 vessels and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, all consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  There are tubes overlying the mediastinum that could well be
 external to the patient.  What appears to be a nasogastric tube extends to the
 stomach, though the side hole is difficult to identify.
