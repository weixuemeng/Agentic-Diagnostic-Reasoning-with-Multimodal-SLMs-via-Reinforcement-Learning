 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  Moderate scoliosis, causing asymmetry of the
 ribcage.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 A band like opacity at the level of the right hilus, and located in the right
 lower lobe, reflects the previously cavitary and peribronchial process
 documented on the CT examination from ___.  Although no direct
 comparison is possible, the process appears small and the cavitary elements
 are no longer visualized.  However, a repeat radiograph would be required for
 thyroid comparison.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
