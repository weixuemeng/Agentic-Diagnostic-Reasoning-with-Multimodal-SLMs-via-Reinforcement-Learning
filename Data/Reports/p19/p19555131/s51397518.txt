 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The overall volume of abnormal lung, predominantly in the superior segment of
 the right lower lobe has improved since ___.  There is still extensive
 bronchiectasis and peribronchial infiltration in that region.  There are no
 areas of clear bronchogenic dissemination, but if there is any clinical
 concern for that complication, I would strongly recommend CT scanning.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
