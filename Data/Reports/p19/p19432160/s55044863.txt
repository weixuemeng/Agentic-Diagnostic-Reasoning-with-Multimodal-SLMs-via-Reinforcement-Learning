                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question pneumothorax after right thoracentesis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 7:52 a.m., there is less dense opacification at the
 right lung base, which could reflect interval removal of pleural fluid.  There
 is residual parenchymal and probable residual pleural opacity.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  The left lung is grossly clear except for minimal
 atelectasis at the base and a small effusion.  No CHF.  Sternotomy wires again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Partial interval improvement of opacification at the right base, with residual
 pleural and parenchymal opacity.  No pneumothorax detected.
