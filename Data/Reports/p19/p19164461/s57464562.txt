                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New pacemaker lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the appearance of the single-channel pacemaker lead that extends in the region
 of the apex of the right ventricle.  The device again coils on itself slightly
 posteriorly before extending anteriorly.
 
 The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.  There is some
 increasing opacification at the right base, suggestive of some progressive
 volume loss.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with some
 atelectasis and effusion.  Persistent small effusion at the right base is
 seen.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
