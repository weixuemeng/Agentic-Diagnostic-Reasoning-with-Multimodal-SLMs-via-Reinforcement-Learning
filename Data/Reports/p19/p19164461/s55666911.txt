                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of follicular lymphoma with
 effusions.  Now with pleuritic pain at right base, evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view
 chest examination of ___.  As before, there is borderline heart
 size.  Considering that the patient has a marked chronic COPD and emphysema
 present the heart size suggests the possibility of some chronic CHF which can
 represent the presently existing small bilateral pleural effusions blunting
 the lateral pleural sinuses and extending in the depending posterior pleural
 space as noted on the lateral view.  Comparison of the frontal views also
 suggests a diffusely present perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation is
 more marked than it was on the previous study one week ago.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Comparison with the previous study does not demonstrate any new
 discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate that may represent pneumonia.
 
 Similar as shown on previous examinations, there is status post distal left
 clavicular fracture and displacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Bilateral moderate amount of pleural effusions probably related to chronic
 CHF.  No pneumothorax.  Comparison with the next previous portable chest
 examination, progression of CHF signs in the form of perivascular haze in the
 pulmonary circulation.
