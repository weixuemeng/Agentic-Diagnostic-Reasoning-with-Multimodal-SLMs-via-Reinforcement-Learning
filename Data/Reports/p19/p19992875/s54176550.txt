                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with severe liver disease, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is small right pleural effusion. 
 Right lung base opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Linear opacity in the
 left lower lung zone, likely represents plate-like atelectasis.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is new since ___ due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small right pleural effusion.  Right lung base opacity, most likely
 atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion new since ___.  Consider
 cardiac ultrasound for further assessment.
