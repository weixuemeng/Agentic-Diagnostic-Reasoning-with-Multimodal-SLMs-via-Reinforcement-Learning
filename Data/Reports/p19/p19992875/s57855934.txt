                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Persistent crescentic focal
 opacity is noted within the left lower lobe, which could reflect an area of
 infection or atelectasis.  Minimal streaky opacities elsewhere in both lung
 bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild paraseptal emphysematous changes are noted in the
 lung apices.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent crescentic area of opacification within the left lower lobe which
 may reflect an area of infection or atelectasis.
