                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old post chest tube removal, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 242.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable cardiac enlargement.  There is right basilar and lateral pleural
 thickening with associated patchy basilar airspace disease which could reflect
 atelectasis.  There has been interval removal of the left chest tubes with
 residual patchy basilar opacity likely representing areas of atelectasis. 
 Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax given the presence of an area of focal
 lucency at the apex. Follow up imaging is advised. No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
