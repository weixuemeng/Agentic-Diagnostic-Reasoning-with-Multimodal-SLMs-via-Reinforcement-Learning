                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of left-sided rib pain for two to three days. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  Lung volumes are back to normal.  The left ribs
 show no clearly identifiable abnormalities, the left chest wall is
 unremarkable.  In the periphery of the left lung, two areas of minimal
 peripheral non-characteristic scarring are seen.  A blunting of the basal
 aspects of the left heart contour is likely caused by a fat pad.
 
 Unremarkable right lung.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
 
 
 Bilateral symmetrical apical thickening.
