 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 722

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 AP portable upright chest film ___ at 722 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable cardiac enlargement and stable mediastinal contours.  There
 continue to be bilateral pleural effusions with associated patchy and linear
 opacities at the right base and more focal airspace consolidation at the left
 base.  These findings may represent atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Previously seen lucency at the left apex is no longer seen.  No pneumothorax
 is appreciated.  There are some bullous cystic changes at both apices
 consistent with known paraseptal emphysema seen on recent CT study of
 ___.
