                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative confusion, to assess for aspiration or atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  No recent images presented.  There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion.  Opacification in the
 retrocardiac region with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic
 angle is consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and left lower
 lung volume loss.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
