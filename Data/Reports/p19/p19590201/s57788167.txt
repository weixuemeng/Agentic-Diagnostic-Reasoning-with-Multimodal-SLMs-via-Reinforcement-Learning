                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with status post trauma of anterior chest one
 week ago, now presenting with left pleuritic rib pain.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is clear.  There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic recess in the lateral view without clear fluid meniscus
 suggesting pleural effusion.  Otherwise, the rest of the lung fields are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the left costophrenic recess in the lateral view
 without a clear fluid meniscus is concerning for parenchymal opacity of the
 left lower lobe.  This may represent inflammation/infection versus lung
 contusion.  Clinical correlation is advised.
