                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 much better inspiration.  Previously described opacification at the bases has
 cleared.  On the lateral view, there is the vague suggestion of retrocardiac
 opacification overlying the spine.  However, this is not confirmed on the
 frontal projection.  The appearance could reflect some fibrotic change from
 previous consolidation.  In the appropriate clinical setting, a developing
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
