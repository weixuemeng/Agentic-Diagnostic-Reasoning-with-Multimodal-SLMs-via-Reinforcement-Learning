 CHEST TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs appear clear of confluent consolidation. 
 There is mild blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, potentially a
 small effusion versus atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of consolidation or other findings to explain
 patient's chest pain.  Possible tiny pleural effusion.
