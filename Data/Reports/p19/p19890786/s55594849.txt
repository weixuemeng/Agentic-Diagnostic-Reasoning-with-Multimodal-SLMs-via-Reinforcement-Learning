                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with radiation therapy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are innumerable
 metastatic nodules involving both lungs with consolidative process involving
 the right lower lung, associated with pleural effusions.  It would be
 impossible to exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia given the
 extensive underlying lung disease.
 
 The known metastatic lesions involving the inferior scapula and nondisplaced
 fracture of the right posterior eighth rib are not identified on this study.
