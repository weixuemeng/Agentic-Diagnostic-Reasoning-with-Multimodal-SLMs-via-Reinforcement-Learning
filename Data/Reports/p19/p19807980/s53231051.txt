                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac surgery, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the sternotomy wires are in
 unchanged position.  The patient continues to show signs of moderate fluid
 overload and sequela of pulmonary hypertension.  The pre-existing atelectasis
 in the retrocardiac lung regions is unchanged in extent and severity.  A
 co-existing pneumonia at this anatomical location cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.  No larger pleural effusions.
