                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary congestion, to assess for consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there may be mild improvement of
 the substantial fluid overload and sequela of pulmonary hypertension.  The
 retrocardiac opacification persists consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and there are bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it is impossible to exclude supervening
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
