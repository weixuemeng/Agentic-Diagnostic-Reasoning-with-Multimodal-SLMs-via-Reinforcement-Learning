                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:53
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myasthenia ___, concern for
 increasing bleeding.  Evaluate for evolution of hemothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:43.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___, at 10:53 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the right basilar pigtail catheter.  There is a layering
 right pleural effusion and likely a smaller left effusion with some associated
 airspace disease, likely reflecting patchy atelectasis, although bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Overall, the size of the right-sided effusion
 does not appear to be significantly changed since ___.  Lungs are
 otherwise without evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult
 to assess due to the bibasilar airspace process.
