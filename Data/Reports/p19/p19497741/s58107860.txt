                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip projects over the low trachea approximately
 2.5 cm above the carina.  An esophageal catheter traverses below the diaphragm
 with tip projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. 
 There is a small left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacity at right cardiophrenic
 angle and vertical stranding at left base medially most likely represents
 atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected
 on this single view.  Heart size is top normal.  Aortic tortuosity is seen
 with otherwise normal mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip projecting over the low trachea.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis or scarring. Attention to right cardiophrenic angle
 opacity is recommended to exclude early infiltrate.
