                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracostomy tube for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day at 5:40 a.m., right-sided chest tube has
 been placed.  There has been considerable reexpansion of the right lung.  A
 small residual right pneumothorax may still be present, given lucency seen in
 the right cardiophrenic region. Superiorly, however, the lung edge abuts the
 chest wall.  ? slight overall volume loss of the right lung, though this
 appearance may be accentuated by slight patient rotation.
 
 Again seen is the right IJ catheter with tip at SVC/RA junction.  Also again
 seen is an ET tube tip 19 mm above the carina, borderline low.  An NG tube is
 present, tip and side port over gastric fundus.  
 
 The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. 
 The left lung is grossly clear except for minimal atelectasis/scarring at the
 left lung base.  No gross effusion identified on either side.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of right chest tube with considerable, likely near-
 complete, reexpansion of the right lung.  Lucency at the right lung base
 raises the question of possible small residual pneumothorax.
 2.  Minimal atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base.
 3.  ET tube ~19 mm above the carina, borderline low.  Clinical correlation
 requested.
