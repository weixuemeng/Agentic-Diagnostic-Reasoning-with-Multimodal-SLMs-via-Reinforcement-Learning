                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, status post chest tubes, now falling hematocrit,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the right-sided chest tube are in unchanged position. 
 There could be a mild bilateral increase in extent of the pre-existing pleural
 effusions.  As a consequence, a mild increase in extent of the bilateral basal
 areas of atelectasis is seen.  Close radiographic monitoring seems indicated.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
