                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumothorax after chest
 tube placement with still dropping hematocrit.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 on ___ at 5 p.m.
 
 The pigtail catheter is in place as well as the right chest tube.  There is no
 interval progression of pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Left
 retrocardiac consolidation and left pleural effusion are unchanged.  Mild
 vascular engorgement is noted and progressed since the prior study and is
 consistent with new interstitial pulmonary edema.
