                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 9:52
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year-old with cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacity in the right medial lung base with associated air bronchograms
 and corresponding to the right middle lobe location on the lateral view. 
 These findings are more suggestive of bronchiectasis in a patient with a
 history of recurrent pneumonia, although an acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  Comparison to prior studies and clinical correlation is advised. 
 The remaining lungs are clear.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Blunting of both
 posterior costophrenic angles may reflect small effusions or chronic pleural
 thickening.  No acute bony abnormality.  Followup imaging should be based on
 the clinical assessment.
