                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Overall there is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Als, there is patchy right upper lobe opacity which
 could relate to prominent vascular structures, but underlying consolidation
 may be present.  Stable left base atelectasis/scarring is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggests fluid overload.  Additional patchy right upper lobe opacity could
 relate to prominent vessels although underlying infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
