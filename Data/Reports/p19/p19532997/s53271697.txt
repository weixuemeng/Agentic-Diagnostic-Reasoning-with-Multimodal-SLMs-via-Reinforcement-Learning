                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with renal cell carcinoma status post
 pericardial window.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously visualized endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have
 since been removed.  Again visualized is evidence of nodular pleural
 thickening bilaterally but more prominent on the right in keeping with pleural
 metastases. Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and
 moderate on the left, persist.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged and suggestive of a persistant pericardial effusion but
 stable.  
 
 Retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity persists and is likely representative
 of a combination of the left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis. 
 There is, however, no evidence of new consolidation or pneumothoraces.
