  Persistent left basilar opacity, suggesting increased pleural effusion with
  atelectasis or possibly pneumonia, increased since two weeks ago but difficult
  to compare to more recent studies.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Abandoned pacer leads projecting over the left lateral chest wall
 anteriorly appear unchanged.  A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the
 right ventricle, as before.  Moderate globular cardiac enlargement is similar.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is persistent left
 basilar opacification that may probably reflect a small-to-moderate effusion
 with increased opacification of the left lower lobe, which is nonspecific as
 to etiology.  Although the opacity may consist of a combination of atelectasis
 and pleural effusion, a pneumonic consolidation is noted excluded.  There is
 no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion on the right side.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  Cholecystectomy
 clips project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification in the left lower lobe, which may
 primarily reflect an increase in pleural effusion but extensive atelectasis or
 pneumonic consolidation are additional possibilities to consider.
