                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with severe abd pain radiating to back BP ___s  //
 eval ? free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volume is low.  Mild bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to
 atelectasis and/ or small pleural effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The radiograph is labeled as upright, however patient position
 appears supine or semi upright.  Suboptimal patient position limits the
 evaluation for pneumoperitoneum.  Given the limitation, no evidence of large
 pneumoperitoneum is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and/ or small pleural effusions.  No evidence of large
 pneumoperitoneum is identified.  If there is clinical concern for
 pneumoperitoneum, consider repeat radiograph with upright patient position or
 CT.
