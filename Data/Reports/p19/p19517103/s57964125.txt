                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough, SOB  // evaluate for pneumonia,
 effusion       review of OMR heels a history of breast cancer status post
 mastectomy
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___. Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large focal opacity centered in the left lung lingula. The opacity
 appears larger than on a chest x-ray from ___, but is in keeping
 with findings on a chest CT scout film from ___. Compared to the
 previous chest x-ray, there is new linear atelectasis in the right mid zone
 and a new small right pleural effusion, with a small amount of associated
 parenchymal opacity.
 
 Heart size is grossly unchanged, without frank cardiomegaly. The lungs are
 otherwise grossly clear, without other focal opacities, CHF or left-sided
 effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Aside from mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine. Bony structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Large opacity in the left lingula consistent with known masslike
 consolidationsseen on previous x-rays and CTs, but with interval enlargement
 compared with ___ chest x-ray. The most likely differential is a
 progressive organizing pneumonia or aggressive fungal infection. Neoplasm
 could also account for this appearance, but is considered less likely given
 relatively rapid progression. The patient has apparently undergone
 transbronchial biopsy of this lesion. Please see biopsy results for further
 assessment.
 2. New small right pleural effusion with small area of focal opacity adjacent
 to it. This is new compared with the ___ radiograph and appears to
 progressed slightly compared with the ___ CT scan. Attention to
 this area on followup films is recommended to exclude developing new focus of
 infiltrate or progressive effusion.
