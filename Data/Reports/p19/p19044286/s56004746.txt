                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle collision, sternal fracture and rib
 fractures and right pneumothorax status post chest rube decompression, please
 evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal PA and lateral chest views were read in comparison with
 prior chest radiographs through ___, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This study technique is not designed for evaluation of ribs. However, within
 the limitations, I could appreciate, cortical break in posterior aspect of
 right upper ribs, suggesting fractures, but, dedicated rib viess are
 recommended for detailed analysis. There is no appreciable pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion. Lungs are clear. Heart size is top normal.  Hilar and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
