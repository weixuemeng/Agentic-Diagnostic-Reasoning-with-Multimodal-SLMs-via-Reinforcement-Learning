 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, crackles in lungs, rhinorrhea. no
 fever. never smoker. h/o CHF  // r/o pulm edema or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ chest and left shoulder radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  In comparison to prior study, missing short segment
 of the right posterior fifth rib,  left acromioclavicular joint
 osteoarthritis, and bilateral glenohumeral joint arthritis are again seen;
 however, there is increased lucency and thinning of the posterior seventh rib
 when compared to most recent ___ chest radiograph that may represent
 worsening osteoporosis given patient's debilitated and wheelchair-bound state.
 There are no sclerotic bone lesions noted.
 There is mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 cephalization of pulmonary vessels without overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 subsegmental atelectasis are also noted.  No pneumothorax seen.  Old fracture
 of the right fifth posterior rib unchanged from prior chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly, fluid overload,  without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Stable osteoarthritis of the bilateral glenohumeral joint, severe left
 acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, increased lucency of the
 ribs(particularly the right seventh posterior rib) that may represent
 worsening osteoporosis in a debilitated and wheelchair-bound patient.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Recommend CT scan if there is clinical suspicion for
 malignancy or pathological fractures.
