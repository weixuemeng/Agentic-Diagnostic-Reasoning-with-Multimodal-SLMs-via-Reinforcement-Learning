                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pressure and shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is similar patchy opacification at the left lung
 base, probably involving the left lower lobe with left lateral pleural
 thickening.  A smooth defect along the course of the right posterior fifth rib
 appears unchanged.  The right lung remains clear aside from patchy unchanged
 right infrahilar opacity, again suggesting minor atelectasis or scarring. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chronic-appearing findings including left basilar scarring
 and pleural thickening; no definite evidence of pneumonia.
