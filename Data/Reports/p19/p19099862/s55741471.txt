  1. No evidence for esophageal rupture.
  2. 3.9 cm rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base is unchanged
  from ___. Again, nonemergent chest CT is recommended for full evaluation.
  3. New patchy opacities at the left lung base and a vague opacity in the left
  upper lung are non-specific, especially in the setting of suspected underlying
  mass, and may reflect pneumonia or aspiration with supporting clinical
  evidence.  These could further assessed at the time of cross-sectional
  imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Melena and lightheadedness. Rule out esophageal rupture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 A 3.9 cm rounded opacity again projects over the right lung base and is
 unchanged from ___.  There are new patchy bibasilar opacities,
 worse at the left lung base, and a more vague opacity in the left upper lung
 which may represent pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting. There is
 engorgement of the central vasculature without strong evidence for pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence for esophageal rupture.
 2. 3.9 cm rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base is unchanged
 from ___. Again, chest CT is recommended for full evaluation.
 3. New patchy opacities at the left lung base and a vague opacity in the left
 upper lung are non-specific, especially in the setting of suspected underlying
 mass, and may reflect pneumonia or aspiration with supporting clinical
 evidence.  These could further assessed at the time of cross-sectional
 imaging.
