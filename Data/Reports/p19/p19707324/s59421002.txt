                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AV block s/p dual-chamber pacemaker via L
 cephalic vein  // lead position, pneumothorax      lead position, pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 19:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 08:50 are submitted.  The
 lateral view is suboptimal due to overlying motion artifact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a dual lead left-sided pacing device with the leads
 terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively.  The heart remains stably enlarged. There is stable
 enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The interstitium is more prominent as compared to ___ which suggests superimposed mild interstitial edema. Clinical correlation
 is recommended. Status post median sternotomy. No pneumothorax. Minimal
 blunting of both costophrenic angles may reflect tiny effusions or pleural
 thickening.
