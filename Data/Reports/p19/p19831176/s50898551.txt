                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with no known PMH presents with AMS, nausea and vomiting,
 found with large IVH with extension to the ___ ventricle intubated s/p EVD
 placement  // interval change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Lung volumes are moderately low, accounting for some of the apparent increase
 in mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour reflects a tortuous or dilated
 ascending thoracic aorta which, in turn, raises question spot the aortic
 valve.  Pulmonary vasculature remains engorged and there is probably mild
 edema asymmetrically distributed in the left lung.
 
 Left lower lobe previously densely consolidated, probably due to collapse, has
 partially re-expanded.  Milder right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened, and
 the right main bronchus is now occluded with secretions.  Small pleural
 effusions are likely, but there is no pneumothorax.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the
 stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical attention to retained secretions.
