  No definite focal consolidation is seen on the frontal view, although on the
  lateral view, there is a somewhat rounded opacity projecting over the lower
  lobe posteriorly, overlying the anterior aspect of 2 lower thoracic vertebral
  bodies.  While findings could relate to osseous degenerative change,
  underlying pulmonary lesion not excluded. Recommend follow-up chest CT for
  further assessment.
