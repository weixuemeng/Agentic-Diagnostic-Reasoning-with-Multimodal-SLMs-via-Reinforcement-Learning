                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of intermittent
 confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the right which distorts the mediastinum/hilum.  Given this, the
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is likely tortuous.  Hila
 difficult to assess due to patient positioning.  Dual-lead left-sided
 pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The battery pack of the pacemaker obscures the
 left mid lung.  There may be left mid to lower lung atelectasis, hard to
 exclude underlying early consolidation due to the above factors.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
