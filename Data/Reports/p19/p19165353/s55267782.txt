                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fevers, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  A pre-existing opacity at
 both the left and the right lung base has decreased in extent, several small
 areas of plate-like atelectasis are seen on the current image.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
