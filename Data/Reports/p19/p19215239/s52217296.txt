                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with the clinical
 diagnosis of ARDS.  Supervening pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema can certainly
 not be excluded.
