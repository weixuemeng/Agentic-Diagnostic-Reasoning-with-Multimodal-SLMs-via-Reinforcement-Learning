                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Interval evaluation, patient with pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed.  When compared to the
 prior study, there has been interval increase of diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications that are worse on the right.  Opacifications obscure the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours that are otherwise normal.  The costophrenic
 angles are clear and there is no pneumothorax.  The soft tissues and bones are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent
 with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.  Considering the extent of the
 disease, pneumonia with a component of ARDS has to be considered.
