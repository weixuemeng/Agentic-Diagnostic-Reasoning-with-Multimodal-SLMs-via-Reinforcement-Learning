 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 1:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with likely malignant partial bowel
 obstruction, nasogastric tube placed for persistent nausea and emesis, please
 evaluate position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film of ___ at 1:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the
 expected location of the stomach.  The proximal portion of bilateral ureteral
 stents are seen.  There is a small layering right effusion with no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Stable 2-3 mm calcified nodule in the right upper lobe likely
 representing a granuloma.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable, given differences in positioning between studies.  Note that
 the patient's mandible obscures portion of the apices.
