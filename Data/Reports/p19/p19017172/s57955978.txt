                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increased cough for 3 months, pain in the right
 anterior ribs, and wheezing.  Evaluate for pneumonia or lung cancer changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs the test chest dated ___ through ___, as well as is CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate persistent large
 right perihilar mass, which is slightly larger as compared to the prior study.
 This is in a region of prior fiducial seed placement, and may correspond to
 post-radiation changes; however, recurrence of malignancy cannot be excluded. 
 Again seen are heterogeneous opacities at the right base, with a small
 right-sided pleural effusion.  The left lung is essentially clear.   The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax
 or focal consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent large right perihilar mass, which is slightly larger as compared
 to the prior study.  This is in a region of prior fiducial seed placement, and
 may correspond to post-radiation changes; however, recurrence of malignancy
 cannot be excluded. Recommend dedicated CT of the chest for additional
 evaluation.
 
 2.  No pneumonia.
