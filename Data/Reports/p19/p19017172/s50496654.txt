                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Atrial fibrillation, advanced lung cancer,
 bronchiectasis, weight gain and suspected pulmonary edema.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right hilar mass and fiducial markers are corresponding to known lung cancer. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable.  There is obliteration of
 the right costophrenic sulcus, overall unchanged since the prior study.  As
 compared to prior imaging there is slight interval increase in interstitial
 opacities bilaterally that potentially might reflect interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Surgical fracture of the sixth left rib is unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  No interval development of substantial pleural effusion is seen.
