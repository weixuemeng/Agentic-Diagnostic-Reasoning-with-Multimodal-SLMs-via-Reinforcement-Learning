                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Low lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  There is
 retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  This could be
 accounted for by atelectasis given lower lung volumes on the current exam
 noting that effusion or consolidation cannot be excluded.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the
 osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to low inspiratory effort.  Retrocardiac opacity
 may be due to atelectasis; however, effusion or consolidation also possible. 
 Repeat with PA and lateral could offer additional detail if patient is
 amenable.
