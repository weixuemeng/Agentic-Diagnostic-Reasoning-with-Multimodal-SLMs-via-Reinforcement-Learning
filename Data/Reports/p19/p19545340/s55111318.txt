                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view may reflect chronic
 pleural thickening.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 atelectatic changes are noted within the left lung base.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.
