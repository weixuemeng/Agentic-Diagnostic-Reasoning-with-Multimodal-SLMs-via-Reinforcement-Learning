 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, hypotension, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed
 mild fluid overload and a likely small left pleural effusion.  At both lung
 bases, there are areas of subsequent atelectasis.  However, coexisting
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No
 pneumothorax.  The right upper lung is normal.
