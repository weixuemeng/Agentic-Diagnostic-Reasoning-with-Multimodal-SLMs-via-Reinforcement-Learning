                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with left foot gangrene, febrile, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart contour
 is slightly exaggerated by the low lung volumes but is still mildly enlarged. 
 There is also venous congestion with a prominent azygous vein and
 redistribution of the pulmonary vessels which is compatible with a mild volume
 overload without evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with new mild volume overload without
 significant pulmonary edema.
