                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with known head and neck carcinoma, now
 presenting with fever, though no cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right-sided central venous catheter
 terminates in the region of the right atrium. Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Hyperdense nodules within the mediastinum likely reflect prior
 granulomatous disease.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The
 lateral view is difficult to evaluate given the arm-down positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided central venous catheter terminating in the region of the right
 atrium
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly
