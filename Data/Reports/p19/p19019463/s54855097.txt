                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent right-sided thoracentesis.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval decrease in
 right-sided pleural effusion, now small.  Residual linear opacification within
 the right lower lung likely represents atelectasis.  Similar findings are
 noted on the left.  Stable right upper lung mass better evaluated on recent CT
 chest.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion, now small in
 size.  Small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Stable right
 upper lung mass.  No pneumothorax.
