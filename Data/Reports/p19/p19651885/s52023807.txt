                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemothorax ___ sympathectomy now s/p chest
 tube removal with bleeding from chest tube site  // eval for pneumothorax    
 eval for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I am not sure whether projecting just above the level of the left axillary
 generator there is a left pneumothorax or an obliquely oriented margin of
 denser lung inferiorly due to previous left pleural drain, since removed.  
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is unchanged.  Small left
 pleural effusion or pleural thickening is presumed.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic but there is no longer any vascular congestion.  A large band of
 slowly resolving consolidation persists in the right lower Lung. No right
 pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion.
 Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right ventricular
 pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placements, continuous
 from the left axillary generator.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  I recommend conventional radiographs on ___ for
 reassessment of possible left pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 9:29 AM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
