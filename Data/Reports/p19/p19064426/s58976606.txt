                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Long smoking history and suspected lung mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Apical
 scarring, bilateral, is overall stable as compared to prior examination.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 If clinically warranted, further assessment with chest CT might be considered
 to exclude the possibility of radiographically occult lesion.
