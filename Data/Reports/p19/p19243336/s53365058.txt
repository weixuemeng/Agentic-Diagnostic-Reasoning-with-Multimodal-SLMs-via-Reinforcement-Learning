 less prominent as compared to the prior study given differences in technique. 
 There are scattered areas of mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen along with possibly
 fluid in the minor fissure.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Persistent enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Mediastinal contours are grossly stable to possibly
