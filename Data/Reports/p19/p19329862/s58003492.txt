 Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged from the prior study.  The mediastinal
 contours are similar.  Mild pulmonary edema is not substantially changed from
 the prior study.  Hilar contours are similar.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Splenic shadow appears absent compatible with history of
 sickle cell disease.  Vertebral bodies have a somewhat H-shaped configuration
 also compatible with a history of sickle cell disease.

 Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema, similar to that seen
