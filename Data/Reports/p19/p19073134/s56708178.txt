                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, cough, COPD.  Reports being diagnosed with
 pneumonia at an outside facility.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle bibasilar opacities seen on the frontal view, not substantiated on the
 lateral view, may be due to atelectasis and overlying vascular structures
 although a residual pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Comparison with prior would be helpful for further evaluation in
 this patient reportedly being diagnosed with pneumonia at an outside facility.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Aortic knob calcification is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 There is moderate to severe compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body of indeterminate age.  Correlate clinically and for acuity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle bibasilar including left base retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view,
 not substantiated on the lateral view, may be due to atelectasis and overlying
 vascular structures, although residual pneumonia is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting in this patient is recently diagnosed with
 pneumonia.  Comparison with prior radiographs would be helpful.
 
 Moderate to severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body of
 indeterminate age.  Correlate clinically for acuity.
