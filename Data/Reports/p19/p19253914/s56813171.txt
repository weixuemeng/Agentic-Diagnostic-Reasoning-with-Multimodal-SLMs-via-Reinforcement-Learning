 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 Tip of the new right internal jugular line is near the estimated location of
 the cavoatrial junction.  Widened upper mediastinum, due to large thyroid and
 tortuous vessels is unchanged and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size top normal. Bilateral low lung volumes due to very elevated
 hemidiaphragms, particularly the right, is reflected in vascular crowding and
 mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no consolidation.
