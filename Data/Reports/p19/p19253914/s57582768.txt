                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of diabetes, now with severe
 hypoglycemia and prior hospitalization with pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, obscuring
 assessment of the heart and mediastinal structures.   An ovoid structure in
 the upper portion of the right mediastinum likely represents a vascular
 structure.  Additionally, the remaining visualized portion of the lungs
 demonstrates crowding of the bronchovascular structures and interstitial
 prominence, likely reflecting some degree of pulmonary edema.  Lateral view
 demonstrates no appreciable pleural effusion. Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases are noted, likely atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. No
 pneumothorax seen in this upright radiograph.  Severe degenerative changes are
 present at the right glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints with a probable
 chronic rotator cuff injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar
 atelectasis - underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
