                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male initially presenting with sepsis, now requiring
 assessment for an infectious source.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate massive elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm, reducing lung volume to one-third of the original
 volume.  There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, as well, which is
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding at the base.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia or other focal infectious process on this exam.  There is some
 tortuosity to the aorta.  Bowel loops are seen interposed between the
 diaphragm and the liver. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Massive elevation of the right hemidiaphragm reducing the right
 lung to the one-third of its original volume.  No evidence of pneumonia or
 other focal infection.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone at the time they
 were discovered at 3:04 p.m. on ___.
