                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate tortuosity of the aorta.  There is moderate-to-severe
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as before.  Streaky
 opacification associated with the elevated right hemidiaphragm would be
 compatible with chronic atelectasis.  In addition, however, there is medial
 left basilar streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region, for which atelectasis
 could be considered versus pneumonia in the appropriate setting.  Lastly,
 there is a focal new left mid lung opaciy, potentially a focus of
 bronchopneumonia.  Background mild interstitial abnormality is unchanged and
 may be associated with slight congestion, although atypical infection could be
 considered in the appropriate setting.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left mid and lower lobe opacities, concerning for
 bronchopneumonia in the appropriate setting.  Similar marked elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm; streaky opacification in the right lower lobe is
 compatible with associated atelectasis although infection is hard to exclude
 particularly since there is no direct prior comparison for the lateral view.
