                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:36 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with newly placed orogastric tube, bilateral
 femoral lines and endotracheal tube, check position.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 20:35.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 12:36 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet
 approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Lung volumes have somewhat
 improved and there continue to be some streaky opacities at both bases which
 could reflect areas of atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia should also
 be considered.  There is likely a layering left effusion.  The perihilar
 vasculature is somewhat prominent, but there is no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given supine technique.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
