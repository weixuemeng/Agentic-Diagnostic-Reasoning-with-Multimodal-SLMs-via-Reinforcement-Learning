                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 20:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intubation, check tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:51.
 
 Portable supine chest from ___ at 20:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip at the
 thoracic inlet.  Lung volumes are somewhat lower, and there is crowding of the
 vasculature.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities which may reflect patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 overt pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
