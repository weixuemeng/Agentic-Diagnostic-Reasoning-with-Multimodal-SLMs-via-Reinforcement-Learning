                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ at 21:47 from ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are somewhat low
 in volume with increased prominence of interstitial markings and fullness of
 the mediastinal vessels compatible with mild-to-moderate congestive failure. 
 Retrocardiac opacity persists from the previous study and could reflect
 atelectasis, though concurrent pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  Trace
 pleural effusions are likely also present without pneumothorax.  Cardiac size
 remains moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is improved from the prior
 evening's film. Retrocardiac opacity can be better assessed with radiograph
 after diuresis.
