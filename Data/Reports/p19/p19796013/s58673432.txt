                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with influenza and
 superimposed pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line tip
 is at the level of superior SVC.  The right PICC line tip is at the level of
 mid-to-low SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are overall stable.  Although
 substantially involved by bilateral opacities, the overall aeration of the
 lungs has improved since the prior examination.
