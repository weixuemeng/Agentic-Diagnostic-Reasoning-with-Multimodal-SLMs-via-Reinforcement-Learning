 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been slightly advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects 6.6 cm above the
 carina.  The tube could be advanced by another 1-2 cm.  The other monitoring
 and support devices are in unchanged position.  Unchanged appearance of the
 relatively extensive right and the smaller left parenchymal opacities. 
 Unchanged extent of the known right pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 and mild retrocardiac atelectasis persist.  No new focal parenchymal
 opacities.
