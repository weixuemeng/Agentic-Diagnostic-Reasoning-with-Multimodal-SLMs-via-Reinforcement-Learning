 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary
 edema.  The endotracheal tube projects with its tip 6 cm above the carina. 
 The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip is not included in
 the image.  The right PICC line is in correct position.  There are widespread
 bilateral severe parenchymal opacities and consolidation, right much more than
 left, some of which have a nodular component, notably in the right upper lobe.
 There appears to be a small right pleural effusion.  No left pleural effusion.
 No pneumothorax.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
