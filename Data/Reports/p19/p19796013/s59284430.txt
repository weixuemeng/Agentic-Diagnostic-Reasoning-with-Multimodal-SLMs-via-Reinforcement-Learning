                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Tracheostomy is in stable position.  Heart
 size and upper mediastinal contours are stable.  Widening of the upper
 mediastinum is likely a combination of lymphadenopathy and azyos engorgement. 
 Right lung multifocal consolidation and pleural thickening have slightly
 increased since the prior exam with increased fluid in the right major
 fissure.  Less severe consolidations in the left lung are similar to prior.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in bilateral multifocal consolidations and right
 pleural fluid.
