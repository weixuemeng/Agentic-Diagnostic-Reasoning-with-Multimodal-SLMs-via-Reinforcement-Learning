                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy, dyspnea, crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CTA and chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The aorta
 remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Lung volumes are lower compared to
 the prior study.  There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Retrocardiac opacification is present, with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 left greater than right noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with widening of the AP diameter suggestive of underlying COPD. 
 Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with multiple remote rib
 fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2. Retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is not
 excluded.
