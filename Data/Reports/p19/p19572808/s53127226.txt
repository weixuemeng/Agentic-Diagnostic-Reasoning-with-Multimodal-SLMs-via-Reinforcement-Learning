 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dizziness  // eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Clips are noted in the left
 axilla.  There is subtle consolidation in the left lower lung which is
 concerning for an early pneumonia.  Subtle opacity at the right lung base may
 also represent a focus of pneumonia versus atelectasis.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity in the left lower lung and right lung base concerning for early
 pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
