                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper extremity injury, hand in wood chipper.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Given
 this, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
