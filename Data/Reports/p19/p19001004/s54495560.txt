                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Urosepsis.  Arrives on vent.  Please assess ETT placement and
 left subclavian line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided
 subclavian venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  Enteric catheter
 courses below the left hemidiaphragm terminating in the body of stomach. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Left lung base
 opacification is poorly assessed given patient positioning, but may reflect
 combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Underlying infectious process cannot
 be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Medical support devices are well positioned.  Left lower lung
 opacification evident.
