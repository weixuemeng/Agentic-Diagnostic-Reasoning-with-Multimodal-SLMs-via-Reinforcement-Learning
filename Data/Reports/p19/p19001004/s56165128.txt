                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  For ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube is approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 extends well into the stomach and right subclavian catheter tip is in the
 mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
 
 Continued low lung volumes which may account for some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration
 of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and
 effusion.
