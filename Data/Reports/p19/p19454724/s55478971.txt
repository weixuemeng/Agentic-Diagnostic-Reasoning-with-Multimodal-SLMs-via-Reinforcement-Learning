                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for change in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Bilateral chest tubes are directed superiorly.  An endotracheal tube
 is 8 cm above the carina and should be advanced for proper positioning. 
 Enteric tube terminates within the stomach.  A right subclavian catheter
 terminates in the upper SVC.  
 
 There is a small right apical pneumothorax and probable small left
 pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is collapse of the left
 lower lobe.  Capping of the left apex may represent pleural fluid or
 extrapleural hematoma.  
 
 Multiple right rib fractures and bilateral scapular fractures are better seen
 on the trauma CT torso.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pneumothoraces.  
 2.  ET tube terminates 8 cm above the carina and could be advanced several cm
 for optimal positioning.
 3.  Multiple right rib fractures and bilateral scapular fractures again seen.
 4.  Left apical cap, which could reflect pleural fluid or extrapleural
 hematoma. Correlation with outside CT findings recommended.
 
 Findings #1 and #2 were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:36 on ___ via telephone.
