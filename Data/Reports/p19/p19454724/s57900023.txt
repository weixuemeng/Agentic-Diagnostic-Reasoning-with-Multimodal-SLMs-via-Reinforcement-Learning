                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 07:45
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left effusion and followup for
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 05:29.
 
 Portable AP view of the chest on ___ at 7:45 am is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart appears stably enlarged given differences in positioning and
 technique between studies.  Overall mediastinal contours are stable.  There is
 worsening interstitial and airspace disease with more consolidative appearance
 in the bases.  These findings most likely reflect worsening pulmonary edema,
 although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  There are
 likely bilateral layering effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated. 
 Bilateral scapular fractures are again seen.  The known rib fractures are not
 as well appreciated on the current examination.
