 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has
 been removed.  There is no safe evidence for the presence of a right
 pneumothorax.  The patient remains intubated and the nasogastric tube as well
 as the left subclavian access line are unchanged.  The pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities and moderate cardiomegaly as well as the known multiple
 partly displaced rib and scapular fractures are constant in appearance.
