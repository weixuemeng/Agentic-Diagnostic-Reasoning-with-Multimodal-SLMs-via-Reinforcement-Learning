 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:32 PM
  Very low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar
  atelectasis and probable small left pleural effusion.  Right internal jugular
  central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Enteric tube courses
  into the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ampullary mass s/p whipple  // post-op     
 post-op
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs.  Study is read in conjunction
 with a chest CT on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium close to the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Mediastinal widening is probably a combination of
 extremely low lung volumes and venous engorgement.  Chest CT on ___
 showed no adenopathy and the absence of leftward displacement of the trachea
 argues against a mediastinal hematoma.  Heart size is normal.  Left infrahilar
 opacification is probably atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
