                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p whipple on ___ complicated by delayed
 gastric emptying, now with productive cough  // Please evaluate for possible
 pulmonary process (pna/pulmonary edema/atelectasis).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate improved lung volumes
 relative to prior examination.  An enteric tube descends the thorax in an
 uncomplicated course, its tip not well visualized though appears to course
 below the level of the hemidiaphragm.  A right PICC terminates at or just
 below the superior vena cava.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar borders are within
 normal limits.  A retrocardiac opacity is new relative to prior examination
 for which infection is difficult to exclude.  Bibasilar atelectasis is most
 pronounced within the left lower lobe.  There is a small pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac opacity for which infection cannot be excluded.  A small left
 pleural effusion is associated with atelectasis.
