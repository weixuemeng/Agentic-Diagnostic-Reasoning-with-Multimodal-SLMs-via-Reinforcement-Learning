                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post partial nephrectomy three days ago, now with
 increasing oxygen requirement and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain low.  There is interval improved aeration
 at the bilateral lung bases from the most recent prior study.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions  and evidence of elevated central venous pressure persist. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  There is persistent mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, related in part to low lung
 volumes and technique, but stable.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  Subcutaneous emphysema is
 redemonstrated over the right supraclavicular region.  Degenerative changes at
 the bilateral acromioclavicular joints are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration at the bilateral lung bases with mild persistent
 atelectasis.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and evidence of elevated central venous
 pressure.
