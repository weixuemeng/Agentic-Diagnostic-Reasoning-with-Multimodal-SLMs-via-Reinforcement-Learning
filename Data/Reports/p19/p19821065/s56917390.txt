                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation, shortness of breath, questionable new
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and mild bilateral
 symmetrical enlargement of the hilar structures, likely caused by enlargement
 of the pulmonary arteries.  There is massive soft tissue overlay on today's
 image, causing overall increased radiodensity of the lung parenchyma. 
 However, there is no indication for an acute process such as pulmonary edema
 or pneumonia.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis might be present.  No
 pneumothorax.
