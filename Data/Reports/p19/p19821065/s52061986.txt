                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  COPD, atelectasis, and GNR in sputum.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.  
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is stable,
 suggests pulmonary hypertension.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Bilateral inferior perihilar opacities are unchanged from prior
 study.  These could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot
 be totally excluded.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
