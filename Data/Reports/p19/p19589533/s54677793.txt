                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Slight opacity
 projecting over the inferolateral right lower lung on the frontal view may
 relate to scarring or atelectasis, not substantiated on the lateral view. 
 Small rounded opacities projecting over the bilateral lower thorax at the same
 level bilaterally are most consistent with nipple shadows.  The left lung is
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with slight inferolateral opacity
 seen on the frontal view, not well substantiated on the lateral view, may be
 due to underlying scarring/atelectasis.  Otherwise, no focal consolidation
 seen.
