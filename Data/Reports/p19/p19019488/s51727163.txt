 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  A fluid level is seen
 within the dilated appearing distal esophagus, which may be due to distal
 stricture or dysmotility.  There is increased opacity at the bilateral lung
 bases.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  There is a compression
 deformity of mid thoracic vertebral body, of unknown chronicity.  No
 radiopaque foreign bodies are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Fluid level in the dilated esophagus, concerning for distal stricture or
 dysmotility. Consider esophagram or chest CT to further assess. 
 2.  Bibasilar pulmonary opacities concerning for aspiration.
