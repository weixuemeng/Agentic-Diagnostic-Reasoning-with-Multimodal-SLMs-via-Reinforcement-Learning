                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:13 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma and respiratory infection after
 bronchitis for pneumonitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with
 a chest CTA on ___:
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Vague increase in radiodensity
 in the left lower lung could be due to retained secretions or hemorrhage. 
 Small lung lesions evident on the chest CT are barely visible on bedside
 radiographs.  It would be sensible to obtain PA and lateral paired
 conventional chest radiographs, and presuming the CT findings are visible, use
 conventional radiographs as a means of monitoring progression.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
