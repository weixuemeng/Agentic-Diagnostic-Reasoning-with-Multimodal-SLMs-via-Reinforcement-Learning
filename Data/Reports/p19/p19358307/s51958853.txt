                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis persists.  There is a small area of
 increased opacification just lateral to the left border of the cardiac
 silhouette.  This could possibly represent a focus of consolidation.
 
 On the lateral view, there are bilateral pleural effusions.
