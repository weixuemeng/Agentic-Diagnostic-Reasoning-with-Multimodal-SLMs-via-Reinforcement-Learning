                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Extensive cardiac history, restrictive lung disease, recent
 admission for cough, dyspnea, now concern for left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___ and a CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unchanged mediastinal,
 hilar, and cardiac contours.  Bibasilar opacifications are again evident with
 minimally improved aeration on the left. Overall, radiograph is relatively
 unchanged compared to scout image obtained as part of a ___ chest
 CT, at which time, the opacifications were most consistent with atelectasis. 
 No new opacifications evident.  A right-sided pacemaker has leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Abandoned pacer leads are also
 identified in the left chest.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right.  Findings
 similar to ___ CT, at which point, opacities corresponded with
 atelectasis.
