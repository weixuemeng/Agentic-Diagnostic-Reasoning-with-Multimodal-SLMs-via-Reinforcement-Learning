 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with pain/swelling after fall  // r/o fx
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy wires
 noted.  Right chest wall AICD is again noted with leads extending into the
 region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Abandoned left-sided leads
 are noted.  There is opacity at the left mid and lower lung, slightly improved
 from prior though likely reflects persistent left effusion and basal
 atelectasis.  Right lung is partially obscured by pacer device.  Right lung
 appears grossly clear.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes partially imaged
 at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left mid and lower lung opacity which is concerning for atelectasis
 and pleural effusion.  Minimal improvement compared with prior.  No fracture.
