                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of CHF, restrictive lung disease
 and recent pneumonia with increased shortness of breath for past week,
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show a mild left lower lobe opacity.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are normal.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  A right-sided pacer
 terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Abandoned
 leads are noted within the left chest.  Sternal wires are intact.  Clips
 suggest prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or pneumonia with an
 associated effusion.
