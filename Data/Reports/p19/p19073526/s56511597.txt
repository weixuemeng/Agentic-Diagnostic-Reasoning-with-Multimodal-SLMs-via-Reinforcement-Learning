                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the prior
 study, with associated improved aeration at both lung bases.  Residual patchy
 opacities are present in the left retrocardiac region.  Focal linear scar
 versus atelectasis within the lingula appears unchanged.  Heart is upper
 limits of normal in size, and ICD pacing leads are unchanged in position, a
 right-sided pacer as well as abandoned leads from previous left-sided device. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.  Curvilinear
 calcifications along the anterior cardiac border on lateral view correspond to
 a known calcified left ventricular aneurysm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Improved aeration at lung bases with residual patchy left lower lobe
 opacity remaining.
 
 2.  Calcified left ventricular aneurysm.
