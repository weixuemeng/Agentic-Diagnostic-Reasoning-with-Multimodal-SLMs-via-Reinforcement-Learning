  Stable cardiomegaly and cardiac pacing hardware. Low lung volumes accentuate
  the pulmonary vasculature, which appears mildly congested. No evidence of
  pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacification may represent
  atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M, ___ type 2 diabetes, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p cabg and PCI,
 systolic CHF, stage II CKD, hyperkalemia, Afib on A/C, PR prolongation and
 IVCD LBBB type, s/p biV ICD upgrade, chronic anemia, directly admitted for
 initiation of amiodarone. Appears clinically improved, but want CXR for
 monitoring of interval change.  // Evidence of pulmonary edema?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery. ICD
 pacing leads are unchanged in position including abandoned leads. Stable mild
 cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure. Lung volumes remain
 low. Pleural and parenchymal scarring in the left mid and lower lung are
 unchanged since ___, but a new patchy left retrocardiac opacity is
 noted .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy left retrocardiac opacity which may reflect patchy atelectasis,
 aspiration, or a developing pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
