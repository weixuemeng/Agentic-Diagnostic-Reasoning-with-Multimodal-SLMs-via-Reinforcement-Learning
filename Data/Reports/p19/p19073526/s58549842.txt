                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath, pulmonary edema  // ___
 year old man with shortness of breath, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, appearances are very similar when compared to the prior study.  Lung
 volumes remain low with a moderate left pleural effusion and left basal
 airspace opacity.  This is likely due to atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.  The right lung appears grossly clear.  A right chest wall pacemaker
 is unchanged in appearance.  Leads from a previously removed pacemaker also
 seen.  No pneumothorax seen.  Mild prominence of the bilateral hila and
 pulmonary vasculature is similar in degree when compared to the prior study
 and consistent with a degree of congestive heart failure.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
