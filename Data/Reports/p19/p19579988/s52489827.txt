                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:03 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with small bowel obstruction versus ileus,
 intubated; check location of tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 4:28.
 
 Single portable supine chest film, ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lung volumes remain markedly diminished with crowding of the vasculature
 and probable patchy areas of atelectasis.  Overall, the pulmonary vascularity
 appears somewhat more well defined suggestive of resolving pulmonary edema. 
 More focal opacity at the left base may reflect lower lobe atelectasis,
 although a pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2.5-3
 cm above the carina.
