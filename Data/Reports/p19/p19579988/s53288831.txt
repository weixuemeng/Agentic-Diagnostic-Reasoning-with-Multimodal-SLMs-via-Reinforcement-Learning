                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Assess ET tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP view of the chest is obtained.  Patient rotated
 to the right, which significantly limits evaluation.  The endotracheal tube is
 seen with its tip located just above the carina.  Recommend slight retraction
 for more optimal position.  Lung volumes are low.  An NG tube courses into the
 left upper abdomen, tip excluded from view.  Bibasilar atelectasis present. 
 No large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low position of ET tube, retraction by at least 2 cm is advised. 
 NG tube positioned appropriately.
