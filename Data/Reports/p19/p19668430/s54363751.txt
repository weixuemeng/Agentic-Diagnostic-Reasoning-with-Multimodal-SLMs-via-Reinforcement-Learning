                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for free air in a patient with abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities may represent atelectasis. 
 Correlate with clinical picture to exclude pneumonia.
 2.  No free air under the diaphragm
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
