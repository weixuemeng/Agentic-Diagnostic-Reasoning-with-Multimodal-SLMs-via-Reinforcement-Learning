                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again,
 bilateral pleural plaques are extensive obscuring the lung fields and it is
 somewhat difficult to discern whether there is new focal consolidation,
 although none is definitely seen.  Slight blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles in the right costophrenic angle may be due to pleural
 thickening, although a trace right pleural effusion is difficult to entirely
 exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified
 and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral pleural plaques suggest prior asbestos
 exposure and partially obscure the lung fields making it difficult to
 accurately discern whether there is underlying new underlying opacities,
 though no definite new focal consolidation.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.
