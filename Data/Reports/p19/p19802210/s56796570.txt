                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously present right lower lobe consolidation has nearly
 resolved.  A small amount of residual consolidation is present in the superior
 segment right lower lobe.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Widespread calcified pleural plaques are again demonstrated. 
 Interval decrease in size of small right pleural effusion with residual small
 effusion remaining.  No substantial left pleural effusion.  Lungs are
 hyperexpanded suggestive of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in right lower lobe pneumonia with residual
 focus of opacity in the superior segment.  Additional followup chest x-ray in
 four weeks is suggested to document complete resolution.  At that time, a
 small right residual pleural effusion can be re-assessed for resolution as
 well.
