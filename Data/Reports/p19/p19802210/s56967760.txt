                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough, fever and dyspnea.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes. 
 Extensive calcified pleural plaques are seen bilaterally.  Blunting of
 costophrenic angles may reflect small pleural effusions or pleural thickening.
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Tortuosity of the
 descending aorta is noted.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Rounded opacities are seen bilaterally, which may represent pulmonary nodules.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Round bilateral opacities, may represent pulmonary nodules.  Further
 assessment with CT is recommended.
 
 3.  Diffuse bilateral pleural calcifications, compatible with asbestos
 exposure.
 
 4.  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, suggestive of small pleural
 effusions or pleural thickening.
