                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure and history of dilated
 cardiomyopathy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___ and concurrent
 chest CT.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates 5.4
 cm above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm with the tip in the stomach.  Consolidation within the right base
 may reflect aspiration or pneumonia, and is better characterized on concurrent
 CT.  Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm suggests probable basilar
 atelectasis.  The upper lungs are clear.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Moderately severe cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard position of lines and tubes.
 2.  Bibasilar consolidation which suggests atelectasis, though right base
 concerning for possible aspiration or pneumonia on concurrent CT.
 3.  Stable moderately severe cardiomegaly.
