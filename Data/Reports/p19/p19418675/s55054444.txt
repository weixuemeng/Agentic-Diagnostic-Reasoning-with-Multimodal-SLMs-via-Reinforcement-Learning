                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly appears relatively unchanged compared to the
 prior exam.  Mild pulmonary edema is present, slightly improved compared to
 the prior study.  Ill-defined opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.  Small
 pleural effusions are noted bilaterally.  No pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure, improved when compared to the
 prior study, with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Ill-defined opacities at
 lung bases may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult
 to exclude.
