 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:57 PM
  
  1. Right arm PICC with distal tip projecting over the low SVC.  EKG leads
  overlie the chest.
  2. There is mild cardiomegaly.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
  prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggestive of pulmonary venous
  congestion.  There is likely left basilar atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude a
  small left pleural effusion.  No sizable right pleural effusion.  No
  pneumothorax.  No new focal lung consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC, appears to be dislodged  // assess
 PICC position      assess PICC position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___, supplemented by chest
 CT ___.
 
 Bilateral hilar enlargement has increased since ___, combination of
 baseline pulmonary artery enlargement, probable central adenopathy, and acute
 increase in caliber of both hilar pulmonary arteries and the crossing
 pulmonary veins.  Other recent vascular changes include mild enlargement of
 the heart, and greater engorgement of upper lobe pulmonary vessels and
 mediastinal veins, all pointing to all due to acute left heart failure. 
 Pulmonary edema if any is limited to the left perihilar lung.  Pleural
 effusion small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
