  1. Standard positioning of endotracheal tube and enteric tube.
  2. Opacification of the right lung base with associated right or mediastinal
  shift concerning for right lower lobe collapse.
  3. Granular opacification of the left lung concerning for aspiration or
  pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with pnuemosepsis tubed, evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates.  4.1 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm and terminates outside of the field of view within
 the stomach.
 
 Dense opacification of the right lung base with associated rightward
 mediastinal shift disc consistent with right lower lobe collapse.  Granular
 opacification of the left mid lung corresponds to airspace opacity seen chest
 CT concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  There is no left-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Chain sutures project over the right
 wall of suggesting prior lobe wedge resection.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is partially obscured by the right basilar opacity.  The osseous
 structures are notable for partially evaluated severe degenerative change of
 the cervical spine.  Known osseous metastatic disease is better evaluated on
 same day CT.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
