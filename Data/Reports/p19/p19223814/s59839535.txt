 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 2:58 AM
  Destruction of the T6/T7 interspace with increased T2/STIR signal and
  postcontrast enhancement extending to the adjacent vertebral bodies with
  partial destruction of the T6 inferior end plate and T7 superior endplate with
  loss of anterior vertebral body height compatible with discitis/osteomyelitis
  complex. There is associated prominent prevertebral enhancing prominent soft
  tissue with trace T2 signal affecting the anterior inferior portion of the T5
  vertebral body. Anterior epidural enhancement from T5-T7 suspicious for small
  component of epidural abscess.  There is exaggerated kyphotic angulation at
  the T6/T7 level with a small amount of retropulsion focally contacting the
  cord but without significant canal stenosis.  Normal cord signal.  Otherwise
  with multilevel non-critical degenerative changes.  Multilevel Tarlov cysts.
  
  Impression: T6/T7 discitis/osteomyelitis with interspace and endplate
  destruction with focal involvement of T5 and probable tiny epidural abscess
  component from T5-T7 along with kyphotic angulation focally contacting the
  spinal cord without compression.  Normal cord signal.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vertigo.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral  chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Most pleural surfaces are
 normal except for posterior thickening probably due to healed left
 posterolateral rib fractures. Midthoracic disc space narrowing is due to
 chronic disc degeneration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
