                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M now former smoker w/prior diagnosis of PNA and pleural
 effusion s/p chest tube, abx now re-presenting for follow-up.  // ?interval
 changes     ?interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.  And subsequent chest radiograph one ___.
 
 Since ___ there has been substantial clearing of complicated abnormalities
 in the right hemi thorax including previous severe atelectasis and pleural
 collections predominantly along the mediastinum.  There is still volume loss
 in the right hemi thorax reflected in rightward shift of the mediastinum,
 particularly the anterior junction, but there is little if any residual juxta
 mediastinal pleural fluid and the Lung abnormality is probably scarring.  Of
 course chest CT scanning would be superior in determining what if any
 significant active pathology persists.
 
 Left lung is clear and there is no left pleural abnormality.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is smaller reflecting that a pericardial effusion was present
 on the previous study.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CT scanning to evaluate residual
 abnormalities and establish a baseline for assessment of any possible
 recurrence
