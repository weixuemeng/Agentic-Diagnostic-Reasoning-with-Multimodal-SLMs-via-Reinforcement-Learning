                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left chest wall
 chest pain, known lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left
 hilar/perihilar opacity corresponds to patient's known perihilar mass, better
 assessed on CT.  Old-appearing rib deformities on the left may relate to prior
 fractures, metastatic disease not excluded, although better evaluated on CT. 
 Extensive vascular calcification is seen projecting over the upper hemithorax
 bilaterally.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left perihilar opacity corresponding to known pulmonary mass
 again seen.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
