 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again, there are low lung volumes.  The patient's chin overlies the right
 apex.  Given the above, the again areas of bilateral mid to lower lung
 atelectasis bilaterally.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the left upper lobe
 again seen is a 6 mm calcific nodule most likely presenting a calcified
 granuloma.  A few smaller rounded calcified nodules are seen projecting over
 the right lung, stable, also likely representing calcified granulomas. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Several areas of likely atelectasis in the mid to lower lung the lungs
 bilaterally, evolving infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
