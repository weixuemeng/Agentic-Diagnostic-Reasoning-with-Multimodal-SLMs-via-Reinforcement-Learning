                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with agitation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar linear opacities likely represent
 atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary vascular prominence, which may be
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Likely calcified nodule seen in the left
 upper lung.  Heart and mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Underlying
 infection is not completely excluded.
