                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, crackles on exam, ascites, pls eval for effusion 
 //
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___. CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.   Previously noted
 nasogastric tube has been removed. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema persists
 with small right pleural effusion. Fissure all fluid on the right likely
 accounts for the triangular peripheral mid lung opacity with probable adjacent
 scarring. The heart mediastinal contours are poorly assessed though appear
 grossly stable from most recent prior exam. The imaged bony structures are
 intact. Embolic material is seen projecting over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially stable exam with right pleural effusion, partially loculated and
 pulmonary edema unchanged.
