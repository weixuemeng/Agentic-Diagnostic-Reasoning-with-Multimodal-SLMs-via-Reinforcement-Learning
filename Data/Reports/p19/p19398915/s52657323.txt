                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, tips-resistant hepatic
 hydrothorax, s/p thoracentesis this AM for recurrent hydrothorax  // evaluate
 for pulmonary edema, persistent right pleural effusion, now s/p 1.7L
 thoracentesis    evaluate for pulmonary edema, persistent right pleural effus
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier on this date, there has been any
 thoracentesis with removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right
 pleural space.  A moderate effusion processed and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The opacification in the left hemithorax is probably more
 prominent than previously, suggesting asymmetric pulmonary edema with possible
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
