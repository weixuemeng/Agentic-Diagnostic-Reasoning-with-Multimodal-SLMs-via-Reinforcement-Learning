                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT from that same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mild to moderately enlarged.  Heterogeneous
 opacification of the left lung appears markedly improved.  Similarly, there
 has been improvement in opacities in the right mid-to-upper lung, probably
 including substantial improvement in the superior segment of the right lower
 lobe.  Patchy opacity layering along the minor fissure suggests atelectasis. 
 A pigtail catheter has been removed.  There is recurrent opacification of the
 right lower hemithorax, probably reflecting pleural effusion, most likely
 moderate in size but difficult to quantify, as well as increasingly dense
 opacification of the right middle lobe suggesting atelectasis or
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal parenchymal opacities suggesting resolving
 pneumonia, but increasing dense opacification of the right lower hemithorax
 suggesting a combination of pleural effusion with atelectasis or potentially
 pneumonia.
