 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  FOR EARLY AM ___ year old man with cirrhosis, recurrent
 right hepatic hydrothorax, hypoxemia, and prominent LUL consolidation of
 unclear etiology, getting bronch ___  // FOR EARLY AM ___ - eval LUL
 opacification, pre-bronchoscopy for ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent and severity of the right
 pleural effusion, combines to areas of relatively extensive right basilar
 atelectasis are unchanged. The extent and severity of the left upper lobe
 parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms has improved but remnant opacities
 in this location are still clearly seen. Likewise, the left lower lung is
 better ventilated but still shows evidence of parenchymal opacities, similar
 in morphology to the left upper lobe. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt
 pulmonary edema persists.
