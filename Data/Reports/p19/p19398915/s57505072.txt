                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate to large right pleural effusion appears similar to the
 recent radiograph with adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in the mid
 and lower lungs. There is no definite pneumothorax.  Widespread airspace
 opacities throughout the left lung have worsened and may reflect a combination
 of asymmetrical edema and pulmonary infection.
