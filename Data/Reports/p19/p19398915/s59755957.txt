                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent thoracentesis, with subsequent hypoxia and pulmonary edema. 
 Evaluate for interval change in right sided opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal mediastinum and
 heart size.  A moderate right pleural effusion has decreased since yesterday,
 with interval improvement in the right middle lobe consolidation.  An opacity
 in the superior right lower lobe is improved, and given this rapid improvement
 likely represented atelectasis or major aspiration which is now resolved. 
 There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia.  The left lung is unchanged, and
 there is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in the right pleural effusion and improvement in the
 right middle lobe consolidation. 
 
 2.  Improvement of a superior right lower lobe opacity, which likely
 represented atelectasis or major aspiration, without convincing evidence of
 pneumonia.
