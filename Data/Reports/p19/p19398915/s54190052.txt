 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post thoracentesis, assess post-drainage residual.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There has been
 interval thoracentesis on the right side with significant decrease in the size
 of the right pleural effusion with only a small residua.  Subtle consolidation
 in the right mid-to-lower lung could represent reexpansion pulmonary edema. 
 Left lung appears grossly clear with probable mild left basilar atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant decrease in right pleural effusion with opacity in
 the right mid-to-low lung likely representing reexpansion pulmonary edema.
