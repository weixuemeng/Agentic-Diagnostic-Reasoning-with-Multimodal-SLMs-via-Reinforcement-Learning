 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval aeration of the right lung apex from ___ with

 right pleural effusion, minimally improved from the prior study.  The left
 lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There is no left
 pulmonary vasculature engorgement or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely assessed due to opacification of
 the right lung.  The trachea remains midline.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval aeration of the right lung apex with minimally improved
