  Satus post right thoracocentesis and pigtail insertion with removal of nearly
  the entire right pleural effusion. Small right apical pneumothorax is noted.
  There are multiple new and increased left sided opacities in a perihilar
  distribution. Given the significant increase in such a short interval, these
  findings are more suggestive of pulmonary edema as opposed to worsening of
  atypical infection.
  
  These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
  the time of discovery at 8:59 pm on ___.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION: st p thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  There is a minimal millimetric pneumothorax after this
 procedure.  The extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially
 decreased, the effusion is almost completely resolved.  A small pleural drain
 is seen projecting over the right costophrenic sinus.
 
 On the left, the diffuse parenchymal opacities, with air bronchograms and
 inhomogeneous distribution, have increased as compared to the previous image. 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
