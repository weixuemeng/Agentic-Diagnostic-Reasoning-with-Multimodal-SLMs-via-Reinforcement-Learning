                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of confusion, presenting with increasing
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval, likely increase in large right-sided
 pleural effusion, given differences in technique.  Underlying consolidation is
 not excluded.  There are patchy opacities projecting over the left
 mid-to-lower lung which could be due to multifocal infection versus less
 likely edema.  The mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are not well assessed
 due to the large right-sided opacity from pleural effusion, however, the right
 aspect of the mediastinum and heart appear unremarkable.  No large left
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in large right pleural effusion, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
 2.  Patchy opacities in the left mid-to-lower lung raise concern for
 multifocal infection, aspiration, edema felt less likely.
