                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube remains in place with a small right apical pneumothorax. There is
 also a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right.  Allowing for slight
 differences in positioning and decreased lung volumes, the extent of fluid is
 not clearly changed.  There is probably some degree of atelectasis at the
 right lung base, as before, although findings are not specific on radiography.
 A TIPS shunt projecting over the right upper quadrant shows some narrowing
 along the mid portion of the stent, similar to the prior findings, and again
 noted are vascular coils projecting over the epigastric region to the left of
 midline as well as patchy calcification in the left upper quadrant.  The left
 lung remains clear with noting a very small pleural effusion only on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes, but other prior probably no significant change.
