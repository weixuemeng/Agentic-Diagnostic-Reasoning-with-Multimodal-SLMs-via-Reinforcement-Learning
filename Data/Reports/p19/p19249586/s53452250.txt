                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, pneumonia and empyema, who
 presents for evaluation of left-sided IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 8:48 a.m., ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left-sided IJ appears to extend posteriorly on the lateral film
 with the tip likely in the azygous vein.  The left-sided chest tube abuts the
 mediastinum and is unchanged in position compared to the prior exam.  There is
 an enteric tube that traverses below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of
 the stomach.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis is also stable.  There is no focal consolidation.  The previously
 noted small left apical pneumothorax is not visualized on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lateral view demonstrates the left-sided IJ coursing posteriorly and
 terminating likely into the azygous vein.
 
 2.  Stable bilateral small pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5:16 p.m. by Dr. ___
 by telephone on the day of the exam.
