                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after liver and kidney transplant with right
 pleural effusion drained by pigtail catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size.  Right basal pleural
 drain unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax.  Lower lung volumes explain in
 part the appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, but there is new engorgement
 and it is difficult to exclude very early edema, but the heart is normal size.
 Mediastinal venous engorgement is minimal.  Feeding tube passes into
 non-distended stomach and out of view.
