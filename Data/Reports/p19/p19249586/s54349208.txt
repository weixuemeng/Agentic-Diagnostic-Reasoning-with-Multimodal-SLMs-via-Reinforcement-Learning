                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Liver and kidney transplant.  Chest tubes removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC as before.
 
 Previous small left basal pneumothorax has resolved.  Small-to-moderate left
 and moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, with fissural components,
 increased substantially since ___, but volume of the right pleural
 effusion may be smaller today than on ___, suggesting interim
 thoracentesis.
 
 Suggestion of a cluster of small ring shadows lateral to the mid portion of
 the left hilus raises the possibility of septic emboli.  Careful followup with
 conventional radiography and repeat CT scanning if necessary would be required
 to assess this possibility.
 
 Heart shadow is not dilated, but is bigger than on ___, could be due in
 part to increased pericardial effusion.  Determination would require
 echocardiography.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:45 p.m.
