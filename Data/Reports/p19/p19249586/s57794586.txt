                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a marked
 decrease in size of right pleural effusion compared to the prior study, with a
 residual small effusion remaining.  Additionally, a small pneumothorax is
 present at the right lung apex.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits, and previously present pulmonary edema has resolved.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity has partially improved and is likely due to atelectasis. 
 Previously moderate left pleural effusion has decreased in size with residual
 small pleural effusion remaining.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased right pleural effusion with residual small effusion and small
 right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis and slight decrease in small left
 pleural effusion.
