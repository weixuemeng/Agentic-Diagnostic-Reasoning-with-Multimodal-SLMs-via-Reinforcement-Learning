                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 812
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, hepatic hydrothorax, status
 post chest tube removal, check for resolution of left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 810.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 812 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of left chest tube.  A focal lucency at the left apex is
 seen which could represent a tiny pocket of air.  Followup imaging would be
 advised.  Subcutaneous emphysema within the left lateral chest wall soft
 tissues.  Streaky opacities at the left base likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis or changes related to recent chest tube removal.  Interval removal
 of the nasogastric tube.  The left internal jugular catheter remains
 unchanged.  A left subclavian PICC line is also unchanged in position.  There
 are small bilateral effusions.  There is residual but improving bilateral
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities at the right base most likely reflect
 patchy atelectasis in the setting of an effusion.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
