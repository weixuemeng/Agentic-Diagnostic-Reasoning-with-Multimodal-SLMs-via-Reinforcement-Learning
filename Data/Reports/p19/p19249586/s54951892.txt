                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chest pigtail drainage catheter in
 place.  Worsening apical pneumothorax reported yesterday.  Assess right
 pleural effusion and right apical pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Similar as on preceding examination of ___, the patient had to be
 examined in sitting position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  The
 right-sided pigtail end catheter remains in unchanged position.  A small
 amount of pleural effusion has further diminished, results in an isolated
 small fluid accumulation in the posterior pleural sinus.  The pigtail end
 catheter is in anterior direction on the right base and this area is
 completely drain free.  The remaining apical pneumothorax cap is minimal in
 size and does not become wider than 1 cm.  Bilateral plate small peripheral
 atelectasis are unchanged and no new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are
 seen.  Previously described left-sided PICC line remains in unchanged
 position.  Osseous defect status post surgical intervention in distal half of
 right-sided clavicle unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further regression of pleural effusion and minimal sized
 pneumothorax.
