                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 A right tunneled central venous catheter terminates at the right atrium.  A
 left PICC terminates at the mid right atrium.  A nasogastric tube extends to
 at least the level of the stomach and beyond the scope of this study.  The
 heart size is normal.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate
 interstitial edema is similar since ___.  A moderate left pleural
 effusion is slightly improved.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacities reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema. 
 2. Decreased moderate left pleural effusion. 
 3. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 4. Left PICC terminates at the right atrium. To terminate within the SVC, the
 line would need to be withdrawn at least 3.5 cm.  
 
 The initial findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at the time of interpretation, 09:15, ___.
