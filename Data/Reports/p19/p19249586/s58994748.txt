                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Surgery with diarrhea and perinephric fluid collection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at the right base consistent with increasing amounts of pleural fluid with
 associated compressive atelectasis.  Streak of atelectasis is seen at the left
 base and there may be a small effusion on this side as well.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube again extends well into the stomach.  No convincing evidence
 of vascular congestion.
 
 The previously described fracture of the mid shaft of the clavicle on the
 right is again seen.
