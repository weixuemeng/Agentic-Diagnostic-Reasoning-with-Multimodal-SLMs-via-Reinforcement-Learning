                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube terminates at least in the proximal duodenum, but the
 tip of the tube is beyond the field of view.  Endotracheal tube has been
 removed in the interval, with other indwelling devices similar in appearance
 to the previous study.  Apparent increase in moderate partially layering
 pleural effusions with adjacent basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no relevant
 short interval changes since recent study of several hours earlier.
