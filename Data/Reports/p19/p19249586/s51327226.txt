                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post kidney transplant.  Study
 requested for evaluation of interval change in pleural effusions and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, left PICC
 line tip is curving along the tracheobronchial angle and now terminates in the
 azygos vein.  Right pigtail catheter is in unchanged position and Dobhoff tube
 terminates in the stomach. There has been interval decrease of a small right
 apical pneumothorax. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased, with
 a fissural component on the right and likely a loculated component on the
 left. There is bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the right. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left PICC line tip now terminates in the azygos vein, for which
 repositioning is recommended.
 
 2.  Interval decrease of small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 11:44 a.m., at the time of discovery.
