 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little change in
 appearance of the left pleural effusion.  The right pleural effusion, however,
 has minimally decreased in extent, the right lung is now substantially better
 ventilated than before.  On the right, a 8-mm post-procedural pneumothorax
 (after chest tube insertion) is currently seen.  There is no evidence of
 tension.  Unchanged left PICC line, unchanged nasogastric tube.
