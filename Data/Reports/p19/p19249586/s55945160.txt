                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with HCV and HRS requiring hemodialysis,
 with right pleural effusion.  Study requested for evaluation of effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: Left PICC line terminates in mid-to-lower SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 projects over the gastric fundus, the tip is not included in this examination.
 Right pigtail catheter remains in unchanged position.  
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, small residual
 bilateral effusions are identified, more on the left. Small right apical
 pneumothorax persists. There is increased atelectasis of the right lower lung
 and left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. There is evidence of a clavicular fracture on the right.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left.  
 
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Increased right lower lobe atelectasis and left retrocardiac opacity,
 likely due to atelectasis.
