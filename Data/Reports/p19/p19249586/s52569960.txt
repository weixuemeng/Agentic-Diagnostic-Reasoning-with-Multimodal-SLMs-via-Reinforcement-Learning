                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post left pigtail catheter
 removal, evaluate for pneumothorax versus residual pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient condition required examination in sitting upright position
 using AP frontal and left lateral views.  During the interval, a left-sided
 basal pleural catheter advanced through the lower left lateral chest wall has
 been removed.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Both apical areas are screened
 with magnifying device and there is no evidence of any remaining apical
 pneumothorax.  Previously described PICC line in unchanged position.  Lateral
 view discloses persistent bilateral pleural effusion, more on the left than
 the right.  Size of these effusions has not changed during the latest one day
 interval.
