 As compared to the previous radiograph, the radiographic appearance is mildly
 improved. The right lung base has increased in radiolucency, likely reflecting
 a decrease in pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. The retrocardiac
 atelectasis is unchanged, also unchanged is the small left pleural effusion
 but overall, the signs of pulmonary edema have decreased in extent and
 severity. No new focal parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax. Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.
