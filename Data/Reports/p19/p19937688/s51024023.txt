                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis, assess for new focal opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Compared to prior study, the cardiac silhouette has increased in size.  There
 is also increased opacity in bilateral lung bases.  These findings are
 suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.  However, in view of the clinical
 history provided, these findings could also reflect multifocal pneumonia. Old
 deformity of the left clavicle is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lung base opacity, in association with increase in cardiac size,
 likely refecting pulmonary vascular congestion.  However, given clinical
 history, multifocal pneumonia is also a possibility.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:28 AM, 10 minutes after the images were radiology.
