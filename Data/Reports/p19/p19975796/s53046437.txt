 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a cavitating mass in the right upper lobe with associated volume loss
 and destruction of 1 of the overlying ribs.  This is unchanged in appearance
 when compared to the prior study.  An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip
 terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the level the carina.  A nasoenteric
 tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the tip is not visualized.  A
 left internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  Prominence of
 the right hilum is presumed reflect lymphadenopathy versus direct extension of
 the known mass.  Left lung appears grossly clear.  No pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
