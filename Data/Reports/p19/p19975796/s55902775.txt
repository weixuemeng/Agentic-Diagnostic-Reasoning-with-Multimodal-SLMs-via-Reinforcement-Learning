                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and palpitations  // eval for
 pneumonia, CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Similar to scout image from ___, there is large area of opacity
 in the right upper hemi thorax in right perihilar region concerning for
 postobstructive pneumonia secondary to known large juxta hilar mass.  The left
 lung remains hyperinflated.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large area of right upper hemi thorax and right juxta hilar opacity, grossly
 similar in distribution as compared to the prior CT, although with possibly
 slightly more fluid in the right lung apex, overall worrisome for
 postobstructive pneumonia secondary to right juxta hilar mass.  Reported 
 right chest wall metastasis on prior CT better assessed on CT.
