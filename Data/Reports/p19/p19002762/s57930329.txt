                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fall out of bed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is bibasilar atelectasis
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A nodular
 opacity in the right upper lobe is superimposed over the right sixth posterior
 rib.  The heart cannot be well evaluated due to lung volumes.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  Degenerative change is seen in the
 shoulder girdles bilaterally. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
 Compression deformities in the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 
 2.  Nodule in the right upper lobe is superimposed over the right posterior
 rib, new from ___.  Shallow obliques off the frontal view could be performed
 for further evaluation.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at
