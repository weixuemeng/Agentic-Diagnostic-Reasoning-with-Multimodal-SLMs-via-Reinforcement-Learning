                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left-sided chest pain status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears mildly enlarged
 with sharp margins, likely in part due to low lung volumes.  If high concern
 for mediastinal injury, CT would be recommended.  Lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  No displaced
 fracture seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which likely accentuates the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  If concern for mediastinal injury, CT.
 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen, although if clinical concern for rib
 fracture is high, suggest dedicated rib series.
