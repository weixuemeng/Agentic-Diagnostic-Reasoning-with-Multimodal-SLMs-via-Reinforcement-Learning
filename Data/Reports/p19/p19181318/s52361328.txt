                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable supine chest radiograph was provided.  The right lung
 appears well expanded without focal consolidation.  There is a left lower lung
 and retrocardiac opacity.  Given the shift of the cardiac silhouette leftward,
 there is likely component of volume loss.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A
 left pleural effusion may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right
 central line with two tips terminates in the lower right atrium.  The bones
 are intact.  There are no displaced fractures.  Calcifications project over
 the upper abdomen, may be within the pancreas.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity likely due to volume loss given the shift
 of the mediastinum, however component of infection or effusion cannot be
 excluded.
 
 Calcifications projecting over the upper abdomen, potentially pancreatic-
 correlate withpossibile history of chronic pancreatitis.  Prior imaging,
 should it become available would be of use.
