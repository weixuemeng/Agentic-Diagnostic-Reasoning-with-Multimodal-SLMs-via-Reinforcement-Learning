                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Right-sided large-bore central venous
 catheter likely terminates in the right atrium.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left
 base opacity seen which may be due to atelectasis however, underlying
 consolidation or small pleural effusion is difficult to entirely excluded. 
 There is mild left mid lung atelectasis/scarring.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  No overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Left base opacity and obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm may be due to atelectasis and small pleural effusion,
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is evidence of bowel signature
 over the inferior left hemithorax, superior to the level of the right
 hemidiaphragm and the left hemidiaphragm may be elevated or there may be a
 hiatal hernia.
