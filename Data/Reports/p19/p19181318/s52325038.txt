                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM
 
 Request was made to attempt to evaluate the location of the tip of small
 catheter.  On the review, the tip of small catheter appears to be in the
 distal SVC.  This is best seen on the lateral view, but also confirmed on the
 frontal view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  As on prior, there is dense
 consolidation at the left lung base obscuring hemidiaphragm.  This may be due
 to a combination of consolidation, atelectasis and effusion.  Hiatal hernia
 suspected.  The right lung remains clear.  2 separate right subclavian lines
 are identified with the larger catheter seen with tip terminating in the right
 atrium.  The smaller catheter tip is not clearly delineated on the current
 exam.  Degenerative changes in the spine without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dense left basilar opacity similar to previous exam which may be due to a
 combination of effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.
