 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple injuries, status post fall at home, evaluation for
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both the parenchymal abnormalities and the rib fractures are better
 visualized on the CT examination performed on ___.  On the
 current radiograph, there is no safe indication of pneumothorax, although a
 hypertransparency lucency along the aortic arch persists.  The bilateral chest
 tubes, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
 position.  Lung volumes remain low.  Acute change as compared to the previous
 image is obvious on the radiograph.
