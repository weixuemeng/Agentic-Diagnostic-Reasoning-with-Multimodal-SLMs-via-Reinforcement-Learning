                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple injuries, status post fall, evaluation of chest tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  These include an endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube,
 a left subclavian central venous access line, as well as a left and right
 chest tube.  The chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Despite the low lung
 volumes there is no evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions. 
 Small atelectatic lung portions, notably in the retrocardiac lung area, are
 unchanged in appearance.
