                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from 25 minutes prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 at the level of thoracic inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach.  The lungs are low in volume, giving the appearance
 of bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified on this
 supine film.  The heart and mediastinum appear unremarkable.  Non-displaced
 right second rib fracture is seen. Possible right clavicular fracture with
 periosteal reaction is noted distally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Satisfactory position of ET tube, which should not be withdrawn any
 further as it is at thoracic inlet.
 
 2.  Non-displaced right second rib fracture. Possible right distal clavicular
 fracture.
