                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Spontaneous pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum, question change.
 
 CHEST (PA & LAT)
 
 Both right and left pneumothoraces are less apparent on the current
 examination.  There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema still
 overlying both lung apices and overlying the left supraclavicular soft
 tissues. Trace pneumomediastinum remains visible, less than on the prior film.
 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette, otherwise,
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Complete versus near-complete resolution of biapical pneumothoraces.  Minimal
 residual pneumomediastinum.  Lungs otherwise clear.
