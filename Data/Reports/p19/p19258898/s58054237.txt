                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 patchy opacity in the left lung base on the frontal view is not well
 substantiated on the lateral view and could be due to atelectasis or early
 infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Partially imaged is cervical
 hardware in the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left base opacity only seen on the frontal views, could be
 due to atelectasis, although infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
