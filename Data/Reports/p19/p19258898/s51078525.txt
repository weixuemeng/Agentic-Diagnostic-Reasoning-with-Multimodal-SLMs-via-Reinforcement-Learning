                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with seizures, question aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 12:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hardware overlies the cervical spine as noted previously.  Since the prior
 study, lung volumes have markedly diminished and there is patchy hazy opacity
 at the left base which may represent patchy atelectasis, although aspiration
 or pneumonia should also be considered as the patient has undergone a recent
 seizure.  Followup imaging would be advised.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged, given differences in positioning and inspiration.
