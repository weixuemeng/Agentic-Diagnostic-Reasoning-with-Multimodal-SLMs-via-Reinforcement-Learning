                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male pancreatic cancer and 3 days of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low inspiratory effort
 seen on the current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  Linear right basilar opacity is seen most likely due to
 atelectasis.  Superiorly the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear right basilar opacity most likely due to atelectasis given the low lung
 volumes.  Infection is not entirely excluded.  If desired, repeat frontal view
 with improved inspiratory effort can be performed to further clarify.
