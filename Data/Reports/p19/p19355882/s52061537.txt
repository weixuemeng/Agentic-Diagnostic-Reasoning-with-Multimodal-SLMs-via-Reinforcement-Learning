                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Another comparison is a set of radiographs from
 earlier on the same day from an outside hospital.
  
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The course of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but
 it probably terminates, as before, at the cavoatrial junction.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Hazy opacification of
 each lung is consistent with pulmonary edema, probably somewhat worse than on
 the prior study, although increased blurring may be due to differences in
 technique to some extent.  In particular, in the left mid lung, there is a
 more conspicuous opacity, but this may be due to rotation compared to the
 prior study.  Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably similar findings suggesting pulmonary edema since the
 recent prior study.  In addition, a developing left mid lung opacity, which
 may indicate coinciding infection is doubted but hard to excluded.  If
 developing infection is a possible clinical concern, then follow-up
 radiographs are suggested to reassess.
