                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pleural effusion. Patient had a left-sided
 thoracentesis.  No chest tube was placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left pleural effusion is smaller since the study two hours
 prior following recent thoracentesis. There is a small left apical
 pneumothorax.  The heart is partially obscured; however, there is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Opacities in the right infrahilar region may reflect
 atelectasis.  2.4 cm nodular opacity projecting over the ___ anterior
 interspace may relate to the costochondral junction. The aortic knob is
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion is smaller.
 2.  Small left apical pneumothorax is new.
 3.  2.4 cm left apical nodular opacity may relate to the costochondral
 junction and can be re-assessed on follow-up chest radiograph. CT should be
 obtained if the finding persists. 
 
 These results were telephoned to ___, MD by ___, MD at
 5:05 a.m., ___, five minutes after discovery.
