                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent left pleural effusion s/p left
 thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and placement of left sided pleurx without
 pleurodesis on ___ found to have new R pleural effusion and L loculated
 effusion. Now 1 day s/p R chest tube placement.  // pneumothorax, chest tube
 placement, progress of bilateral pleural effusions   pneumothorax, chest tube

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely
 secondary to known loculated pleural effusions as seen on prior chest CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the left, likely reflecting volume
 loss. Calcifications are seen along the aortic knob. Patchy streaky opacities
 at the right lung base are likely reflective of atelectasis, with minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be secondary to a small
 amount of pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Stable near complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
 
 2.  Leftward shift of cardiomediastinal structures, secondary to lung
 collapse.
