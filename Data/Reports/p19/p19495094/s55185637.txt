                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, history of pleural effusion  //
 evidence of effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate size left pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size
 compared to the prior radiograph, with a component appearing to be loculated
 laterally. Opacification within the left lung base may reflect compressive
 atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded. Assessment of the
 cardiac silhouette size is difficult given the presence of the left pleural
 effusion. The aortic knob is calcified. Hazy opacification with in the right
 lung base may be due to overlying soft tissue. There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size left pleural effusion, slightly larger than on the prior study.
 Left basilar opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
