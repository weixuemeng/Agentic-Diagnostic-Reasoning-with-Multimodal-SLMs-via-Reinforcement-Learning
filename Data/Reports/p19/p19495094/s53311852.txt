                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with b/l pleural effusions of unclear etiology
 s/p Left chest tube/PleurX placement  // Please perform by 6:30AM and assess
 for improved aeration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left pleural drainage catheter can be traced just medial to the plane of the
 left lower chest wall, but the tip is not visible.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion is probably unchanged since ___. There is no pneumothorax.
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger, accompanied by early interstitial
 edema.  Heart is moderately enlarged chronically. Leftward shift of the
 mediastinum suggests opacification in the left lower lobe is due to persistent
 atelectasis.  A right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
