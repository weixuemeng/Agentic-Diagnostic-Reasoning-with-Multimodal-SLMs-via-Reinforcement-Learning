 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and placement of left sided pleurx without
 pleurodesis on ___ found to have new R pleural effusion and L loculated
 effusion. Now 1 day s/p R chest tube placement.  // pneumothorax, chest tube

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again essentially
 complete opacification of the left hemithorax, known to represent pleural
 effusions by CT. Obliquity of patient makes it difficult to determine whether
 there has been any mediastinal shift.  The atelectatic changes at the right
 base with blunting of the costophrenic angle are less than on the previous
 study.
