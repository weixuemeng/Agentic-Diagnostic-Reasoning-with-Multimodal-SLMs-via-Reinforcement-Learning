                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions of unknown etiology status post CT-guided
 drainage of loculated left effusion, question pneumothorax, progressive
 effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Rotated, lordotic positioning.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.  Again seen is left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and obscuration of the left costophrenic angle,
 consistent with an effusion.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and its
 position is uncertain.  There is marked pleural thickening at the left lung
 apex as well as some pleural fluid tracking along the left lung.  This appears
 slightly worse, in that the degree of aerated lung is somewhat smaller than on
 the prior film.  Again seen is a left-sided catheter.  The right lung shows
 mild interstitial prominence, suggesting mild fluid overload.  There is
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  No gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Overall similar to the prior film, but the degree of aerated lung on the
 left appears somewhat smaller due to what is likely pleural fluid tracking
 along the left lung apex.  
 2) The interstitial markings on the right are overall similar, but may be
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.  
 3) No obvious pneumothorax is detected, though a subtle pneumothorax might not
 be apparent.
