 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is

 associated left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis. Increased
 patchy opacity within the right lung base is also likely reflective of
 atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
