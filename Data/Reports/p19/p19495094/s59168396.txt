 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p chest tube removal  // evalulate for
 pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal

 CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe is still collapsed, accounting for leftward mediastinal shift,
 and a cause for concern about bronchial obstruction. The volume of residual
 left pleural effusion is difficult to assess, but probably not large. Moderate
 to large right pleural effusion, largely posterior, has increased since
 ___, obscuring detail in the right lower lobe. Heart is probably not
 enlarged. Pulmonary edema is probably not present. Right PIC line can be
 traced at least as far as the low SVC but the tip is indistinct.
