                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of fever, cough.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is overall stable compared to prior exams
 dated back to ___.  Large right pleural effusion is overall
 unchanged compared to the prior study with adjacent consolidation, likely
 secondary to atelectasis at the right lung base.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  There is mild left basilar atelectasis.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change. Large right pleural effusion with adjacent
 consolidation likely secondary to atelectasis, however an acute superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
