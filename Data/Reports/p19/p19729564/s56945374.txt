                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, known pleural effusion  //
 worsening effusion, ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not significantly changed and are
 within normal limits. Again seen is a large right pleural effusion, not
 significantly changed in size from the prior study. There is adjacent
 atelectasis at the right base. New, subtle retrocardiac opacity is likely
 representative of atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large right pleural effusion and adjacent right basal atelectasis is not
 significantly changed from the prior study. Superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
 2. New, subtle left retrocardiac opacity is likely representative of
 atelectasis.
