                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and known history of
 right diaphragmatic hernia.  Evaluation for acute infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior images are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 subsequent right lung volume.  Multiple air-filled loops of bowel are seen
 under the elevated diaphragm, obscuring the right heart border and the heart
 size cannot be determined on this study.  There is no pneumothorax or
 significant pulmonary edema.  The lungs appear grossly clear, however,
 assessment is limited due to large right diaphragmatic hernia.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No evidence of focal pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Marked elevation of right hemidiaphragm secondary to presence of large right
 diaphragmatic hernia.
