 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle could reflect small pleural effusion.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  However, in view of the extensive changes, it would be very
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
