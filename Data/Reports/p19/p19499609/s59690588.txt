                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ett and NG tube, right jugular line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays done the same day at 3:36 and 6:18 a.m.  Chest CT of
 7:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube and NG tube are in adequate position.  Jugular line ends in mid SVC. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Increase in left lower lung opacities due to atelectasis, aspiration or
 pneumonia as shown on concurrent CTA will have to be followed up.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Stable mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Minimal increased left lower lung consolidation could represent
 atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  This will have to be followed up.
 
 Please refer to concurrent chest CTA.
