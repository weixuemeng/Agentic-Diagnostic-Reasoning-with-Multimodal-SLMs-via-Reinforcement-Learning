                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Crampy chest pain after eating.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. Mild blunting of the left posterior costophrenic sulcus makes
 it difficult to exclude a trace effusion, but a pleural effusion is doubtful. 
 There is no pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear. Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
