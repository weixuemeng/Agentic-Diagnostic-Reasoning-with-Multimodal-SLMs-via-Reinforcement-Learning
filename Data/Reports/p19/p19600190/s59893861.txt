                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with several weeks of URI sx, cough with bloody sputum
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated and
 clear aside from a linear density in the left mid lung which could represent a
 focus of scarring or atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is top-normal.  No signs of congestion or edema.
 Imaged bony structures are intact.  Mediastinal contour is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Top normal heart size, hyperinflated lungs likely reflect COPD, left mid lung
 linear density likely scarring or atelectasis.  If symptoms persist, a
 nonemergent chest CT may be performed to further assess.
