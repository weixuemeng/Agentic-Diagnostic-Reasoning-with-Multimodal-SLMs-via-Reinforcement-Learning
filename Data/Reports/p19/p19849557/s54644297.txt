                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset paranoid delusions/psychosis now
 with leukocytosis  // evaluate for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Right chest wall PICC pacer
 device is seen with pacer leads extending into the region of the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  There is bandlike right lower lung opacity most
 compatible with atelectasis.  A rounded density projecting at the right medial
 lung base on the frontal projection is without correlate opacity on the
 lateral view and therefore indeterminate.  There is a retrocardiac opacity
 with subtle central air lucency which could represent a hiatal hernia. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right basal atelectasis, with probable hiatal hernia.
 2. Rounded density projecting at the right medial lung base, indeterminate,
 for which CT of the chest is recommended to further assess.
