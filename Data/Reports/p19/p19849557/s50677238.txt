 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes have improved, but moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened
 and there is still substantial consolidation in the lower lobes due to
 atelectasis and edema or concurrent pneumonia.  Heart is only mildly enlarged.
 Pleural effusions are presumed, small to moderate on the right, small on the
 left.  Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests elevated central venous
 pressure or volume.  There is no pneumothorax.  Transvenous right atrial right
 ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their positions continuous from the
 right pectoral generator.  Hiatus hernia is responsible for collection of gas
 projecting behind the cardiac silhouette.
