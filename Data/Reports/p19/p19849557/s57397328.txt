 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, tachycardia, abdominal
 pain and tenderness. history of metastatic colon AA  // eval for obstruction,
 acute surgical process, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ CTA torso ___ ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is likely due
 to low lung volumes.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, however infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Large hiatal hernia is re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Large hiatal hernia.
