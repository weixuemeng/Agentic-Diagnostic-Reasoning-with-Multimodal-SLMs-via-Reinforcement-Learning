                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and congestion.  Rule out an infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or focal airspace consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size, and unchanged accounting for technique.  The lung volumes are low
 which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Despite this,
 there is mild pulmonary edema with bronchial cuffing, indistinctness of the
 hilar borders and vascular redistribution.  There is mild prominence of the
 right hilus, thought to reflect a dilated main pulmonary artery.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema
