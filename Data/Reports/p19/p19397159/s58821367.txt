                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, altered mental status, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest provided.  The endotracheal tube is
 seen with its tip residing approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Lung volumes
 are low, and there are scattered perihilar opacities likely reflecting
 bronchovascular crowding and/or scattered subsegmental atelectasis.  The
 possibility of trace aspiration is also raised.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Clips reside in the right breast.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube tip positioned 2 cm above the carina.  Mild perihilar
 opacity, likely atelectasis or bronchovascular crowding, cannot exclude trace
 aspiration.
