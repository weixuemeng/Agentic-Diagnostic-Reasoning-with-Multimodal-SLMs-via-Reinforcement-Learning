                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever and oxygen requirement in a patient with
 history of congestive heart failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is stable.  Currently, there is minimal
 interstitial engorgement that might be concerning for mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  There is on the lateral demonstration of small bilateral
 effusions, symmetric and adjacent opacity not very well seen on the PA view. 
 Those findings are most likely representing interstitial edema but basal
 consolidation in particular in the right lower lung cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Followup of the patient after diuresis and antibiotic treatment in
 four weeks is recommended for documentation of resolution.
