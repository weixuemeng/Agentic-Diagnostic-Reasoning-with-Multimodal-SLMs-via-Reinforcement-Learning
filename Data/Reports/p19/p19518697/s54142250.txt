                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with weakness and ataxia.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Increased opacities in the left lower lobe could
 reflect aspiration or early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. 
 The right lung is clear.  The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged with probably a tortuous descending thoracic aorta.  No
 pneumothorax, edema, or pleural effusion.  Multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine are mild.  Right old clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacities may reflect aspiration and/or early pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation.
