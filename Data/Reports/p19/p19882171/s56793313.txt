                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pediatric sternal wires are present. A prosthetic cardiac valve is unchanged
 in configuration.  The heart size is top-normal.  The aortic arch is
 moderately calcified.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The
 central pulmonary vessels are prominent, without edema or congestion.
 
 There persistent left retrocardiac opacity is again seen, slightly more
 exaggerated on the current examination due to lower lung volumes, likely
 reflecting atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal change since the ___ chest radiograph. Persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity is difficult to differentiate between atelectasis and
 small consolidation.
