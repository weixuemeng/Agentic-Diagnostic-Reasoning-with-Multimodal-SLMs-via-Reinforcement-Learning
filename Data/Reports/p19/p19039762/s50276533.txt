                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic intermittent dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a consolidation in the anterior segment
 of the right upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia in the right upper lobe. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended in six to eight weeks in order to ensure
 resolution.
