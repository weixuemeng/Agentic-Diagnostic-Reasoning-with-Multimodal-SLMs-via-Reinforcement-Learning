                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with a history of CAD s/p recent prolonged hospital course
 for DIC of unclear etiology c/b multisystem organ failure, mixed cardiogenic
 and septic shock, and HCAP who is now presenting from rehab with hypoxemic
 respiratory failure, likely ___ worsening heart failure  // eval for pulmonary
 edema, pna   eval for pulmonary edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:05
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Supine positioning exaggerates volume of pleural effusions, probably still
 substantial.  Heart size has decreased considerably over the past several
 days.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild low more severe pulmonary edema
 is probably unchanged given supine positioning.  Bibasilar atelectasis,
 particularly on the left has improved.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Feeding tube ends in the mid stomach.  Right
 PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with the clinical care team at Conference.
