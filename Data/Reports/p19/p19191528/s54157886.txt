                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pancreatic cancer, COPD with weakness, mild
 confusion, diffuse wheeze  // rule out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aortic knob is calcified. 
 Enlargement of the hila bilaterally is compatible with pulmonary arterial
 hypertension as well as underlying lymphadenopathy. The mediastinal contours
 are unchanged. Scattered ill-defined nodular opacities are relatively similar
 compared to the prior exam, compatible with known metastatic lesions. There is
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pleural effusion, new focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Scattered ill-defined nodular opacities compatible with known metastatic
 disease, relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.  Enlargement of the
 hila bilaterally, likely reflective of pulmonary arterial hypertension and
 underlying lymphadenopathy.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
