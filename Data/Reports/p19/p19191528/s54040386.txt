                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  Vascular disease and recent the diagnosed pancreatic
 adenocarcinoma now presenting with weakness and confusion. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly diminished.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  Hilar prominence is compatible with known central
 lymphadenopathy.
 
 The known, numerous nodular metastases are better evaluated on the recent
 chest CT. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. 
 Rib deformities from prior fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Known metastatic disease is better evaluated on the CT chest from 10 days
 prior.
