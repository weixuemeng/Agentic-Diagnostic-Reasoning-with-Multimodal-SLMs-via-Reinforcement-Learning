                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively moderate vascular
 congestion.  This raises the possibility of pericardial effusion or
 cardiomyopathy.
 
 Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
