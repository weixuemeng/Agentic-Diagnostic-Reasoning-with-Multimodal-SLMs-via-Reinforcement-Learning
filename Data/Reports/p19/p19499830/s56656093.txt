                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Assess for infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 There is redemonstration of intact sternotomy wires as well as surgical clips
 scattered throughout the lower thorax, unchanged.  The previously seen
 vascular stent projecting over the mid abdomen is only partially imaged on
 today's study.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is increased compared to the
 prior study.  There is a dense retrocardiac opacification, increased, possibly
 secondary to atelectasis, although infection and/or aspiration could have an
 identical appearance.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly
 changed.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion without frank
 interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased bibasilar retrocardiac dense opacification, possibly secondary
 to atelectasis, although an infectious process could appear similar.  Clinical
 correlation recommended.
 
 2.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
