 pneumonia or CHF.

 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, but there is neither pulmonary edema nor
 particular pulmonary vascular engorgement, both of which have been present at
 one time or another during the past year.  Pleural effusions are tiny and
 could be chronic.  Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass
 grafting.  Calcification of the left atrium suggests long-standing atrial
 hypertension, usually seen with rheumatic heart disease.  Moderate-to-severe
 hyperinflation reflects emphysema.
