                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post central line placement.  Evaluate line placement and
 assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 12:32 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  There has
 been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter,
 ending in the mid-to-low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  A moderate left
 pleural effusion persists.  A small right pleural effusion remains possible. 
 Ill-defined opacities at the right lung base are not significantly changed and
 could be atelectasis or pneumonia.  Left basilar compressive atelectasis is
 again seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter with its
 tip in the mid-to-low SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no
 interval change.
