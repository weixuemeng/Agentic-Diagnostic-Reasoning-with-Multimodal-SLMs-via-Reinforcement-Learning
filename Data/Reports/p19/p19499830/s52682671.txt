                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath and tachypnea, please evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is redemonstration of the enlarged cardiac silhouette,
 possibly related to cardiomegaly, though as previously mentioned pericardial
 effusion IS not excluded.  There is increased prominence of the interstitial
 markings, particularly in the perihilar distribution, likely due to increased
 pulmonary edema.  A moderately sized left pleural effusion is identical in
 appearance to chest radiogrpah performed 3 days earlier, though less apparent
 on intervening radiogrpah, likely due to positioning. Retrocardiac opacity
 likely represents a combination of effusion and atelectasis, though infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  There has been interval removal of the
 endotracheal tube.  The central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior
 vena cava.  No pneumothorax evident.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and
 intact.  No osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion,
 unchanged compared to ___.  Interval removal of endotracheal
 tube.
