                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right IJ central line tip over lower SVC.  Sternotomy wires noted.  
 
 Moderately severe cardiomegaly.  Upper zone re-distribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  Increased retrocardiac density, with
 obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles, consistent with
 small effusions.  On the right, a small amount of underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Cardiomegaly with CHF and interstitial edema.  Small left- greater-than-right
 effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Compared with same
 day ___ at 16:07 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.
