                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question aortic widening or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No definite signs
 of pneumonia.  No overt signs of CHF.  There is mild prominence of the aortic
 knob, but this is likely due to tortuosity with faint atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with unfolded thoracic aorta likely accounting for
 prominence of the mediastinum.  Please refer to subsequent CTA for further
 details.
