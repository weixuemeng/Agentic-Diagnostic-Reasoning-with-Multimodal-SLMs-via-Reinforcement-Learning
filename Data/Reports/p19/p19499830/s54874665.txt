                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left pleural effusion, here to
 evaluate for recurrence of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ with
 multiple prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a moderate left
 pleural effusion obscuring the left hemidiaphragm which is probably unchanged
 from the supine radiograph of ___ with the meniscus better visualized on
 today's upright exam.  A small to moderate right pleural effusion is also
 probably unchanged from the prior radiograph.  Associated bibasilar
 compressive atelectasis is stable.  No pneumothorax is present.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed since the prior
 radiograph.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with wires intact. 
 Cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits with calcified aortic knob and deviation of the trachea to the
 right.  A stent is unchanged in position in the midline corresponding to the
 upper abdominal aorta.  Generalized loss of height and kyphosis is noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate left pleural effusion and small to moderate right
 pleural effusion compared to supine radiograph from ___.
