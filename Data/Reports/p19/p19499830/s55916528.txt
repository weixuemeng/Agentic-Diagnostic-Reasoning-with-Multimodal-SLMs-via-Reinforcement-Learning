                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CABG, left hemothorax, fast track cardiac surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:32 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been
 re-positioning of the left chest tube.  The left apicolateral fluid collection
 has substantially decreased in extent.  However, a small medial pneumothorax
 has newly occurred.
 
 The pre-existing basal right pneumothorax seems to have decreased in extent,
 possibly because of the insertion of a new right ventral chest tube.
 
 Moderate post-operative cardiomegaly.  All other monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.
