                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dating back through ___,
 including the most recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate left pleural effusion is markedly increased compared to
 ___.  There is associated compressive atelectasis at the left
 lung base, underlying consolidation can not be excluded.  Ill-defined
 opacities in the right lower lung are slightly increased compared to the
 ___ radiograph, consistent with either atelectasis or possibly
 an infectious process.  There may be a tiny right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the left pleural
 effusion, although moderate-to-severe enlargement does not seem significantly
 changed.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  Aortic calcifications are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation can not be excluded.  Possibly small right pleural
 effusion.
 
 2.  Right lower lobe atelectasis versus infection.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 1:08
 p.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
