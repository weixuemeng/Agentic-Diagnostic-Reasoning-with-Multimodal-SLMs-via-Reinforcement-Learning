                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Rales at the right
 base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lower lungs are well expanded and clear.  Additional contours at the apex of
 the right lung are most likely pleural scarring, but if there is concern for a
 new lesion at the right lung apex, CT scanning would be helpful.  There is no
 pleural abnormality elsewhere.  Evidence of central lymph node enlargement and
 the heart is normal size.
