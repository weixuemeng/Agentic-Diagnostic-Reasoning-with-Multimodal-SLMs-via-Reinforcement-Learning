 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, previous lingular pneumonia, assessment for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No evidence of pneumonia, notably pre-existing opacity in the lingula
 is no longer visible.  The lung volumes are rather high.  Trace bilateral
 apical scarring, suggesting a moderate degree of overinflation.  No pleural
 effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.  Moderate
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
