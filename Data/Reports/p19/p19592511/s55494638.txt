                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is dense retrocardiac opacification with obscuration
 of the medial margin of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower
 lobe consolidation.  Streaky opacities at the right base probably reflect
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable.  Prominence of
 the right paratracheal soft tissues is unchanged. There is no large effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense retrocardiac opacification, consistent with left lower lobe
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
