 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without
 pulmonary edema. Minimal bibasilar patchy opacities are similar compared to
 the prior study, likely reflective of atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation.
