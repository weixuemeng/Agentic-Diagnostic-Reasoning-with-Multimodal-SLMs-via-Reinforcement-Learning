 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // r/o ptx

 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes limits
 evaluation. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for subtle increase in
 hilar opacity. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
