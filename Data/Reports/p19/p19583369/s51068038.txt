                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis, now complains of right
 upper quadrant and back pain, worse with inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Lungs are reasonably well expanded aside from new regions of peribronchial
 infiltration or atelectasis at the right lung base.  There is no consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia, and although pulmonary vasculature is borderline
 engorged, no edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart is top normal size.
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  Rounded contour to the upper pole of the
 right hilus could be new lymph node enlargement, but there is no atelectasis
 to suggest bronchial obstruction.
