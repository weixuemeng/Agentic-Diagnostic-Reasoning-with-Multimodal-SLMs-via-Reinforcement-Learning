  1. Opacities overlying the left lower lobe and right mid lung fields which may
  be compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
  
  2. Central perihilar vascular prominence which likely represents moderate
  pulmonary vascular congestion.
  
  3. Small left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with methadone OD  // please eval for acute
 abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse airspace opacities throughout the left lung as well as a
 more focal airspace opacity in the right mid lung.  There is a small to
 moderate left pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Apparent
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm could reflect a subpulmonic component of the
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  .  Heart size is top normal and note is
 made of distension of the azygos vein. There is no acute osseus abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities predominantly affecting the
 left lung, concerning for massive aspiration in the setting of recent
 overdose.  Asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema is considered less
 likely.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and small to moderate left pleural effusion.
