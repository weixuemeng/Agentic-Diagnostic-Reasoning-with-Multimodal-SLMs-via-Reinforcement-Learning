                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recently drinking liquids.  High risk of aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 4.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Primarily involving the medial posterior basilar end superior segments of the
 left lower lobe is a more extensive consolidation than seen on the prior
 radiographs with air bronchograms. Areas of new perihilar opacity obscure a
 mass at the left hilum.  Previously noted suspicious lymphadenopathy is not
 well assessed on radiographs. A nodular focus projecting over the right lower
 lung suggests a nipple shadow and there is persistent partial right middle
 lobe atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  A Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the uppermost part of the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing perihilar opacities in the left lung.  Although aspiration is a
 consideration, in the setting on a known left hilar mass suspicious for
 malignancy, post-obstructive pneumonitis could also be considered.
