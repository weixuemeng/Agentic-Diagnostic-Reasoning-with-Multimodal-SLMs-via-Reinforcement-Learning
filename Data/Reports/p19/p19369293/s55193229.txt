 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ htn, presumed CAD in past, mod-severe MR, mild-mod AI, CVA
 w/ residual L sided weakness, p/w chest pressure in setting of hypertension.
 Hypertensive emergency  // any evidence of fluid overload    any evidence of
 fluid overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 S in with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes on this single
 portable view.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in
 size.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification has increased, most
 likely consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
