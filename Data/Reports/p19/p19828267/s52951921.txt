                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:07 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with episode of hypoxia and rising white count. 
 Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 I would be tempted to call the increased peribronchovascular opacification in
 the right mid lung recent aspiration, however on ___, when the patient
 was resolving pulmonary edema, the right lung had the same appearance.
 Therefore, I prefer vascular dilatation and early edema.  Nevertheless, I
 would continue close radiographic surveillance if pneumonia is suspected. 
 Linear calcifications in the right lung and nodular opacities in the left lung
 could all be due to prior asbestos exposure.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, less pronounced today than it was on ___.  There is probably a good-sized hiatus hernia.  Because of the complexity
 of multiple intrathoracic findings, if the clinical situation is equally
 unclear, I would strongly recommend CT scanning for assessment.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  No
 pneumothorax.
