                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer with non-flushing Port-A-Cath.  Check position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a right
 chest wall port with the catheter terminating at the approximate cavoatrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is a asymmetric opacity in the left
 middle lung field which may be due to post-radiation changes. However, if
 symptoms are present, concurrent pneumonia is possible.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac contour is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of right chest wall Port-A-Cath with the
 tip terminating at the approximate cavoatrial junction. Opacity in the left
 middle lung field which likely represents post radiation changes, however
 concurrent pneumonia is possible if symptoms exist.
