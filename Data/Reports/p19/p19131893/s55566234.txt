                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of PCP pneumonia, now with productive cough and fevers. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a right
 chest port with the tip in the low SVC and a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Well aerated lungs are clear.  Previously seen density in the
 left lower lung is decreased and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Clear lungs without evidence of pneumonia.  Please note that chest radiograph
 is not sensitive for PCP pneumonia, and if clinically concerned, a repeat CT
 chest would be helpful for further evaluation.
