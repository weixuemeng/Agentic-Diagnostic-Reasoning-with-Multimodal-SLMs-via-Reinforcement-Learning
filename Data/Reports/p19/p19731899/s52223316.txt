                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision, unrestrained driver with air bled
 deployment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly
 unfolded and demonstrates diffuse calcifications.  The pulmonary vascularity
 is not engorged although there is bronchovascular crowding.  Minimal
 atelectatic changes are noted at the lung bases.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures
 are seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with anterior
 osteophyte formation is seen as well as osteophytic spurring in the right
 acromioclavicular joint.  Several rounded soft tissue calcifications are noted
 in the right breast.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No displaced rib fractures
 noted, though assessment is limited.  If there is continued clinical concern,
 a dedicated rib series is recommended.
