                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of lung cancer with fevers and tachycardia  //
 Assess for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral pulmonary nodules and potentially masses, most numerous at
 the lung bases. The largest conglomerate abnormality projects over the
 superior segment of the right lower lobe. Blunting the left costophrenic angle
 could be due to atelectasis or small effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No definite focal osseous abnormality
 identified. Deformity of the mid left clavicle suggests prior healed fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral nodules/masses in the lungs, most numerous at the lung bases
 worrisome for metastatic disease. Please note that superimposed infection,
 particularly in the right lower lobe would be difficult to exclude given
 disease burden and lack of priors.
