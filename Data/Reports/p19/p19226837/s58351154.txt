                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with presyncope and bradycardia, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear
 hyperexpanded lungs.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal. There is an LV
 configuration to the left heart border, which combined with a tortuous aorta
 suggests hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperexpanded lungs, without evidence of pneumonia.
