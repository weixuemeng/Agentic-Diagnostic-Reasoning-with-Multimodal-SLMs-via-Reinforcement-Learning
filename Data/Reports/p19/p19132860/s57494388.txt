                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent bradycardia to the 30s.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  There
 is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
