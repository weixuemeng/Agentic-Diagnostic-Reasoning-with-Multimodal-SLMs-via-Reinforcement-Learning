                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, prospective renal transplant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 are normal and there is no pleural effusion.  Lateral view shows thickening of
 the soft tissue anterior and posterior to the lower sternum.  At least the
 external component should be accessible to physical examination to be sure
 that this is nothing more than fat deposition.  If that is inconclusive, CT
 scanning would be useful.
