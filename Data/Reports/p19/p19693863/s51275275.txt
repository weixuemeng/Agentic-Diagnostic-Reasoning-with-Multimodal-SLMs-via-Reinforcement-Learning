                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities show interval improvement,
 particularly in the left lung.  Within the right lung, there are residual
 diffuse pulmonary opacities which likely reflect pneumonia, although
 differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. 
 Pulmonary nodule is present in the periphery of the left upper lobe measuring
 1.8 cm in diameter, and is more fully characterized on subsequently dictated
 CT under clip ___.  Bibasilar reticular opacities likely reflect
 underlying chronic lung disease, and are also more fully evaluated on the CT
 exam.
