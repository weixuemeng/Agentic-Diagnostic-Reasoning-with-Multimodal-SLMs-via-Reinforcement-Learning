                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ as well as a CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer status post right lower lobectomy, assess lungs
 and chest tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Right CP angle
 is excluded.  A right chest tube is again noted with its tip extending along
 the right mediastinal border extending superiorly.  There is mild left basilar
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right paratracheal stripe appears
 thickened up to 2.5 cm, new from prior exam, of unclear etiology. 
 Subcutaneous gas is noted in the right supraclavicular region, possibly
 related to the right chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right chest tube in place, positioned as described.  Subcutaneous
 gas in the right supraclavicular region likely related to chest tube. 
 Prominence of the mediastinum can be exaggerated due to portable technique,
 though right paratracheal thickening is of unclear etiology.  Please correlate
 clinically.  Left basilar atelectasis noted.
