                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of non-small-cell lung cancer status
 post right lower lobectomy, having chest pain and shortness of breath //
 Please evaluate for infectious process, effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, PET-CT ___, chest radiograph
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated with hyperinflation of the lungs. 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is similar with
 previously demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy better seen on CT.  Hilar
 contours are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small
 right pleural effusion appears unchanged compared to the most recent chest
 radiograph, and there is no pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the right lung
 base likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Interstitial opacities in the left
 lung base appear chronic.  Spiculated nodular opacity in the periphery of the
 left upper lobe appears relatively unchanged.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion, not substantially changed from the previous
 chest radiograph.  Streaky right basilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  Unchanged spiculated nodular
 opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe.
