                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left VATS with chest tube removed, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right catheter has been
 removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Some prominence of the
 right paramediastinal area is again seen, consistent most likely with
 tortuosity to the brachiocephalic vessels and the portable technique. 
 Subcutaneous gas is again seen in the right supraclavicular region.  No
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
