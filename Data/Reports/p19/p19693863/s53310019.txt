                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post lobectomy for lung cancer with altered mental status.
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There
 are stable post-surgical changes in the right lung with linear scarring.  The
 right pleural effusion appears to have resolved.  Linear opacification at the
 left base is stable, and likely a combination of atelectasis and some pleural
 calcifications.  There is no new opacity.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits, and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right-sided post-surgical changes and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
