                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal with mildly tortuous thoracic aortic arch.
 Hilar contours are unchanged.  Again identified is a widespread ground-glass
 opacity involving most of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and left
 lung base, similar compared to a CT examination from one day prior given
 difference in technique. Again appreciated is small right-sided pleural
 effusion.  Again identified is a roughly 1.6 cm left upper lobe nodule as seen
 on recent CT examination.  The remainder of the left lung field is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Similar appearance of widespread ground-glass opacities involving the
 right upper and middle lobe and left lung base which may represent infection
 or hemorrhage. Drug toxicity is possible although unilateral focal involvement
 makes this unlikely.
 2.  Roughly 1.6 cm left upper lobe lung nodule as on CT.
 3.  Small right pleural effusion.
