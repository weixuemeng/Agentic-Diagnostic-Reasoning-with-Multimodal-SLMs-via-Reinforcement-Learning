                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Slight subpleural scarring is noted at each lung apex.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is patchy opacity projecting
 over the left mid to lower lobe suggesting pneumonia, not well seen on the
 lateral view but suspected to reside primarily in the left lower lobe but
 perhaps involving the lingula.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pneumonia in the left lower lung.
