                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single upright AP image of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is
 opacity at the left lung base which is supsicious for pneumonia.  There is
 pleural thickening at the left lung base, which could represent loculated
 pleural effusion.  There is also diffuse left-sided pleural thickening with
 overall volume loss, which maybe related to previous infection or hemothorax. 
 There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Destruction and sclerosis of both glenohumeral
 joints is noted, suggestive of possible rheumatoid arthritis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity at the left lung base, supsicious for bacterial or atypical
 pneumonia, including tuberculosis.
 
 2.  Pleural thickening at the left lung base, which could represent loculated
 pleural effusion. 
 
 3.  Destruction and sclerosis of both glenohumeral joints is noted, suggestive
 of possible rheumatoid arthritis.
