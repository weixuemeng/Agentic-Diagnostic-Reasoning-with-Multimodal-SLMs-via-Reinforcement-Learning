                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent exudate and effusion, status post VATS decortication,
 presenting with new left lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  A chest tube again projects over the
 left lower chest wall, although its sidehold again lies outside the left
 hemithorax.  There is persistent volume loss with mild leftward mediastinal
 shift and a moderate suspected pleural effusion in the left lower hemithorax. 
 A focus of band-like atelectasis in the left mid lung has partly resolved. 
 The lateral view suggests persistent consolidation with air bronchograms in
 the left lower lobe, again without clear change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar persistent loculated left-sided pleural effusion and
 consolidation.  Chest tube terminating in the left lower hemithorax, although
 the sidehole again lies outside the pleural cavity.
