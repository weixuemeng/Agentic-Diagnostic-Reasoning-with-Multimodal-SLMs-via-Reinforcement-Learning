                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with tip projecting
 towards the left apex.  Subcutaneous emphysema within the left chest wall is
 new.  There has been slight interval improvement in aeration of the left upper
 lung field with persistently large left pleural effusion.  Left basilar
 opacification is compatible with atelectasis.  The right lung is grossly clear
 though the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
 Deformity within the ribs bilaterally is compatible old fractures.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the left upper lung field status post
 placement of a left sided chest tube.  Large left pleural effusion, slightly
 improved in the interval.
