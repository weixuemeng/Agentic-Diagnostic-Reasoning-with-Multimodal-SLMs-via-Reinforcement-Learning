                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with empyema requiring assessment for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs.
 There is a persistent left-sided pleural effusion/empyema, which appears
 unchanged in size from most recent imaging, accounting for slightly different
 patient positioning.  Some left basilar plate atelectasis is seen.  Slight
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is also again seen.  The right lung is
 clear with no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged chest radiograph.
