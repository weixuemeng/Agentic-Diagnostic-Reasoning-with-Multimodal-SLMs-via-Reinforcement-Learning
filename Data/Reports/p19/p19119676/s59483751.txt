                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New pleural effusion, chest tube placement, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:12 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided chest tube
 is in unchanged position.  There is no evidence of left pneumothorax. 
 However, the left pleural effusion has slightly increased and not, as
 expected, decreased.  The presence of air-fluid levels suggests potential
 loculation.
 
 Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged low lung
 volumes  overall, but normally appearing right lung.
