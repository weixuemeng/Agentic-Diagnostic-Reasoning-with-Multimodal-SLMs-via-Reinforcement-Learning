                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Large left exudative pleural effusion status post left VATS
 decortication.  Assess position of ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is a left basal chest tube.  The side hole is in the subcutaneous
 tissues of the left chest outside pleural cavity.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is obscured by parenchymal abnormalities.  Large
 opacity in the left lower lobe consistent with atelectasis has worsened from
 prior study.  Small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged.  Left PICC
 tip is in the mid to lower SVC.  The right lung is grossly clear.  Widened
 mediastinum is unchanged.  There is air in the subcutaneous tissue adjacent to
 the chest tube.  This is suspected due to open wound.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at the time of
 the discovery of the findings at 9:30 a.m.
