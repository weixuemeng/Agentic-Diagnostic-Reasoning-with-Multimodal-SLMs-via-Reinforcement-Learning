                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MG  // Please assess for pna prior to
 extubation
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip and side-port overlying stomach.  A third tube, likely an
 enteric tube with the radiopaque tip, overlies the lower mediastinum and has
 not pass beyond the GE junction.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  This likely accounts for the appearance of mild
 vascular plethora and for atelectasis at the left lung base.  No focal
 consolidation or effusion is identified.  No supine film evidence of
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal patchy opacity at the left lung base, most likely atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  If there is specific concern for focal
 infection infiltrate, then a lateral view may help for further assessment.
 2. Lungs otherwise grossly clear.
 3. Tube with radiopaque tip overlying the lower mediastinum and not extending
 beyond the GE junction,?  enteric tube .   Clinical correlation requested.
