                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p pericardial window  // interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:26.  Targeted review of
 chest CTA from ___ at 02:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the most recent prior chest x-ray, no significant change is
 detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac
 density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  This area of
 retrocardiac opacity apparently includes the patient's known necrotic lung
 mass, which was better depicted on the ___ CT scan.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is platelike atelectasis
 at the right lung base medially.  Tubing seen overlying the left hemidiaphragm
 likely corresponds to the the patient's pericardial drain.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with ___ at 19:26.
