 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:35 PM
  Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Low lung volumes.  Linear
  opacities at the right lung base are unchanged, likely reflecting linear
  atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity is also unchanged, likely reflecting
  basilar atelectasis.  Lucency peritoneal left upper abdomen likely represents
  gastric air bubble.  There is no pneumothorax.  Difficult to exclude a trace
  left pleural effusion.  No new focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal cell carcinoma, pericardial effusion
 s/p cardiac window ___, now with worsening chest pain  // eval for
 interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:29 and allowing for differences in
 positioning and technique, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is prominent retrocardiac opacity,  with a single surgical clip
 overlying the cardiac silhouette.  As before, the possibility of a left-sided
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Also again seen is upper zone redistribution an
 atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region, in the setting of low
 inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, the right lung is otherwise grossly
 clear.  No pneumothorax is detected in the setting of lordotic positioning.
 
 Prominent lucency is seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, but could
 represent gas within the stomach.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Doubt significant interval change compared with earlier the same day.
 2. Increased retrocardiac opacity again noted, similar to the prior study.
 3. No new focal opacity identified .  Doubt significant CHF.
