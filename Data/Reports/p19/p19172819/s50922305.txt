                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC, found to have large pericardial
 effusion, s/p drain  // effusion, lung changes      effusion, lung changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___,
 read in conjunction with subsequent chest CT on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very large cardiac silhouette, substantially increased since ___, is due
 in part to large pericardial effusion seen on the chest ___  ___ drainage
 catheter projects over the cardiac apex.  The second device with a metallic
 tip marker of projects over the left lower lobe bronchus.  I do not know if
 left lower lobe is largely ectatic and that is part of the pericardiocentesis
 apparatus or external.  Clinical correlation is needed.
 
 Left lower lobe is largely atelectatic, and there is some pleural effusion. 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax on either side.
