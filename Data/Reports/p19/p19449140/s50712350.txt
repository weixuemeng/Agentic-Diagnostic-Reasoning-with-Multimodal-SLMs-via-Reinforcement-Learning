                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a slight prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery contour of uncertain significance, perhaps artifactual. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal prominence of the main pulmonary artery contour, but
 probably within normal limits; otherwise unremarkable.
