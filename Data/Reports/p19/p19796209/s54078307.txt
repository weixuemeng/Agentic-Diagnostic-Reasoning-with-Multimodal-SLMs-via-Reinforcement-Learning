                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Bilateral ribs fractures, hemothorax, chest tube on suction,
 in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal.  A small
 right basal pneumothorax is less conspicuous than before.  There is a right
 basal chest tube.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Linear opacities
 in the right upper lobe, most likely atelectasis, increased from prior.
