                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest are compared to previous exam from
 ___.
 
 As on prior, there is increased retrocardiac opacity which partially
 silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear of confluent
 consolidation.  Calcified granulomas are identified over the left upper lung. 
 Costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are
 the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity which could be due to either atelectasis
 versus consolidation.  Two-view chest may help further characterize.
