 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with diffuse abdominal pain and bloody stool.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence for free intraperitoneal air under the
 diaphragms on this view.  Obscuration of the left costophrenic angle with left
 lower lung opacity may be secondary to atelectasis, but is incompletely
 evaluated on this view.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Heart size is top
 normal.  The aorta is tortuous with calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung opacity, which is incompletely evaluated on this
 view and on subsequent CT abdomen.  Lateral radiograph is recommended for
 initial further evaluation. 
 
 This finding and recommendation were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 by phone at 8:18 a.m. on ___ after attending radiologist review of this
 study and recommendation of lateral radiograph.
