                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Given this,
 there is opacity at the left costophrenic angle with lateral left base opacity
 which may be due to pleural effusion with atelectasis and/or pleural
 thickening.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There may also be a trace right pleural
 effusion/pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image.  Opacity at the
 peripheral bilateral lung bases, left greater than right, may be due to
 pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.
