                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  There is unfolding and
 calcification of the thoracic aorta.  A soft tissue density projecting over
 the medial right lung apex is uncertain in etiology but may be due to mild
 vascular congestion or atelectasis, but perhaps less likely pneumonia, in the
 right upper lobe.  To some extent this may be more due to mediastinal widening
 on the right.  Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe is likely compatible with
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature does not appear particularly prominent. 
 Bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable medial right upper lobe opacity versus mediastinal
 widening.  When clinically feasible, repeat radiographs are suggested with PA
 and lateral technique to better assess.   The main concern is a possible right
 perihilar consolidation which might indicate pneumonia in the appropriate
 setting.  There is no generalized convincing evidence for fluid overload
 although the finding may alternatively indicate mild perihilar congestion
 change.
