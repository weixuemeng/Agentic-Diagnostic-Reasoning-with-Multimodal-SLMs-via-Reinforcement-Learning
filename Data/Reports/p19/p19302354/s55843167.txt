                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left lower lobe crackles and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___. 
 
 There is a semi-circular opacity projecting next to the right mediastinal
 border.  It is unclear if it represents a neoesophagus, for example in a
 patient with prior esophageal surgery, or interval distention of an aortic
 aneurysm  or lymphadenopathy, although unlikely given the substantial increase
 in size as compared to the prior study.  Lungs are essentially clear except
 for bibasal minimal atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 In the absence of prior history available, the recommendation would be to
 proceed with chest CT for precise characterization of the above described
 abnormality.
