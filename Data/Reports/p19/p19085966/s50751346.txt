                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post cardiac surgery, evaluate central line.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:44 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the right IJ central line is seen, but does not
 extend into the chest and overlies the lower neck, question retraction or
 exchange of line.  An additional line overlies the mediastinum, but can only
 be traced in the lower mediastinum, presumably an NG tube, but not confirmed
 to extend into the stomach. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  As before, there is increased opacity at
 the left lung base, including obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and mild
 patchy cardiophrenic opacity.  Mild vascular plethora is again noted, with
 possible slight interval improvement. 
 
 Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Continued bibasilar opacity, with possible slight improvement in CHF
 findings.
 
 2.  Right IJ central line has either been retracted or, if replaced, does not
 extend into the chest.  Findings discussed with the covering house officer,
 Dr. ___, at the time of discovery at 1:25 p.m. on the day of the exam
 (___, phone).
