                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior images are available for comparison at this time.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest demonstrates relatively low lung volumes.  The
 cardiac silhouette is slightly prominent, but this is likely due to AP
 portable technique.  No focal opacity is identified within the lungs and there
 is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
