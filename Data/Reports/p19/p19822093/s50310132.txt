                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DKA, known osteomyelitis, likely aspiration,
 with fever  // any evidence of intrapulmonary infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, inspiratory volumes are lower.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is more pronounced, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  There is patchy opacity in both at both bases, more pronounced
 medially.  There is minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles, consistent
 with small effusions.  Mild vascular plethora is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy opacity at both lung bases most likely represents atelectasis in
 the setting of lower lung volumes.  However, the differential diagnosis could
 include areas of aspiration or early infectious infiltrate.  Small bilateral
 effusions are likely now present.
