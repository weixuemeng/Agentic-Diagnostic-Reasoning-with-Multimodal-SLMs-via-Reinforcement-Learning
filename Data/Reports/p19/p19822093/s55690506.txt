                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chills and shaking.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present.  The heart size is
 normal.  Apparent fullness of the right hilum on one of the frontal radiograph
 is likely secondary to rotation.  A dense nodule in the left lateral
 mid-thorax is felt to likely represent a calcified granuloma.  There is a
 linear radiodense foreign body projecting beneath the right hemidiaphragm on
 the frontal radiograph and posteriorly on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Radiodense foreign body with the appearance of a sewing needle is most
 likely outside of the patient.  However, if this cannot be confirmed, a repeat
 radiograph is recommended to ensure it is no longer present.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 10:15 pm ___.
