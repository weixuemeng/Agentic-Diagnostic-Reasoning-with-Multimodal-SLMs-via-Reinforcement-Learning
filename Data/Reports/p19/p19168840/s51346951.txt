                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, congestion, and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Pathcy opacities in the left lower lobe suggest
 pneumonia, perhaps best depicted on the lateral view.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 resolution.
