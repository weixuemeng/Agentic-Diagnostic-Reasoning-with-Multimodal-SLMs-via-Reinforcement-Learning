                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, with moderate cardiomegaly.  Multiple intact sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal surgical clips, relate to prior CABG.  Left internal
 jugular approach central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. 
 Interval increase in the left basal opacification, likely represents a
 combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  Right basal opacities have
 slightly improved since the prior study and likely represent atelectasis. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild increase in the left basilar opacification, likely a combination of
 pleural effusion and consolidation, likely atelectasis.  Stable mild pulmonary
 edema.
