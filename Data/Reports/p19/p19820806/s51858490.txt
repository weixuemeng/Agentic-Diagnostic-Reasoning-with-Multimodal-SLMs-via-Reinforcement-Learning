                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:36 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and dyspnea.  Suspect pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 11:38 a.m.:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion has improved since
 earlier in the day, 12:19 a.m.  The resurgence of somewhat asymmetric
 interstitial abnormality in the right lung, accompanied by slight increase in
 heart size is probably asymmetric edema, but needs to be followed to exclude
 pneumonia, particularly one due to aspiration.  Pleural effusion is small on
 the right if any, absent on the left.  No pneumothorax.  Transvenous right
 atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator system is unchanged in position of
 the respective leads.  No pneumothorax.
