                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Foreign body removal.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___, ___, and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine frontal image of the chest.  Pacemaker,
 leads, median sternotomy wires, and mediastinal surgical clips are stable. 
 Lung volumes are low.  There has been interval increase in bilateral
 interstitial markings, which could be due differences in technique or to mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral interstitial markings, which could
 be due differences in technique or to mild pulmonary edema.  If clinical
 concern for pulmonary edema exists, could obtain upright radiographs for
 better assessment of lungs.
