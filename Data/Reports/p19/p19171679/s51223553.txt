 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with vomiting and wrenching and abdominal pain. 
 Free air under the diaphragm?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is probably normal, and crowd
 pulmonary vasculature, particularly at the lung bases, but lungs are probably
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy and no
 free subdiaphragmatic gas.
