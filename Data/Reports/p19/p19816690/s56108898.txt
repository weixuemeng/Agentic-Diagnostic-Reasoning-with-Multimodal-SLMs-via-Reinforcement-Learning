                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right pigtail placement, assess pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 earlier the same day.  There is a new right-sided pigtail catheter identified
 projecting over the right mid thorax.  Right-sided pneumothorax is not clearly
 identified based on this portable supine film.  Lungs are again notable for
 faint bibasilar opacities compatible with laceration/contusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right pigtail catheter.  No visualized pneumothorax on this
 portable supine film.
