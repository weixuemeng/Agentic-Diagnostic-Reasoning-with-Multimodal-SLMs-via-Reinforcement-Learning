                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PV now with PE and worsening wheezing  //
 Please assess for pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:49 pm.  Targeted review of
 chest CTA from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, subsegmental atelectasis at both bases is
 significantly increased.  The possibility of associated early infiltrates
 cannot be excluded, though no frank consolidation is seen.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is mild vascular
 plethora, without overt CHF.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased streaky opacities at both bases are most suggestive of increased
 bibasilar atelectasis.  The possibility of early infectious infiltrates is
 considered less likely, but cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution again seen.  Doubt overt CHF.
