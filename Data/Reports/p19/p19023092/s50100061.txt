                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia with sharp chest pain, please
 evaluate for infection.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are again noted.  There is a right perihilar opacity which is new
 from the prior exam and could represent a pseudo tumor/loculated pleural
 effusion with the possibility of atelectasis / infection also within the
 differential.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart remains top-normal in
 size.  The mediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral effusions with right perihilar opacity which could represent
 loculated pleural effusion versus atelectasis / pneumonia.  Followup to
 resolution is advised.
