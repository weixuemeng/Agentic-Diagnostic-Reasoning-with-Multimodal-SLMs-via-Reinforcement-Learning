 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly with a postoperative mediastinal contour
 unchanged from the prior exam.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis are minimally
 changed from prior examination with slight increase in right effusion tracking
 superiorly along the pleural surface as on prior CT.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear without focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bibasilar pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. 
 Slight increased in amount of right effusion tracking along the pleural
 surface.  No evidence of edema or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
