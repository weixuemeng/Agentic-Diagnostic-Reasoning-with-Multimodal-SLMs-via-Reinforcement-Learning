                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with multiple prior studies, most recent of which is dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are again noted.  Bilateral pleural effusions again noted. 
 There is an ovoid opacity within the right mid-to-lower lung which is slightly
 increased from prior study and could represent a pseudotumor (loculated fluid
 within the fissure).  Consider CT to further assess.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions are small, with increasing size of
 ovoid opacity in the right mid lung, which likely represents loculated pleural
 fluid, though given lack of confirmation of this finding, a CT of the chest
 may be performed to further assess.
