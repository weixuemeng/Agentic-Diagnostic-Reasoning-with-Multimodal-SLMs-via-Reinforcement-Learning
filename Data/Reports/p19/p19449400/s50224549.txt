                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hyoxia  // acute
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous ___ radiographs on PACs record for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lordotic and slightly rotated positioning.  Possibility of background
 hyperinflation/COPD cannot be excluded.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is
 slight prominence of the ascending aorta and scattered aortic calcifications. 
 The descending aorta is grossly unremarkable.  Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  No CHF,
 focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis is likely present.
 
 Focal calcification overlying the left neck is suggestive of carotid artery
 calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible background changes of hyperinflation/COPD.  Clinical correlation
 and, if clinically indicated, a lateral view could help further assessment.
 2. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 3. Mild prominence of the ascending aorta, disproportionate to the descending
 aorta.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this can be associated with
 hypertension or aortic stenosis.
 4. Probable left carotid artery calcification.
