                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dementia and possible hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 Bilateral and diffuse increased interstitial markings likely represents mild
 interstitial edema. More focal opacity at the right lung base is probably
 atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are better seen on CT. 
 Scarring in the right mid lung is unchanged from ___.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is top normal.  There are aortic knob
 calcifications.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild interstitial edema. Repeat
 radiograph could be performed after treatment to evaluate for underlying
 pneumonia.
