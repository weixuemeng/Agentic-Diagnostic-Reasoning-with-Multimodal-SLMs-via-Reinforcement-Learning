                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.  History of smoking.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A very small area of peribronchial opacity is seen in the right mid
 lung zone, which may represent a small pneumonia.  Could consider shallow
 obliques for better evaluation of this area.  There is no edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very small right peribronchial opacity may be a small pneumonia. 
 Can consider shallow obliques for better evaluation of this area if clinically
 warranted.
