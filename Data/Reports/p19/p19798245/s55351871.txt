                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, known ascites, head trauma, distended
 abdomen, right femur deformity.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There are
 low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflective
 of atelectasis though infection is not excluded. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is is identified.  There is a suggestion of
 subcutaneous emphysema within the left lateral chest wall. No displaced
 fractures are visualized. Remote right-sided posterior rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Suggestion of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall raises concern
 for a rib fracture though none are clearly seen.
 2. Low lung volumes. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.
