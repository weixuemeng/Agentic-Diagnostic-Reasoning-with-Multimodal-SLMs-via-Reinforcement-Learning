                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrate the nasogastric tube extending
 at least into the stomach.  Low lung volumes emphasize the cardiac silhouette,
 with the heart likely top normal in size.  There is bibasilar linear
 atelectasis, right greater than left.  There is no large pleural effusion, and
 no pneumothorax.  A skin fold overlying the right upper lung should not be
 confused for a pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Nasogastric tube extending into the stomach.  
 
 2. Bibasilar linear atelectasis, right greater than left.
