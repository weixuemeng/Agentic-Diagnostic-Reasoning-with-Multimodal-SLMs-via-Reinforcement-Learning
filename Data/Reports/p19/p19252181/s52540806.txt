                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Hx asbestos exposure  // ?asbestosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits without change. Lungs are
 clear except for chronic focal linear left basilar scar.  There are no pleural
 effusions, and no calcified pleural plaques are evident.  Right hemidiaphragm
 is chronically elevated, probably due to eventration of the anterior and
 midportions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with no findings to suggest
 asbestosis.  High-resolution chest CT is more sensitive than conventional
 radiographs for detecting subtle interstitial lung abnormalities and may be
 considered if clinical suspicion persists.
