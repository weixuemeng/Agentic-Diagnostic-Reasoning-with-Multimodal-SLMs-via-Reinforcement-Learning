                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent cardiac arrest, GI bleed, respiratory
 failure with likely aspiration pneumonia  // Interval change in pneumonia vs.
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previous median sternotomy noted.  Monitoring and supportive equipment is
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly with
 prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary vessels consistent with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  Airspace opacity
 at the right lung base likely reflects pulmonary edema but infection cannot be
 excluded.
