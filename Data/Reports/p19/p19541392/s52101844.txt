                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for edema or infiltration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is diffuse interstitial opacity with engorgement
 of the central vasculature, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Heart is
 moderately enlarged but unchanged. There is a small right pleural effusion. A
 retrocardiac opacity presumably reflects a component of pleural effusion and
 overlying atelectasis and appears similar to ___. A superimposed infection be
 difficult to exclude. Sternotomy wires and an aortic valve prosthesis are
 constant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema.
  2. Retrocardiac opacity is presumably component of pleural effusion and
 overlying atelectasis. A superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.
