 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  However, no confluent consolidation is
 identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 overt interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite pneumonia. Chronic moderate
 cardiomegaly.
