                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and cough for three days.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right upper lobe opacity is consistent with pneumonia.  THere is
 a faint suggestion of a "finger in glove" appearence.  Indistinctness of the
 right heart border suggests an additional right middle lobe consolidation.  No
 effusion, nodule, or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  A 2.8 x 4.8cm calcified structure projects over the
 liver.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper lobe, and possibly right middle lobe pneumonia.  Given upper
 lobe involvement, risk factors for TB should be evaluated.  The appearence may
 also fit with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
 
 2.  5cm calcified liver lesion is, in retrospect, unchanged since ___
 when it appears incidentally in the outer field of view of a lumbar spine
 radiograph.  Suggest correlation with prior imaging or consideration of a
 liver ultrasound.  
 
 The finding of right upper lobe pnuemonia was communicated with phone with Dr
 ___ at ___ on ___.  Additional differentials and finding 2 were
 communicated with Dr ___ ___ email at ___.
