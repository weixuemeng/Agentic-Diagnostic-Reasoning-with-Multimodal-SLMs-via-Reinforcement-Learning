                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, concurrent chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two frontal views of the chest was obtained portably.  A left
 port-A-Cath ends in the upper SVC. Since ___, there is improved aeration
 of the bilateral lung fields. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis,
 scarring or residual consolidation, right worse than left, similar to the
 prior study.  Small pleural effusions are better seen on concurrent CT. Heart
 size is normal. There is mild aortic tortuosity. The nipple projecting over
 the right lower lung should not be mistaken for a lung nodule. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved aeration since ___. Bibasilar opacities, right
 more than left, may be atelectasis or residual consolidation.
