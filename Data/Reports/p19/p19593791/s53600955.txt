                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ sup o2 requirement, fevers to 103, 8L fluid  // assess for
 acute process vs atalectasis      assess for acute process vs atalectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes are chronically low.  Cardiac silhouette is minimally larger. 
 There is new right perihilar opacification and fullness in the right lower
 paratracheal station of the mediastinum.  There 3 ways these to explain this: 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema and mediastinal venous engorgement ; 2.  A right
 hilar mass, postobstructive pneumonia, and ipsilateral lower paratracheal
 adenopathy ; 3.  Right lung pneumonia, leading to cardiac decompensation.  I
 favor the third possibility, but careful clinical and radiographic followup is
 recommended.
 
 Scarring or chronic subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung is unchanged. 
 Distension of the segment of colon interposed between the liver and right
 hemidiaphragm is chronic.
