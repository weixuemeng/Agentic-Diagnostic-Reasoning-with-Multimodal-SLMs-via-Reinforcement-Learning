                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MS, nephrolithiasis s/p PCNL c/b sepsis with
 desats to ___'s and new O2 requirement.  // rule out pneumonia     rule out
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 08:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 13:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes remain low with streaky opacity at the left base 's favoring
 atelectasis.  Overall, there is increasing hazy opacity within the right lung
 which may reflect a combination of increasing airspace disease as well as
 layering pleural fluid.  These findings, given the asymmetry, would be
 concerning for evolving pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  No pneumothorax.  Interposition of the colon beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm and liver consistent with Chiladiti's.
