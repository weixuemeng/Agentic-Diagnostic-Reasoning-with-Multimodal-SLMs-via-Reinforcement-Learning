                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD, now presenting with
 dyspnea and cough.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, latest one PA and lateral
 radiograph from ___ and CT of the chest on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Flattening of the diaphragms is consistent with known history of
 emphysema.  Increased vascular marking with upper redistribution and
 interstitial thickening is present. Ill defined opacities are noted in both
 lung bases.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted, left worse than
 right, with concurrent bibasilar atelectases.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly and severe degenerative changes of the right
 AC joint are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysematous lungs with superimposed pulmonary edema.
 Superimposed bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.
