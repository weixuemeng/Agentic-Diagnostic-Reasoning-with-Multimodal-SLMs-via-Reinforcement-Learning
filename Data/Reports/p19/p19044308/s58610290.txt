                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with congestive cardiac failure, increased
 shortness of breath with exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Cardiomegaly is unchanged from the prior
 examination.  Bilateral lungs appear clear with no focal consolidation. 
 Hyperinflated lungs and flattening of the diaphragms appear consistent with
 known history of emphysema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles, especially
 on the lateral views, may represent pleural effusions.  There has been
 improvement in the interstitial edema since the most recent prior examination.
