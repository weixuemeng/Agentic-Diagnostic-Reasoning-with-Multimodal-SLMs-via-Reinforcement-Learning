                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with question of recrudescence of stroke, please eval for
 occult pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present.  The aorta is
 tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the knob.  There is
 likely a moderate-sized hiatal hernia.  Hilar contours are normal.  No
 pulmonary edema seen.  Linear and streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Lungs are hyperinflated with relative
 attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggestive of
 emphysema.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is duct identified. 
 Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.  Emphysema and
 probable moderate size hiatal hernia.
