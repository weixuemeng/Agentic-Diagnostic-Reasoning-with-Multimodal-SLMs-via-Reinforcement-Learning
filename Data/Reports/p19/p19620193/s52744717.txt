                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, fever, nausea and vomiting.  Please
 evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Lungs are symmetrically expanded.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Linear bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A subtle increased opacity in the right lower lobe, likely
 represents subsegmental atelectasis, very early pneumonia not excluded.
