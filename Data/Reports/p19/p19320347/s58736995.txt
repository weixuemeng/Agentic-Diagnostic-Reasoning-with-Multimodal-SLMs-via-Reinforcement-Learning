                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with fever, rhonchi  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation made to concurrent CT abdomen pelvis.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Increased opacity on
 the lateral view over lower spine is compatible with sclerosis of the
 vertebral bodies likely degenerative.  Linear opacities at the right lateral
 costophrenic angle is likely due to scarring and atelectasis as seen on CT. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
