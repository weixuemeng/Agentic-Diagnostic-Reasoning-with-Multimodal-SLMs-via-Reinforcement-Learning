                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New dyspnea.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The overall appearance is similar to the film from ___ at 8:25 a.m.  
 
 There is possible slightly more pronounced and more confluent opacities in the
 left upper zone which could represent progression of known multifocal
 pneumonias or, less likely, some superimposed CHF. Small left pleural effusion
 may have increased slightly. 
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, sternotomy wires, and diffuse multifocal opacities
 consistent with the previously provided history of multifocal pneumonia.
