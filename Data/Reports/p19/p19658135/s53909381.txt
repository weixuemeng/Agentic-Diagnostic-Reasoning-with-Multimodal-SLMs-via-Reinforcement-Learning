                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.  Patient with HIV,
 hypotension, elevated white blood count.
 
 Comparison is made to multiple prior studies including ___ chest
 x-ray and ___ CT.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Small right effusion has decreased.  Extensive
 bilateral consolidation throughout the right lung and left upper lobe are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Tenting of
 the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged and consistent with scarring/atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse opacities are most likely due to pneumonia.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
