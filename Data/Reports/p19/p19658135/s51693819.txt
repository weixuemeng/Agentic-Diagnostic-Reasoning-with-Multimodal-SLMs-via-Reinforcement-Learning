                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Diffuse
 parenchymal opacities, more pronounced in the right lung base, are slightly
 improved compared to the previous study, suggestive of slight interval
 improvement in multifocal pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists.  Small right pleural effusion is also unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse parenchymal opacities, more pronounced in the right lung base,
 minimally improved overall compared to the previous exam, but remains
 compatible with multifocal pneumonia.  There is persistent mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and a small right pleural effusion.
