                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:12 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with HIV, multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The concurrent improvement in bilateral perihilar consolidation and right
 pleural effusion over just 24 hours suggests a large component of cardiac
 edema.  The lucencies in the consolidation, particularly in the right lung
 could be bullae, rather than cavities.  Although I have no reason to doubt
 there is concurrent pneumonia, I think the contribution of heart failure and
 pulmonary edema has been underestimated.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
