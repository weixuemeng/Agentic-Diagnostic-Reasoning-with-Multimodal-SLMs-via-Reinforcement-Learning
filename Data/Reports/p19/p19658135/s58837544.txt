 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema status post diuresis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral upper lung opacities have improved considerably since the
 prior study.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated with upward tenting which
 may be due to scarring or atelectasis.  There is residual lateral opacity in
 the right lung as well as focal left perihilar opacity.  Persistent opacities
 may be due in part to clearing edema versus persistent multifocal pneumonia. 
 There are probably trace pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
