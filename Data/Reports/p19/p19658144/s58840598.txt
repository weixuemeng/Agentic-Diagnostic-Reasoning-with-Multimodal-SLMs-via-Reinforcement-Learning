                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia  // eval for infection vs
 pulmonary edema; can be done at 7:15am rounds      eval for infection vs
 pulmonary edema; can be done at 7:15am rounds
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there are
 improved lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or
 mildly enlarged and there is some tortuosity of the descending aorta.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mild opacification at the left base with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with small pleural effusion and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Unusual appearance to the upper trachea
 probably represents the patient turning the head to the left, rather than an a
 right thyroid mass.
