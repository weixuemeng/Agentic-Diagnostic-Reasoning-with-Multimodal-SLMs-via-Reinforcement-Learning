                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 aorta is partly calcified.  Bilateral nipple shadows are visualized.  Fine
 reticulation in the periphery of the basilar portions of the lungs suggesting
 interstitial changes is similar since the prior study without evidence for a
 superimposed process.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.  The bones are probably demineralized to some degree.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar mild interstitial process.  Status post aortic valve
 replacement.  Suspected bony demineralization.
