                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with headache, neck pain, cough, diffuse LUE pain
 and R knee pain s/p fall  // fracture or bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact.  Right pectoral infusion port terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Prosthetic aortic valve and TAVR is in unchanged
 position.  Lung volume is low.  Chronic interstitial fibrosis is similar to
 before.  Focal areas of increased opacity in the periphery of the right mid
 and left lower lungs appear more conspicuous than on the prior radiograph, but
 lower lung volumes limit comparison.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased constant acuity of right mid and left lower lung opacities,
 possibly due to accentuation by lower lung volumes.  Followup PA and lateral
 radiographs would be helpful for more complete assessment when the patient's
 condition allows, in order to exclude developing pneumonia at either of the
 sites.  .
 2. Extensive interstitial fibrosis.
