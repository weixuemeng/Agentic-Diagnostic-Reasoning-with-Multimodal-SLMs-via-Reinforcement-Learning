 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 23:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema appears unchanged.
 Possible small stable right pneumothorax, although this may just represent
 overlying subcutaneous emphysema. Status post median sternotomy with stable
 overall cardiac and mediastinal contours.  A right internal jugular
 Port-A-Cath remains unchanged in position.  Bibasilar opacities are again seen
 suggestive of atelectasis, although the appearance is slightly more
 consolidative at the left base raising concern for developing pneumonia. No
 pulmonary edema.
