                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  cOUGH, CHEST CONGESTION // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior chest radiographs, no significant change is
 appreciated.  Diffuse interstitial opacities appear unchanged. Obscuration of
 the right heart border also appears unchanged compared to many prior chest
 radiographs, likely due to adjacent pericardial fat silhouetting the
 diaphragm.  Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged without pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary
 edema. A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC. Median
 sternotomy wires are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormalities.  Chronic interstitial changes likely due to known bleomycin
 toxicity.
