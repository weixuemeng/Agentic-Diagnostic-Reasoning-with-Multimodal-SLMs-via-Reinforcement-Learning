 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and stable prosthetic aortic valve are noted.
 Considerably calcified aortic knob and intact sternal wires are noted. The
 lungs are hyperinflated with streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis and minimal interstitial reticulation in the periphery, better
 seen on the current CT, likely representing chronic interstitial changes. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Osseous structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative change in thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis, but no evidence for
 pneumonia.
