                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Hodgkin lymphoma on chemo, new
 non-productive cough, c/f pna  // PNA,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study with
 borderline cardiomegaly.  Previous median sternotomy noted and calcification
 aortic arch.  There are peripheral subpleural reticular opacities at the lung
 bases suggestive of interstitial lung disease.  This is similar in appearance
 when compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions seen. 
 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  There has been prior aortic valve
 replacement.  The bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearances are very similar when compared to the prior study. 
 Peripheral reticular opacities of the lung bases are difficult to evaluate and
 further evaluation with CT of the chest could be performed if there is concern
 for interstitial lung disease.
