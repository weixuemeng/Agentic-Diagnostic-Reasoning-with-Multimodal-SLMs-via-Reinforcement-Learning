 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:43 AM
  Low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Interval development
  of increasing bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis, however
  pneumonia or aspiration could be considered in the appropriate clinical
  setting.  Grossly stable extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  No large
  pneumothorax.
  
  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
  ___ ___ at 11:16 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening tachypnea  // eval for worsening
 ptx      eval for worsening ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 11:29.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumomediastinum persists, more apparent, but not necessarily worse.  Extent
 of extrapleural emphysema in the right chest and minimal pneumothorax if any
 is unchanged.  Increased opacification at the base of the left lung laterally
 is probably atelectasis.  Atelectasis at both lung bases is also more
 pronounced.  Heart is normal size, given low lung volumes.
 
 The extent of subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck bilaterally
 has not appreciably changed.
 
 Right supraclavicular central venous infusion port ends the right atrium.
