                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Poor p.o. intake and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette as well
 as causing vascular crowding.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  There is mild prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature without frank interstitial edema.  There is a
 trace right-sided pleural effusion with fluid tracking along the minor
 fissure.  A ring-like density projects over the right upper lung field
 measuring roughly 2.6 cm without clear lateral correlate.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload and trace right-sided
 effusion.
 
 2.  A 2.6 cm ring density projecting over the right upper lung field without
 clear lateral correlate.  Recommend oblique views for further characterization
 as well as acquisition of prior studies for comparison, if available.
