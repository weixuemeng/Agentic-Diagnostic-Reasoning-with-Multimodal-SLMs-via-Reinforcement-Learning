                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation given history of altered mental status. 
 Please evaluate ET tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The ET tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  There is an
 enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the proximal
 stomach; however, with the side port at the gastroesophageal junction, and
 must be advanced.  
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta appears to be tortuous.   Apparent shift
 of the mediastinal structures to the right may be rotational; however, there
 is also a component of volume loss in the right lung, with evidence of
 atelectasis and asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is an
 area of increased lucency at the right lung base below the minor fissure,
 which could be secondary to a large bulla given patient's history of COPD or a
 loculated pneumothorax.  
 
 The left lung appears to be clear.  At the upper right lung there is a nodular
 opacity measuring 1.1 cm x 1.1 cm.  Linear fibrotic opacities at the medial
 right lung base is consistent with scarring. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates appropriately above the carina of approximately 2.5 cm.
 
 2.  Nodular opacity in the upper right lung measures 1.1 cm x 1.1 cm unclear
 whether artifactual and possibly external to the patient or a true nodule;
 close attention on followup imaging is recommended, given concern for
 malignancy.
 
 3.  Area of hyperlucency at the right lung base may be secondary to a bulla
 given patient's history of COPD or a loculated pneumothorax.  This is of
 indeterminate chronicity given absence of priors.
 
 4.  Enteric tube appears to terminate at the proximal stomach; however, the
 side port is in the distal esophagus, and should be advanced so that it is
 well within the stomach.
