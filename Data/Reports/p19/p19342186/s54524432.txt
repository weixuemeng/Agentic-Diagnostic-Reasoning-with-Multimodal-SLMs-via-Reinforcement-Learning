                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fall, found down after two days, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained and compared with a
 prior study from ___.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  An opacity is seen in the
 right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure which could represent a pneumonic
 consolidation and/or atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable with an
 unfolded thoracic aorta.   Bony structures appear intact.  No displaced rib
 fractures are seen.  Old right mid rib cage deformity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe abutting the minor
 fissure, may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute
 findings.
