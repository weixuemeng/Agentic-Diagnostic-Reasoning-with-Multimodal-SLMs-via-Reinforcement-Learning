 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Severe COPD, evaluation for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  The opacity, likely pneumonia, in the right upper lobe is
 unchanged.  Also unchanged is massive overinflation, predominantly at the lung
 bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant in appearance.
