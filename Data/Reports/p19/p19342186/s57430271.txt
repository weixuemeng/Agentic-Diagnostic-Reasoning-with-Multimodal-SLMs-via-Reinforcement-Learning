                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New left IJ line, evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:29.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular
 central venous catheter, terminating in the proximal SVC/SVC brachiocephalic
 junction, without new pneumothorax seen.  The left lung is hyperinflated and
 relatively lucent, likely due to underlying COPD.  There is a large lucency
 projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung which may represent a large bleb,
 underlying loculated pneumothorax is not excluded.  Opacity at the right upper
 lung is again seen, which may be due to some volume loss, underlying
 aspiration, infection not excluded.  Previously noted nodular opacity
 projecting over the right upper lung is no longer appreciated. No priors
 available for comparison.  There is scarring and evidence of some volume loss
 on the right with some shift of the mediastinum to the right, correlate with
 history of prior procedure to the right hemithorax/lung.  Endotracheal tube is
 approximately 2.5 cm at the level of the carina.  The nasogastric tube is
 similar in appearance, with side port at the GE junction/distal esophagus and
 in the very proximal stomach.  As suggested previously, recommend advancement
 so that it is well within the stomach.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left internal jugular catheter terminating
 at the SVC/brachiocephalic junction/proximal SVC without evidence of new
 pneumothorax.  Previously noted nodular opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung is no longer appreciated.  Otherwise, the remainder of the lung
 fields is similar, see above.
