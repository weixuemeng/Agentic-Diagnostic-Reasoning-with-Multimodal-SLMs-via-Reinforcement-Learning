                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent homogeneous band-like area of opacification in right
 upper lobe anteriorly adjacent to a slightly elevated minor fissure.  A
 similar but smaller opacity was evident on a more remote radiograph of ___ and also on ___.  The appearance favors focal atelectasis over an
 infectious pneumonia, and may be accompanied by a small amount of fluid within
 the adjacent elevated fissure.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for
 hyperinflation and nonspecific linear scarring at the right base.  Small
 pleural effusions versus pleural thickening are present at the posterior
 costophrenic angles.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is diffusely tortuous
 without change.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent focal right perifissural opacity favoring an area of
 atelectasis over infectious pneumonia.
 2.  Hyperinflation of the lungs in keeping with previously provided history of
 COPD.
