                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 streaky basilar opacification suggesting atelectasis, overall with volume
 loss, but an infectious process could be considered, particularly regarding a
 patchy left lower lobe opacity on the lateral view.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left lower lobe opacity.  This may be consistent with
 pneumonia, but atelectasis could also be considered as the etiology, in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
