                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  Mild cardiac enlargement as before
 with contour prominence of the left ventricle in posterior direction. 
 Thoracic aorta mildly widened and elongated, but without local contour
 abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The uneven
 peripheral vascular distribution, which includes areas of increased
 translucency are consistent with COPD and appear similar as on the previous
 examination.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any
 effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on the
 frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, pulmonary vascular changes, and low
 positioned diaphragms compatible with COPD.  No acute infiltrates presently.
