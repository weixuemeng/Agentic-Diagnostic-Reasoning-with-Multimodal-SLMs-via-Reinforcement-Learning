                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with COPD and increased shortness of breath,
 cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Again, the lungs are hyperinflated.  There are new
 regions of consolidation in the right lung within the upper and middle lobes. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear of confluent consolidation.  Mild right apical
 scarring is again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Hyperinflation with regions of consolidation in the right lung. 
 These are compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Recommend
 repeat after treatment to document resolution.
