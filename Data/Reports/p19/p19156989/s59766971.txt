 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Decreased breath sounds, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, most of the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities have completely resolved.  On neither the frontal nor
 the lateral radiograph, there is evidence of a recent pneumonia.  Large lung
 volumes suggesting the presence of overinflation.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
