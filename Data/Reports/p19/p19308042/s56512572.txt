                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M now intubated evaluate for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study an endotracheal tube has been placed which
 terminates 4.5 cm from the carina, directed slightly at the right tracheal
 wall.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the
 duodenum.  Extensive parenchymal abnormality including chronic interstitial
 process with superimposed parenchymal opacities likely representing pneumonia
 is grossly unchanged from the recent prior study.  There is no pneumothorax,
 or right-sided pleural effusion.  A probable small left pleural effusion is
 similar to the prior study.  There is also probably a superimposed
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  A left pectoral pacemaker and its 3 leads
 project in unchanged location.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval intubation and placement of an enteric tube, which appear well
 positioned.
 2. Unchanged extensive chronic interstitial abnormality with superimposed
 airspace opacities likely representing pneumonia.  There is also probably
 superimposed mild interstitial edema
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:14 PM, 15 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
