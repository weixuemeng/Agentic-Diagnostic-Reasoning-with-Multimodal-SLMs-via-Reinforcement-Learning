                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chronic interstitial reticular opacities are similar to multiple prior studies
 with new superimposed airspace opacities likely representing pneumonia in
 bilateral lung bases, particularly in the retrocardiac area.  There is likely
 a left pleural effusion as well.  There is no pneumothorax or definite
 pulmonary edema or right pleural effusion.  A left pectoral pacemaker projects
 in unchanged location with interval addition of a second coronary sinus lead. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged, partially silhouetted
 by diffuse parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial process with superimposed airspace opacities likely
 representing pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:12 PM, 15 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
