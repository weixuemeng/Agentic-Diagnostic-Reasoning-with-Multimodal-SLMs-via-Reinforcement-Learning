                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old male with HIV CD4 count 180, not taking meds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view may relate to vascular structures however, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight increase in retrocardiac opacity on the lateral view most likely
 relates to vascular structures, but underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  No diffuse opacity is seen to
 suggest PCP, ___, chest CT is more sensitive in evaluating for PCP.
