                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ 10:05 P.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure.  Please evaluate
 endotracheal tube and central venous line location.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 18:10.
 
 Single portable AP semi-upright chest film dated ___ at 10:05 p.m. is
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube now has its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 3
 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube continues to have its side port in
 the distal esophagus and advancement is continued to be recommended.  Right
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC.
 
 2.  Lung volumes remain low with persistent linear opacity in the right mid
 lung consistent with subsegmental atelectasis and persistent retrocardiac
 consolidation which likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although
 a pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
