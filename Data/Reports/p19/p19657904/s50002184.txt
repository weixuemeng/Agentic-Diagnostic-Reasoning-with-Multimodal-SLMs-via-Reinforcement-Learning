 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:06 PM
  Endotracheal tube in right mainstem bronchus. Retracting approximately 3 cm is
  recommended. Right internal jugular line with tip projecting over low SVC.
  Orogastric tube tip projecting over left upper quadrant, likely within the
  stomach, but has been retracted with side port now above diaphragm; advancing
  the tube is recommended. Low lung volumes. Possible left pleural effusion.
  Findings and recommendations discussed with ___ ___ by phone at 20:59 on
  ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 6:25 P.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, check placement of
 endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 18:06.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 6:25 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip in the right main stem
 bronchus.  A wet reading was again provided to ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ on ___ at 20:59.  Repositioning was advised.  Right internal jugular
 central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. 
 Nasogastric tube has now been retracted and the side port is in the distal
 esophagus.  Advancement is also advised of this tube.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with persistent linear opacity in the right mid lung
 consistent with subsegmental atelectasis and retrocardiac consolidation with
 air bronchograms likely representing lower lobe atelectasis given the position
 of the endotracheal tube being in the right main stem bronchus.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
