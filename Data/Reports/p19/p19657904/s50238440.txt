 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2 cm above
 the carina.  The nasogastric tube has been advanced with its tip coursing
 below the diaphragm and not definitively identified on this study.  Right
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC.
 
 2.  The heart is enlarged but stable.  There is improving aeration in the
 retrocardiac area and a persistent linear opacity in the right mid lung which
 likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
