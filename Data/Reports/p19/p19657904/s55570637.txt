                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Again seen minimal blunting of costophrenic
 angles, probable pleural thickening.   The aorta is generally large, very
 tortuous, but stable in appearance longterm. Moderate to severe enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is also chronic due to a combination of cardiomegaly
 and pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly, some pericardial effusion, generally large and
 tortuous aorta.
