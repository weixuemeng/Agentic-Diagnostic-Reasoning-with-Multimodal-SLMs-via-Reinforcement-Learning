                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with asthma and respiratory failure, check
 for orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  When compared with the prior study, the endotracheal tube still has its
 tip in the right mainstem bronchus and there is increasing retrocardiac
 consolidation likely representing left lower lobe collapse.  Right internal
 jugular central line and nasogastric tube appear unchanged in position.  There
 is persistent linear opacity in the right lung which likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
