                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with asthma and CHF status post extubation. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 21:56.
 
 Single portable upright chest film, ___ at 4:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. 
 Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities and likely layering
 effusions suggestive of compressive atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged. 
 Overall mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, given differences in
 positioning and technique between studies.  Degenerative changes of the
 acromioclavicular joint.  Cystic changes within an incompletely visualized
 right humeral head, possibly related to degenerative change or remote trauma.
