                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness, h/o CNS tumor on chemotherapy and XRT,
 evaluate for bleed or infection
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Slight increased opacity in the right mid lung with air bronchogram is most
 likely due to atelectasis and/or overlap of vascular structures, but in
 appropriate clinical setting early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Left lung is
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mid lung opacity is likely atelectasis, however early pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
