                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with EKG changes.  // Rule out ACS
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Dual lead pacer is unchanged
 with leads extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle.  The
 heart remains mildly enlarged.  There is prominence of the right pulmonary
 hilum which appears new from the prior exam and may in part reflect patient's
 position.  Upper lung lucency suggest emphysema.  No focal consolidation,
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No signs of edema or congestion. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of emphysema.  Prominence of the right pulmonary hilum
 which may be further assessed on a nonemergent chest CT exam.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  Otherwise remarkable.
