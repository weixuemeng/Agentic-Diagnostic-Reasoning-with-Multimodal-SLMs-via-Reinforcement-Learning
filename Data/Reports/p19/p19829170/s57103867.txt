                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening cough for two months in patient with smoking history.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated, and there is
 increased AP diameter of the chest with minimal diaphragmatic flattening
 consistent with mild COPD.  The lungs are clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The pulmonary vascular markings are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cause of the patient's cough is identified.  However, the chest
 radiograph does not constitute a full evaluation of the bronchial tree; this
 would require a chest CT.
 2.  Radiographic evidence of mild COPD.
