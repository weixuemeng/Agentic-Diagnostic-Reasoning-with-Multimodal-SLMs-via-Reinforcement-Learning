 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and dual
 lead left-sided pacer unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar
 patchy opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Patchy opacities in the right lung are essentially stable
 and are concerning for an infectious process.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  No pneumothorax.
