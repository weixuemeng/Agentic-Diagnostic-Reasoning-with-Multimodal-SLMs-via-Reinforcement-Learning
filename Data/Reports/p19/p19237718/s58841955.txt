                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mitral regurgitation and previous pulmonary
 edema  // Is there pulmonary edema?      Is there pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  Opacification diffusely involves the right hemithorax,
 most likely representing asymmetric pulmonary edema in a patient with
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, evidence of previous
 cardiac surgery, and a biventricular pacer device in place.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia.
