                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MR ___/p MitraClip placement on ___  //
 Please eval for edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates
 just distal to the clavicles. The patient has had median sternotomy with CABG.
 A left pectoral AICD remains in place. A newly placed Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in the right descending pulmonary artery.  Retained pacer leads are
 in place.  There is no pneumothorax.  Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Bilateral airspace opacities are slightly improved. New retrocardiac airspace
 opacification is likely due to atelectasis.  Extensive splenic artery
 calcifications are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac airspace opacity is most likely due to atelectasis.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is minimally improved.
