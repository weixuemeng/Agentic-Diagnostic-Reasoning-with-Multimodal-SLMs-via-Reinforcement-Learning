 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___

 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the regions of the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette the appear slightly increased compared to the previous
 exam. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness is more pronounced on the right compared to left, and likely
 reflects asymmetric pulmonary edema, mild to moderate in degree.  Small right
 pleural effusion is noted. No pneumothorax is identified. S-shaped scoliosis
 of the thoracolumbar spine is present along with multilevel moderate
 degenerative changes.

 recommended to exclude infection in the right lung.
