 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.

 appropriate position.  NG tube with tip in the proximal stomach and is shifted
 leftwards from a large central paraseptal bullae as is seen on CT chest. 
 Vascular clips are noted, and the sternotomy wires are intact.  
 
 Stable bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  No additional focal
 opacity or pleural effusions. Lung apices are not imaged on this film, however
 no large pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and dilated, and is unchanged.
 Heart size is top normal and right hilus is normal.
