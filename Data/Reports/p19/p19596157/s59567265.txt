                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Uremia, PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 823.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line is difficult
 to visualize, given that there is overlay with two pacemaker leads and a left
 hemodialysis catheter.  The line can be traced down to the upper to mid SVC
 but is not visible beyond that point.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Unchanged appearance of the lung
 parenchyma and of the other monitoring and support devices.
