                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is marked
 cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and an ICD device, with lead tips, nominal
 in appearance.  The hila are prominent, raising the question of background
 pulmonary hypertension.  There is minimal blunting of the left and right
 costophrenic angles.  No definite superimposed pulmonary process.
