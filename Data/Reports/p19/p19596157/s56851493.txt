                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall, to rule out rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Marked cardiomegaly, is unchanged.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are stable, with moderate enlargement of both
 main pulmonary arteries.  The lungs are clear, without consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures
 are evident.  However, this study is not optimal for assessment of rib
 fractures.  If there is high concern for the same, a dedicated rib series with
 marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness is recommended.  A left chest
 wall AICD device is in place, with three leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle as before.  Multiple intact
 sternotomy wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
 2.  If there is high concern for nondisplaced rib fracture, dedicated rib
 series can be performed with marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
