                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:23 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  CHF.  New PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 2:48 p.m.:
 
 The right PICC line was previously visible in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Today, I can trace it only as far as the upper SVC,
 below which it might be obscured by the numerous catheters and pacer leads,
 and by cardiac motion.  If precise localization is needed, oblique views
 should be obtained in the department.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  There
 is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or appreciable pleural effusion.  Lungs
 are grossly clear.  Dialysis catheter ends in the right heart, transvenous
 pacer leads in the right atrium and along the left ventricle, and pacer
 defibrillator lead in the right ventricle, as far as one can tell from frontal
 radiograph alone.
