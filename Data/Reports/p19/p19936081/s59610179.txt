                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachpynea  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT abdomen from earlier the same day performed at___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings. Right basilar opacitiy is likely secondary to atelectasis. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable.  Enteric tube seen
 coiled in the pharynx and the tip is located in the distal esophagus.
 Branching hypodensities in the right upper quadrant are compatible with portal
 venous gas seen on prior CT. Massively distended loops of bowel seen in the
 abdomen without definite free intraperitoneal air based on this supine film.
 Excreted contrast seen within the renal collecting systems bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube coiled in the pharynx and repositioning is suggested.
 Portal venous gas as seen on prior CT. Distended loops of bowel without
 evidence of free intraperitoneal air on this supine film.
