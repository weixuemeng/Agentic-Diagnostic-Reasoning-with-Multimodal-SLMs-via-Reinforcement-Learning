                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hematuria and lethargy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Assessment of the chest is limited by patient rotation
 and the patient's chin obscuring assessment of the left apex. Heart size
 appears mildly enlarged but similar.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  There is no right-sided
 pneumothorax with assessment for a left apical pneumothorax being limited.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to rotation and obscuration of the left apex.  Low lung
 volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, but infection is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
