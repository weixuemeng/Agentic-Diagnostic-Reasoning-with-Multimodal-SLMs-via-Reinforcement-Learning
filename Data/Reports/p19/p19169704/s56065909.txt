                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough for two weeks, right
 posterior back pain, evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Normal
 dimension of thoracic aorta without evidence of local contour abnormalities. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 remain free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the
 thorax demonstrate some diffuse moderate degree of demineralization of the
 vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine but no evidence of vertebral body
 compression fracture is present.
 
 Similar as on previous examination is evidence of multiple surgical clips in
 the right lower chest area coinciding with deformity of the right-sided breast
 shadow is compatible with surgical lumpectomy intervention.  These findings
 appear stable.  The same holds for previously identified surgical clips in the
 left upper abdominal quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of acute infiltrates in this
 ___-year-old female patient with cough for two weeks.
