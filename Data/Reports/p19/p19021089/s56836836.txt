                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dementia, chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Increased opacity at the lung
 bases on the lateral is likely due to atelectasis given low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable given differences in patient
 positioning.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged, noting
 degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joints.  There is, however, mild
 lower thoracic/upper lumbar dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
