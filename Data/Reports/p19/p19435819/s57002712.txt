                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with three weeks of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated and clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is
 present.  An mild left convex contour in the AP window is unchanged since
 ___ and likely represents a vascular contour rather than
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable mild convex contour in
 the AP window.  This is almost certainly a normal vascular contour.  Repeat
 shallow oblique chest radiographs are suggested for confirmation.
