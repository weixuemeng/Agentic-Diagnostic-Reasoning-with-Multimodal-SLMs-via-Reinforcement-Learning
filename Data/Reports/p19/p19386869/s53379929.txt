                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Small bilateral effusions with
 adjacent opacities right greater than left are new.  The opacities are likely
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
