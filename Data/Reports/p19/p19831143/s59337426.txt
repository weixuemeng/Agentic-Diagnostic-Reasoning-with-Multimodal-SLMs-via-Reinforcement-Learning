                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough, rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  External
 artifact overlies the left lower hemithorax as well as the lateral right upper
 quadrant.  Per the radiology technologist, the patient refused to remove
 blankets overlying her.  Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No focal consolidation.  Suboptimal evaluation of the left inferior hemithorax
 due to overlying external artifact.  If high concern in this location,
 consider repeat after removal of the external artifact.
