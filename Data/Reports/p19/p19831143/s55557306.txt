                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right upper lobe nodule overlying the ___ posterior rib was seen on the
 prior CT and consistent with an intrapulmonary lymph node.  Again there is
 diffuse emphysema with overexpansion of the lungs. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidations, but ill defined bibasilar
 opacities are present which may relate to chronic changes or overlying soft
 tissue. Infection or aspiration is not excluded. PA and lateral views may be
 helpful.
