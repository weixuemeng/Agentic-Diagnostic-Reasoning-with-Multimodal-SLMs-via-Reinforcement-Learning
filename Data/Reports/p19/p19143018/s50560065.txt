                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Elevation of the hemidiaphragms is likely due to large
 volume ascites.  Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting of
 the costophrenic angles is similar to prior and consistent with small pleural
 effusions.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion with elevation of the hemidiaphragms from
 large volume ascites.
