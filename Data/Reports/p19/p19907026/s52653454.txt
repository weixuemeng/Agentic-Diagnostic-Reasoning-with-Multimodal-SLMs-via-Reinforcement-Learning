                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with worsening SOB, known CHF  // eval heart and
 lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by underpenetration secondary to patient's body habitus.
 The heart is markedly enlarged, but unchanged compared to the prior studies,
 which may reflect cardiomegaly or a pericardial effusion.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  The lung volumes are somewhat low, with bibasilar
 atelectasis, and pulmonary vascular congestion with peribronchial cuffing,
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Aorta is unfolded.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion. Multi level degenerative changes are again seen in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Stable marked cardiomegaly.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
