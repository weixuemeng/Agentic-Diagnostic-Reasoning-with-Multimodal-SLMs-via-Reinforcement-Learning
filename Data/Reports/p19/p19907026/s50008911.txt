                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, question acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Evaluation is
 markedly limited due to low lung volumes and under penetrated technique. 
 There is limited evaluation, possible at the lower lungs.  There is increased
 pulmonary opacity which could in part reflect technique, though the
 possibility of edema or infection is impossible to exclude.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours appear grossly stable.  No definite bony abnormalities
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam, findings as discussed above, for which a
 dedicated PA and lateral view would be advised to further assess.
