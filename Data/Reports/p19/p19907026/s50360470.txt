                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure with
 hypertension, dyspnea on exertion and asymmetric lower extremity edema. 
 Technique.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, similar
 compared to the previous exam.  The aorta remains unfolded.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, but this appears improved compared to the prior
 study.  No definite focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen though assessment lung bases is somewhat limited by
 underpenetration.  There are mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
