                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with smoke exposure  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is largely unremarkable for technique.  No significant
 abnormalities are seen of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is no definite
 peribronchial cuffing.  Mild right-sided basilar opacity.  An opacity is seen
 at the left lung base, with indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle. 
 This may represent basilar atelectasis, though difficult to exclude a
 developing pneumonia.
 
 Soft tissue calcifications are noted in the right supraclavicular region. 
 There is mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with associated volume loss.  Difficult to exclude a
 developing pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Consider dedicated PA
 and lateral views to better assess.
