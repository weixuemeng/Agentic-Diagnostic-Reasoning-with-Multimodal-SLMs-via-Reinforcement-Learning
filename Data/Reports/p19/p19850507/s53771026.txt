  Lung volumes are markedly low. There is opacity at the base of the right lung
  which likely represents a combination of small to moderate effusion as well as
  compressive atelectasis. Opacity at the base of the right lung could also
  represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting. The hypoinflated left
  lung appears clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with desaturations  // evaluate for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, there is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, combines to a small area of atelectasis at the right lung base.
 Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is also new. Lung volumes remain overall very
 low, with no signs of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists
