                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA and LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman complaining of shortness of breath; evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Triangular opacification of the left lower lobe is increased since the prior
 exam with new slight blunting of the adjacent left hemidiaphragm on the PA
 view and opacification of the retrocardiac space on the lateral view.  No
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly persists and
 is overall unchanged - previously had normal echocardiogram.  Mediastinal
 contours, hila, and pleura are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity is new, likely subsegmental atelectasis, but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Correlate with clinical assessment.
