                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Left posterior back pain, worse with inspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged, which is possibly significant noting the
 young age of the patient.  The lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent cardiac enlargement.  If the etiology for suspected cardiac
 enlargement is not known, then echocardiography should be considered in
 addition to correlation with other clinical factors.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
