                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a tender right posterior rib at the T7 level.
 Rule out fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen, but it should be noted that in general
 conventional chest radiographs are not sensitive means for detecting subtle
 chest cage trauma, and in this case the hemidiaphragm partially obscures the
 area of interest.  If the indication is to exclude rib fracture, then detailed
 views of carefully marked regions of point tenderness should be requested.
 
 Lungs are clear, pleural surface is normal.  Heart size top normal.  Normal
 hilar and pleural contours.
 
 On the lateral view, an ___-mm wide calcified oval shadow projects posterior to
 the trachea at the level of the aortic arch.  Diagnostic possibilities include
 a calcified aberrant (retroesophageal) right subclavian artery, calcified
 mediastinal lymph node, pulmonary calcification (not recognized on the frontal
 view).
