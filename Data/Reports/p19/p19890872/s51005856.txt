                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph from outside hospital obtained same
 day six hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates
 bilateral interstitial markings with cephalization of vessels and central
 vascular engorgement.  Obscuration of bilateral diaphragmatic angles may
 represent bilateral small pleural effusions, although a component of
 atelectasis or a consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is enlarged. Visualized osseous structures are without acute
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vascular congestion and interstitial markings compatible with
 interstitial edema. Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles compatible
 with pleural effusions, although component of atelectasis or focal
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
