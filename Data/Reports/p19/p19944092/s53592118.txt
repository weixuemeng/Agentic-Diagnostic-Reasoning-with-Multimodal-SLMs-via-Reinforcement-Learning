                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with colorectal cancer and metastases, presents
 with lower extremity weakness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to scout films from
 CT scan from ___.  Given differences in technique, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again seen are increased interstitial markings
 identified throughout the right lung, most notably at the base.  Increased
 soft tissue density at the right hilum is compatible with lymphadenopathy
 identified on CT scan.  There is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
 Right chest wall port via IJ is seen with catheter tip in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings in the right lung as seen on CT
 scan from almost two weeks prior.  This could be related to infection;
 however, metastatic disease is also possible.  Right hilar adenopathy is
 better delineated on prior CT scan.
