                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Query pneumonia and volume status.  Pleural plaques. Infiltrates on
 outside imaging.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS No previous ___ chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 AP view of the chest from___ dated ___ enetered into
 PACs.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  There is severe COPD, with hyperinflation, flattening of the
 diaphragms, and marked attenuation of the vessels in both lungs.  Superimposed
 on this, there is extensive pleural plaque formation, with large areas of
 pleural plaque calcification in both lungs, considerably obscuring underlying
 parenchymal detail.  There is pleural thickening along the posterior lower
 (?right) chest wall and along the right lower chest wall and right lung base,
 with blunting of the right costophrenic angle. 
 
 No obvious CHF or underlying infiltrate is detected in either lung. The left
 pleural costophrenic sulcus is clear.  Heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  
 
 There is probable diffuse osteopenia, with mild degenerative changes and
 possible minimal wedging of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Severe COPD, with extensive calcified pleural plaques in both lungs.  While
 there is no obvious infiltrate, CHF, or pulmonary nodule detected on either
 side, the extent of the pleural abnormalities markedly limits assessment of
 the underlying lung parenchyma. 
 
 2)Focally prominent pleural thickening, calcification, and/or fluid, at the
 right lung base. The fluid versus solid nature of this abnormality is not
 effectively assessed on this examination. 
 
 3) Further evaluation with chest CT scan is recommended to better characterize
 findings at the right lung base and to exclude underlying parenchymal
 pathology.
