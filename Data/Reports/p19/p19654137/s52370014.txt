                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative for small bowel obstruction and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been the development of
 increased opacification at the bases, most likely related to atelectatic
 changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, however, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 The upper lungs are clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
