                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with altered mental status after being struck by a car. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited due to low lung volumes and significant
 artifact from trauma board.  Allowing for this limitation, the endotracheal
 tube is seen ending approximately 4 cm above the carina and the esophageal
 tube ends below the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip out of view.  Low
 lung volumes accounting for bronchovascular crowding.  No cardiomegaly is
 identified.  Apparent widening of the vascular pedicle is likely due to
 position and low lung volumes. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate position of the endotracheal and esophageal tubes. 
 Low lung volumes.
