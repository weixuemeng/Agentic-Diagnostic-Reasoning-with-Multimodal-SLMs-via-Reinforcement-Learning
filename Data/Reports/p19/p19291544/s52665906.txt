                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with traumatic brain injury, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 6:11.
 
 Portable semierect chest film ___ at 6:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Left subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged
 in position.  Linear opacity at the right base persists, likely reflecting
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Lung volumes remain diminished and there is
 prominent pulmonary vasculature consistent with known elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No large effusions are appreciated.
