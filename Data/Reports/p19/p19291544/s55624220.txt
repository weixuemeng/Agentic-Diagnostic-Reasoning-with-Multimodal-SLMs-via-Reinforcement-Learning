                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epidural hematoma.  Evaluate tracheostomy placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: The intratracheal portion is
 approximately 8cm and the tip is 3.5 cm from the carina. Nasoenteric tube
 courses to the stomach with the tip out of view.  Left subclavian catheter
 ends in the mid SVC. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. 
 Left basilar opacity is presumably atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs are
 clear with improvement in left upper lung. There is no substantial pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with
 top normal heart size.
