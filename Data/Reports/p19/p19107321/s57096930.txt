                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:08
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post splenectomy with pleural
 effusion, assess fluid status.  Assess endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 6:09.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest films, ___ at 15:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is limited due to
 marked patient rotation on the current study.  The endotracheal tube lies
 3.6-cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There continue to be bilateral
 layering effusions, left greater than right.  There is fullness of the
 perihilar vasculature which likely represents mild perihilar edema.  It has
 not significantly changed since the prior study.  Bibasilar patchy opacities
 most likely reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Multiple left-sided posterolateral rib fractures.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
