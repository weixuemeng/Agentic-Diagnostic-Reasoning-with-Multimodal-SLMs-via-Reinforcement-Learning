                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post fall while intoxicated with
 right subdural hematoma, C2 fracture in collar, multiple left rib fractures
 with aspiration event, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  A right arm PICC
 line is again seen with its tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction with
 its tip obscured due to overlying EKG leads.  The patient is rotated to her
 left, which limits evaluation.  The right lung appears clear.  There is left
 basal opacity which obscures the left hemidiaphragm, which could represent a
 combination of aspiration/pneumonia and effusion.  The left upper lung appears
 reasonably aerated.  The left-sided rib fractures are again noted.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 The ET and NG tubes have been removed.  Overall, since the prior exam, there
 has been little change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post removal of the ET and NG tubes with persistent left
 mid and lower lung opacity concerning for consolidation and effusion.
