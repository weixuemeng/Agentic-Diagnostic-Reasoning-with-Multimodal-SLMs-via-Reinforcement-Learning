                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with rib fractures of rib 6 to ___ on
 left and rib fractures 5 through 8 on right, small left-sided pneumothorax,
 re-evaluate rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  The previously described
 left-sided pleural effusion obliterating the diaphragmatic contours and
 extending along the left lateral chest wall persists.  No new pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities are identified and no remaining pneumothorax can be
 seen in the apical area.  Similar as shown on previous chest examinations,
 there are multiple rib fractures seen in the circumference of the lateral
 chest wall.  They begin with the fifth rib and extend at least to the tenth
 rib where a slightly displaced fracture is identified in the periphery.  These
 fractures with mild displacement have not undergone any significant interval
 change in position as can be identified on this routine frontal chest view. 
 No significant callus formation can be identified.  The clinically diagnosed
 right-sided rib fractures are difficult to identify on the present standard
 frontal view.  If documentation is needed, dedicated rib films with local
 markers would be needed.  Review of multiple preceding portable chest
 examinations during the month of ___ did not reveal any injury.  Review of
 the transferred torso chest CT of ___ illustrated the multiple
 left-sided rib fractures, but conclusive evidence of right-sided rib fracture
 could not be established.
