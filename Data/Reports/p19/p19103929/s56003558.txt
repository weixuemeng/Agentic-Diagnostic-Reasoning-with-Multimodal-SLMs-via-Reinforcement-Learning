                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with increased secretions and worsening
 respiratory function.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased retrocardiac density and subtle increased
 opacity of the right lower lung.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected.  Evidence of emphysema corresponds with recent
 chest CT findings.  Cardiomegaly persists.  Calcified tortuous aorta is again
 noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasilar opacities, which likely reflect aspiration;
 atelectasis and early infection are also possibilities.
