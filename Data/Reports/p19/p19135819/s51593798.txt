                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___ at 18:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic and mitral valve repair. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Right internal jugular central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.  Mediastinal contours are similar. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is not substantially changed.  More focal opacities
 within the lung bases, particularly within the right lung base, may reflect
 areas of superimposed infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on
 the right, are not substantially changed.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Degenerative spurring is noted within the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, not substantially changed in the interval, with
 small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.  More focal bibasilar
 airspace opacities, more so within the right lung base, concerning for
 superimposed infection.
