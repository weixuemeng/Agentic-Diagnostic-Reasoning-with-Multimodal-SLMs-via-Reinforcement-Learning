                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 endotracheal tube is low in position, terminating approximately 1 cm above the
 level of the carina and should be withdrawn by at least 2 cm.  The
 endotracheal tube balloon appears overinflated.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the level of the diaphragm, extending to the expected position
 of the stomach.  There are right greater than left pulmonary opacities.  There
 may be a small left pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Prominence of the central vasculature
 suggests a component of pulmonary edema.  Lucency projecting over the left
 lower hemithorax is seen to represent a likely loculated pneumothorax vs less
 likely bulla on subsequent chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low-lying endotracheal tube terminates just above the carina.  Recommend
 withdrawal by approximately 3 cm.  Above findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ at approximately 8:20 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
 2.  Lucency projecting over the left lower hemithorax represents likely
 loculated pneumothorax, less likely bulla on subsequent chest CT.
 3.  Bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to aspiration and edema, although
 underlying contusion cannot be excluded.
