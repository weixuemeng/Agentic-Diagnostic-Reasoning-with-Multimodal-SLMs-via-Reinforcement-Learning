 HISTORY:  Status post CABG and mitral valve replacement.  Evaluate for
 worsening edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternotomy wires and
 mitral valve replacement.  The right subclavian catheter is again seen with
 the tip in the right atrium, and the left jugular catheter tip is in the mid
 to lower SVC.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including mild
 pulmonary edema, a likely small left pleural effusion, and left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged chest radiograph demonstrating mild pulmonary edema, a likely small
 left pleural effusion, and left lower lobe atelectasis.
