                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation.  The atelectasis at the left and right lung bases have
 slightly improved.  However, there are persisting mild opacities, likely
 reflecting resolving atelectatic changes.  In unchanged manner, minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus could reflect a small left pleural
 effusion.  No new focal parenchymal opacities have appeared.
