  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid right
  atrium and should be pulled back 4-5 cm.  The endotracheal tube terminates
  about 2.5 cm cranial to the carina and should be pulled back roughly 2 cm. 
  Lung volumes remain extremely low with interval increase in volume of
  posteriorly layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Discussed over the
  telephone with Dr. ___ at 20:05.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and post-operative mediastinal widening is
 grossly unchanged.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium, should be
 withdrawn for a more standard position.  ET tube is in standard position. 
 Mitral ring is noted.  There has been interval increase in mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, small to
 moderate on the left, have minimally increased.  Bibasilar atelectases have
 worsened, more so on the right.  There is no evident pneumothorax.
