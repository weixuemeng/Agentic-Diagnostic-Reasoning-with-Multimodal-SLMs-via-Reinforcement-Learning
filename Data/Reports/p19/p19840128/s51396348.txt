 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:36 PM
  Decreased small left pleural effusion compared to ___. Increased
  retrocardiac density with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, which may
  represent atelectasis or consolidation. Right paratracheal opacity is small
  and non-specific; this could represent atelectasis, but attention on follow-up
  is recommended. This study is not sensitive for acute rib pathology. If there
  is high clinical suspicion, dedicated rib series or CT is recommended.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:35 p.m. on ___ at time of
  initial review.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with left-sided rib pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fractures or new consolidation of the left lower lobe.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is cardiomegaly.  There is a left retrocadiac opacity.  There
 is a left-sided pleural effusion which appears relatively stable.  There is
 some coarsening of bronchovascular markings without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Study is of limited sensitivity for evaluation of rib fractures; however, no
 definite rib fractures are seen.  There is some demineralization.  If there is
 high concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series could be performed.
