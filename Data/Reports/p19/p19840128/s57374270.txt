                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right back pain, shortness of breath, and
 recent diagnosis of tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Read in conjunction with CT performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval increase in
 bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema. Multiple new nodules are not well appreciated on plain radiograph.  The
 patient's known lymphadenopathy is better appreciated on chest CT.  Surgical
 clips are seen adjacent to the trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema. Refer to chest CT
 performed subsequently for further information.
