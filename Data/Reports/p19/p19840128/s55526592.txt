                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mediastinal TB and new left-sided
 thoracic chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:46.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 15:15 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  There
 has been interval resolution of the interstitial edema.  A patchy opacity at
 the right lung base most likely represents patchy atelectasis, although an
 early pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.  The heart remains enlarged. 
 Surgical clips are seen in the right paratracheal region.  Calcification of
 the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis.  Degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic spine with no vertebral compression fractures.  No
 displaced rib fracture is identified.  However, if this remains of clinical
 concern, a dedicated rib series may be helpful.  No pneumothorax.
