 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with left retrocardiac opacity, evaluation if worsened or
 better.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Left lower lobe opacity which is mostly
 atelectasis and small pleural effusion is unchanged.  A superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiac contour
 enlargement is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema has completely resolved.
 
 2.  Most of the stable left lower lobe consolidation is due to atelectasis and
 small pleural effusion.  A superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
