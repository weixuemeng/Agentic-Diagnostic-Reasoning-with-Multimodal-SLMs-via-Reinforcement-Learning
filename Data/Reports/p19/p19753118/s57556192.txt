                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with  left chest pain  //? pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT of the chest from ___ as well as chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires,
 prosthetic cardiac valve and mediastinal clips are again noted. A retrocardiac
 opacity is compatible with known hiatal hernia. Faint linear density in the
 left lower lung is likely atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hiatal hernia, otherwise unremarkable.
