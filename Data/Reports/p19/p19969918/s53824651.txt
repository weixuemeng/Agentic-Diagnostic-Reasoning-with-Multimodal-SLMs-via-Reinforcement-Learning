                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with MS, now status post aspiration
 pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Tracheostomy as before.  Unchanged
 position of right-sided PICC line.  The previously described bilateral basal
 densities persist and may even have increased.  Diffuse haze over the bases
 suggests pleural effusions that probably are layering mostly in the posterior
 compartments as the patient is in semi-erect position only.  No pneumothorax
 has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent and somewhat increased bilateral parenchymal
 densities.
