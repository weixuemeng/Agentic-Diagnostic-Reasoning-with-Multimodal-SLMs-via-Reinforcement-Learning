                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with aortic stenosis and
 ventricular tachycardia   after cardiac arrest and now after dual-chamber ICD
 placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval resolution of right apical
 pneumothorax.  There is still presence of pneumopericardium noted, small.
 Previously seen   pneumomediastinum  and subcutaneous air have resolved.
 
 The left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and most likely represents area of
 atelectasis.  No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
