                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICD placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the pacer leads are
 essentially unchanged and extend to the right atrium and apex of the right
 ventricle.  The mediastinal gas and air in the pericardium are progressively
 decreasing.  On the lateral view, there is blunting of what appears to be the
 left costophrenic angle, consistent with pleural scarring or effusion.  No
 evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
