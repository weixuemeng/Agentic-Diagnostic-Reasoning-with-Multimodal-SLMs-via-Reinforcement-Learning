 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged
 but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild
 calcification of the aortic knob.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Streaky linear opacities are seen within both lung bases, likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky and linear bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
