                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unresponsive.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, there are new moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Additionally, there is haziness at the right base, which could be
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Alternatively, it could be compressive atelectasis
 related to the effusions.  The interstitial markings are increased, likely due
 to mild edema and lower lung volumes.  Atherosclerosis of the aortic arch is
 unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  More focal hazy opacification of the right base may be aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 3.  Mildly increased interstitial markings consistent with mild edema.
 
 Results were discussed with the emergency room attending at 9:15 a.m. on
 ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
