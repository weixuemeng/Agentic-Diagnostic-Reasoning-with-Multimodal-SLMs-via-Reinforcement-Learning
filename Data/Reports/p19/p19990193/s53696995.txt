                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  Since the
 prior exam, a small right pleural effusion has developed.  There is possibly a
 tiny left pleural effusion, too.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The heart is mildly enlarged and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small right and possibly tiny left pleural effusions.  No
 focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
