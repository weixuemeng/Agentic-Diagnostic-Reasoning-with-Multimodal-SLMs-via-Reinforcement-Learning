                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with a mildly tortuous aorta.  Hilar contours
 are normal.  Stable blunting of the costophrenic angles is unchanged in
 appearance since at least ___, and given this chronicity, this is likely due
 to pleural thickening rather than what was previously called pleural effusion.
 Significant, confluent areas of pleural thickening are present bilaterally,
 not significantly changed since ___.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant, confluent areas of bilateral pleural thickening. 
 What was previously called pleural effusion is likely significant pleural
 thickening given the long chronicity and identical appearance.
