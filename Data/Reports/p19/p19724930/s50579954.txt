                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___
 and dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable blunting of the costophrenic angles which is
 unchanged since at least ___ and compatible with pleural thickening.  Other
 bilateral areas of pleural thickening are reidentified.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Heart size appears increased compared to prior study. Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild interval increase in heart size may represent incipient heart
 failure.
 2.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Areas of bilateral pleural
 thickening are unchanged from prior.
