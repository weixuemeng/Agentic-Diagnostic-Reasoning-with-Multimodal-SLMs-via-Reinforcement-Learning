                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Influenza-like illness and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The chest is
 relatively underpenetrated due to the patient's body habitus.  Given this, no
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable given AP technique.  The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
 acute rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underpenetrated due to the patient's body habitus.  Given this,
 no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Non-optimal evaluation of the
 ribs.
