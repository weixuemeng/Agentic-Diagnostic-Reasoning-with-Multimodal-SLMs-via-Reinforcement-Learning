                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with asthma exacerbation and fever, evaluate
 for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show a right middle lobe opacity.  The cardiac
 silhouette appears mildly enlarged, likely accentuated due to low lung
 volumes.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  An anterior cervical fusion
 device is noted to the cervical spine, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New right middle lobe opacity could be related to atelectasis in the setting
 of lower low lung volumes or pneumonia. A repeat radiograph with a better
 inspiratory effort could be obtained if clinically necessary.
