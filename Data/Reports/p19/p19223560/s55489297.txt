 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pericardial effusion after pericardial window

 Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is somewhat smaller.  Left basal
 pleural tube is new and small left pleural effusion has decreased.  Tiny left
 apical pneumothorax is new.  Mild edema is probably present in the right lung
 exaggerated by lower lung volume.  Configuration of the right lung base
 suggests new moderate right pleural effusion at the base of the lung. 
 Moderate left infrahilar atelectasis changed in distribution but not in
 overall severity.
