                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:30 A.M. ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath on exertion in the
 setting of new pericardial effusions.  Lungs clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette is certainly consistent with pericardial
 effusion, or cardiomyopathy.  Of note, mediastinal veins are not distended,
 even though such engorgement is usually an accompaniment of cardiac tamponade.
 Bibasilar atelectasis is mild and small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present, left greater than right.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild scoliosis
 is an incidental finding.
