                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear without confluent
 consolidation.  There is no overt pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  Mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is of uncertain etiology.  A densely
 calcified aorta is noted.  The patient is status post CABG.  Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact.  The deformity of the anterior chest wall is likely due
 to prior sternal fracture.  Exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic spine is most
 severe near the thoracolumbar junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No consolidation, edema, or pleural effusion
