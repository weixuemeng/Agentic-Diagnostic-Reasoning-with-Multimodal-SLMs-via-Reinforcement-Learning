                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pneumothoraces are similar to the prior study, with
 bilateral chest tubes remaining in place.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  Left perihilar and basilar opacification are new, and
 could potentially represent an acute aspiration event and less likely
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Right lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear
 except for a few scattered calcified granulomas.  Unchanged widening of
 mediastinum in keeping with a history of aortic pseudoaneurysm, with aortic
 stent graft in place within the region of the ascending aorta.  Interval
 removal of malpositioned left PICC since the prior radiograph.
