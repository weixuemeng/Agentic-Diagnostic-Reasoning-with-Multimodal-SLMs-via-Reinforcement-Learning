                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tube to waterseal, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 252.
 
 A portable AP upright chest ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left chest tube remains in place, and there has been interval appearance of a
 small left apicolateral pneumothorax.  Left internal jugular central line has
 its tip in the proximal SVC.  There has been interval placement of a left
 subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the proximal right atrium.  Pullback
 of approximately 3-4cm to position the tip in the distal SVC would be advised.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged in this patient status
 post median sternotomy with an aortic graft and CABG and valve replacement. 
 The right apical pneumothorax is no longer evident.  There has been interval
 appearance of a patchy opacity at the right medial lung base which would be
 concerning for atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Persistent streaky opacities at the left base persist and likely
 reflect atelectasis or scarring.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Results
 were communicated directly to the patient's nurse ___ on ___ at 9:08
 a.m. at the time of discovery.
