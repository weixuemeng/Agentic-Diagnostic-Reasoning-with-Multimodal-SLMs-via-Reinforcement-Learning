                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left mainstem collapse, status post stent placement in the
 airways.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an unchanged
 status post aortic repair.  Bilateral chest tubes are seen.  The current image
 shows an unchanged right pneumothorax and an unchanged left pneumothorax.  An
 airway stent is visible, but has, so far, not contributed to a substantial
 expansion of the collapsed left lung.  There is unchanged evidence of
 mediastinal shift towards the left.
