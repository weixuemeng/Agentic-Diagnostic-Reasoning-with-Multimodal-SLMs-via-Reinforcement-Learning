 INDICATION:  Patient with new oxygen requirement.  Pneumonia, atelectasis?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has increased.  Left lower lung collapse is
 unchanged.  Right lower lung new opacity could be compatible with dependent
 edema.  Superimposed infection or aspiration could not be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Sternotomy was done for AVR.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Right-sided PICC line
 ends in cavoatrial junction.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 have increased.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has increased.
 
 2.  Right lower lung increased opacity could be compatible with dependent
 edema.  Aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in appropriate clinical
 settings.
