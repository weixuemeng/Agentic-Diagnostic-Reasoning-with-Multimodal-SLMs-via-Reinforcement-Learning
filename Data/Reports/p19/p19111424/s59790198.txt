                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent stenting of thoracic aortic aneurysm,
 now with hypoxia.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent,
 although stable, widening of the mediastinum.  There is a small left-sided
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis which is unchanged from the prior
 study.  Right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Enteric feeding tube
 is seen coiled in the stomach.  Left-sided internal jugular central venous
 line ends at the upper SVC.  The ET tube is above the upper margin of the
 clavicles, measuring 6 cm from the carina. Bilateral thoracostomy tubes are in
 unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable-appearing wide mediastinum.
 
 2.  Small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, unchanged
 from the prior study.
 
 3.  Endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, measuring 6
 cm from the carina, and should be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating.
