                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are multiple bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities worrisome for multifocal
 pneumonia.  Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a
 trace right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable and the
 aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities, most prominently in the
 mid-to-lower lung zones, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.  A component of
 superimposed pulmonary edema may be present.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
