                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple medical comorbidities p/w cecal
 volvulus, s/p R hemicolectomy  // Patient desatted, assess for COPD
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside radiograph from ___ from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning. Allowing for this, there is probable background COPD.
 Chain sutures noted in the right upper zone. There is mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film. Aorta is unfolded. Right paratracheal
 soft tissues likely represent vascular structures in someone of this age.
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring. There is
 hazy opacity at both lung bases, likely representing small layering effusions,
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Note is made of a slightly
 irregular contour of the trachea.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Background COPD. Cardiomegaly.
 2. Diffuse vascular plethora vascular blurring and small effusions. This
 likely represents CHF. The differential diagnosis could include infectious or
 inflammatory processes in the appropriate clinical setting. This appearance
 appears significantly more pronounced compared with the outside film from ___. Underlying collapse and/or consolidation present.
 3. Slightly patulous appearance to the trachea, similar to the prior film.
 Clinical correlation requested.
