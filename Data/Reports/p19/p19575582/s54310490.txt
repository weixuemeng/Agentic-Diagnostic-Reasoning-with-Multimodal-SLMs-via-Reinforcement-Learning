                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent months of cough, no sputum, no fever.
 Lungs clear. never a smoker.  // r/o lung disease
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases could represent atelectasis. 
 However, on the lateral view, there is patchy opacity projecting over the
 posterior segment of 1 of the lower lobes , which could represent a focal
 infiltrate.  The upper and mid zones of both lungs are clear, without focal
 infiltrate.  No CHF or effusion identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable, with mild unfolding of the aorta, but no frank cardiomegaly.
 
 Subtle, small concavity along the right border of the trachea at the level of
 the clavicular head is probably unchanged compared with ___ and ___.  The patient has a known multi nodular goiter and this may be related to
 that.  On today's exam, there is suggestion of some increased soft tissue
 density in this area.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible infiltrate in the posterior segment of one of the lower lobes. 
 This is new compared with ___ and probably also ___.
 2. Mild concavity of the right border of the trachea, not significantly
 changed compared with ___, may reflect mass effect from a known
 multinodular goiter.  However, on today's exam, there is also suggestion of
 some soft tissue density in this area.  Correlation with physical exam and, if
 indicated, repeat thyroid ultrasound is recommended.  Alternatively, this area
 could be assessed by chest CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Mild concavity of the right border of the trachea, not
 significantly changed compared with ___, may reflect mass effect from a
 known multinodular goiter.  However, on today's exam, there is also suggestion
 of some soft tissue density in this area.  Correlation with physical exam and,
 if indicated, repeat thyroid ultrasound is recommended.  Alternatively, this
 area could be assessed by chest CT (which would also allow for assessment of
 parenchymal infiltrates).
