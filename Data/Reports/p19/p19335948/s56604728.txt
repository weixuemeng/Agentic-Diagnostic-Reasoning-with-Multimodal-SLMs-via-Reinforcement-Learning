 subdural hematoma and status epilepticus. Intubated, low grade temperature. 
 // evaluate for consolidation     evaluate for consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at
 the right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.  Although some of this
 could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis. In the appropriate
 clinical setting this superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia
 certainly could be considered.
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged and there again are
 diffuse sclerotic metastases.
