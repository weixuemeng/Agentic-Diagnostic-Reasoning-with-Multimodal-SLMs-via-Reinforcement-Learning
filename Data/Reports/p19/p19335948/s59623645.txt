                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ?first time seizure pls eval head for intracran
 bleed/mass and cxr for pna  // History: ___M with ?first time seizure pls eval
 head for intracran bleed/mass and cxr for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The osseous structures appear heterogeneously sclerotic. Correlate with
 metastatic disease, including prostate malignancy. There are low lung volumes.
 The diaphragms are somewhat obscured which may be due to underlying
 atelectasis although small pleural effusions not excluded. Subtle left basilar
 opacity which could relate to consolidation from infection or aspiration. The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  There is central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. Dedicated PA and
 lateral views would be helpful for better evaluation when patient able.
