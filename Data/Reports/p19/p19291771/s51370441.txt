 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ex lap, appendectomy  // eval ETT placement  
 eval ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard placement. Right internal jugular line ends
 in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 Interval increase in mediastinal caliber presumably reflects increased
 intravascular volume, responsible for progressive moderate cardiomegaly as
 well. There is however no pulmonary edema. Moderate bibasilar infra hilar
 consolidation has worsened, usually due to postoperative atelectasis.
