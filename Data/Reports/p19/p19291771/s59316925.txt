  Compared with the chest radiograph from an hour a half prior, the left lower
  lung in particular appears more opacified, and the heart appears larger.  This

  did receive some IV fluids.  Differential for this change includes pulmonary
  vascular congestion, developing underlying pneumonia given history of fever,
  or aspiration.  No pneumothoraces identified.  The right lung remains grossly
  clear, except for mild basilar atelectasis.
