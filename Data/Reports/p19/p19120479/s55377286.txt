                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and CTA of the chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A recently placed pacemaker remains in place with no pneumothorax.
 One of the leads terminates anteriorly within the right ventricle, and a
 second lead courses posteriorly in the expected location of the coronary
 sinus. Although its position is not typical for this location on the frontal
 view, correlation with prior CT shows altered position of cardiac chambers due
 to rotation and shift of the heart which may influence this appearance.  The
 posterior course of the atrial lead with possible location in the coronary
 sinus was communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___, at 12:30
 p.m. at the time of discovery.
 Lungs are grossly clear except for minimal pleural and parenchymal scarring in
 the left lung base.  A questionable nodule at the level of the left third
 anterior rib on the prior CXR is no longer visualized.
