                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and CTA chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post placement of permanent pacemarker with both pacing
 leads terminate to the left of midline, with the more distal lead in the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  The prior CTA of the chest
 demonstrates baseline rotation and shift of the heart towards the left,
 causing the right atrium to project slightly to the left of midline, likely
 accounting for the location of the proximal lead on today's chest radiograph.
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and the left hemidiaphragm is chronically
 mildly elevated.  Blunting of left costophrenic sulcus appears to be due to a
 combination of cardiac enlargement and pericardial fat in this region as based
 on prior CTA of the chest.
   
 Exam is otherwise remarkable for 1.2 cm diameter opacity overlying the left
 third anterior rib level.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pacing leads probably terminate in right atrium and right ventricle based
 on correlation with chest CTA of ___, but confirmatory lateral
 radiograph would be helpful in this regard when the patient's condition
 allows.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  1.2 cm diameter opacity at left third rib level, possibly a healed rib
 fracture, but attention to this finding on a followup PA and lateral
 radiograph would be helpful to exclude a discrete lung nodule. 
 
 Dr. ___ has been notified of this finding by telephone at 8:30 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
