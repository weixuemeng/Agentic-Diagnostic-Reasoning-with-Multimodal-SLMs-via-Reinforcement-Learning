 HISTORY:  Neutropenia, MDS, now with hypotension.  Rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is no CHF, focal
 infiltrate, or gross effusion.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 is noted, possibly slightly worse than earlier the same day.  Again seen is
 dense biapical pleural thickening.
