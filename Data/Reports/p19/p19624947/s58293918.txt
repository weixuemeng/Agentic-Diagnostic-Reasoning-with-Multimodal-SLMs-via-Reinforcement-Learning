                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  In the
 interval since the prior study, there has been development of a right
 mid-to-lower lung lateral opacity likely involving the lateral segment of the
 right middle lobe, worrisome for consolidation/infection.  There is also mild
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left,
 concerning for small pleural effusions.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
 is also noted.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  Thoracic scoliosis is incidentally noted but not well
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of lateral right middle lobe opacity worrisome for
 consolidation and pneumonia.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
