                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute shortness of breath after PRBC.  Assess for TRALI.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There are lower lung volumes.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis have increased.  Mild
 interstitial edema is new.  Right middle lobe consolidation has increased. 
 Sternal wires are aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known right middle lobe pneumonia.  Ill defined opacity in the
 right upper lobe is most likely a second focus of pneumonia.
 
 New pleural effusions and mild interstitial edema could represent TRALI.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 4 p.m.
