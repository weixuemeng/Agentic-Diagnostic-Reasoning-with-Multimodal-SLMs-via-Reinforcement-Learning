                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Several weeks of cough and admission for pneumonia at an outside
 hospital.  Lung nodules reported on the previous radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  As a consequence,
 areas of atelectasis are seen at the right lung bases, better appreciated on
 the lateral than on the frontal film.  No air bronchograms are present. 
 However, the atelectatic areas could also include some component of infection.
 
 Lung nodules are not visible on the current chest radiograph.
 
 The lung parenchyma is otherwise normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
 
 If clinical symptoms persist, the right lung base should be further evaluated
 by CT.
