                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat limited due to the apical lordotic view. 
 There is a vague opacity in the right lung base which obscures the right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vascular markings appear normal.  Incidental note
 is made of an old left clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild atelectasis at the right lung base, though
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.  A more optimized
 PA and lateral chest radiograph may be useful to further characterize this
 finding.
