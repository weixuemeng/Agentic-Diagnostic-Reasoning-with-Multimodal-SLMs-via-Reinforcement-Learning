                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Hilar contours
 are prominent suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial enlargement. 
 Relative paucity of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices indicates
 underlying emphysema.  Streaky and patchy opacities are seen within the right
 mid lung field of both lung bases, potentially areas of atelectasis and/or
 infection.  No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected on this
 supine exam.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are noted, potentially related
 to recent resuscitation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema and probable underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Patchy
 opacities within the right mid lung and both lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis and/or infection.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures which may be
 related to recent resuscitation, without large pneumothorax identified.
