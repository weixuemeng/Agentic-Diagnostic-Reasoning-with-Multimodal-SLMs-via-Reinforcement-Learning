                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath now intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube has been placed in the interval, terminating
 approximately 8.5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the left
 hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and tip located off the inferior borders of
 the film.  Heart size remains within normal limits.  Mediastinal contours
 unchanged.  Bilateral hilar enlargement compatible with underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension is re- demonstrated.  Emphysema is again noted along
 with patchy airspace opacities within the right mid lung field and both lung
 bases, unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  Bilateral
 rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip is slightly high, terminating 8 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube in standard position.
 2. Unchanged right mid and bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, findings which
 may reflect atelectasis and/or infection.  No pneumothorax.
