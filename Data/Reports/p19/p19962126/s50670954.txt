  1. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.6 cm above the carina. Recommend advancement
  of both the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
  2. Moderate to severe emphysema.
  3. Ill-defined opacities in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, of
  unclear clinical significance. Close interval follow-up is recommended, with
  consideration for a repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph if appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.6 cm above the carina, and advancement is
 recommended.  Tip of the enteric tube extends to the proximal fundus of the
 body, but the sidehole is at the GE junction, and advancement is also
 recommended.  Lungs are hyperinflated, with moderate to severe emphysema. No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Ill-defined opacities are noted in
 the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, which are of unclear clinical
 significance.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal. 
 There are multiple old bilateral rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.6 cm above the carina.  Recommend
 advancement of both the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Moderate to severe emphysema.
 3. Ill-defined opacities in the right upper and left lower lung, of unclear
 clinical significance.  Close interval follow-up is recommended, with
 consideration for a repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph if appropriate.
