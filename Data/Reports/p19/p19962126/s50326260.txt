                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of COPD, with shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is relative narrowing of the transverse dimension of trachea as seen on
 prior CT, and compatible with COPD. Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with
 known diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is biapical
 scarring. Right mid lung opacity is likely related to scarring as seen on
 prior chest CT and is not definitely changed given difference in techniques.
 There is no new focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Previously described 0.9 cm nodular opacity in the left lung is not clearly
 visualized on today's examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
