 malignancy must be considered.  Elsewhere, the left lung appears clear.  There
 is no effusion. Calcified pleural plaque is present in the right mid zone. 
 The right lung appears clear.
 
 Some tracheal displacement to the right is present at the thoracic inlet
 probably due to thyroid, but lymph nodes should also be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung mass.  CT should be performed.
