                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy with pancytopenia, diffuse crackles, bilateral lower
 extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains unfolded.  There is
 perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with moderate
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Additionally, more focal opacity within the
 right upper lung field, likely within the posterior aspect of the right upper
 lobe, is concerning for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  Known left upper and lower lobe mass is unchanged resulting in
 prominence of the left hilar region.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Lungs
 remain hyperinflated compatible with underlying emphysema.  Calcified pleural
 plaques are again demonstrated bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Focal opacification in the right upper lung field is concerning for pneumonia.
 Unchanged mass in the left upper and lower lobes.
