  Increased opacification in the medial right lung base could represent an early
  developing pneumonia.  Unchanged calcified pleural plaques.  Rounded mass
  projecting at the left suprahilar region is compatible with known small cell
  carcinoma.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, on chemotherapy, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.  CT chest with contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is increased
 opacification in the medial right lung base which may represent an early
 developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context but could also
 represent atelectasis.  A large left juxtahilar mass is unchanged,
 corresponding to the patient's biopsy-proven small cell carcinoma, better
 characterized on recent CT of the chest.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques
 are present.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size but stable.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The trachea is
 midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly increased opacification at the medial right lung base could
 represent an early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context
 or, alternatively, atelectasis.
 2.  Left juxtahilar mass corresponding to known small cell carcinoma, better
 characterized on recent CT of ___.
 3.  Calcified pleural plaques compatible with prior asbestos exposure.
