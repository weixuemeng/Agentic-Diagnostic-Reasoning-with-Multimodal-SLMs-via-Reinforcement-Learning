                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post right-sided VATS bullectomy for
 recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the pigtail pleural catheter has been removed
 and replaced with two right-sided chest tubes.  There is a moderate-sized
 apical pneumothorax on the right, measuring 7.2 cm from the top of the
 thoracic cage to the top of the collapsed right upper lobe.  Right chest wall
 emphysema has progressed.  There is no mediastinal shift or hemidiaphragmatic
 flattening to suggest tension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in right apical pneumothorax with two chest tubes in
 place and no evidence of tension.
