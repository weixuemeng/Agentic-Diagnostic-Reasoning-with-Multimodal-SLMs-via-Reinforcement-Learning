                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post lobectomy, now status post
 chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day at 12:31.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of right apical chest tube with no
 large pneumothorax identified.  Lucent foci are noted over the right apex, and
 are likely representative of foci of subcutaneous air versus a small
 pneumothorax.  Otherwise, subcutaneous air in the right axilla appears
 unchanged.
 
 Stable right basilar pleural thickening is noted along with right
 paramediastinal opacity, consistent with post-surgical changes. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of right apical chest tube with no evidence of a large
 pneumothorax.  Lucent foci are noted over the right apex and are likely
 representative of subcutaneous foci of gas versus a small pnemothorax.
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ via
