                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobectomy, pleurodesis, elevated WBCs.  Assess for
 interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs dating ___ to ___ as well as CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Persistent moderate-to-large right apical pneumothorax and right chest wall
 subcutaneous gas are without significant change since ___.  
 Right-sided chest tube side holes are positioned in the pneumothorax; however,
 the tip terminates within the soft tissues of the thoracic inlet.  
 
 Stable right basilar pleural thickening containing multiple small locules of
 air is consistent with provided history of pleurodesis.  Right lower lung
 opacification is unchanged compared to ___, and given airway secretions
 evident on ___ CT, this likely represents aspiration. Right upper
 paramediastinal opacity is consistent with recent blebectomy. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Stable moderate to large right apical pneumothorax with unchanged extensive
 subcutaneous gas due to persitent air leak. Bronchopleural fistula??? and/or
 chest tube malfunction???.  Chest tube holes are contained within pneumothorax
 but tip terminates within the soft tissues of the thoracic inlet.  
 2. Right lower lobe opacification, likely due to aspiration
