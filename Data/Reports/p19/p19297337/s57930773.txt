                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right VATS, right upper lobe bullectomy and
 pleurodesis.  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and midline.  Right apical and basal
 chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Moderate right pneumothorax is grossly
 unchanged.  Opacity due to postoperative changes in the right apex has
 markedly improved.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Apical bullous
 emphysema on the left is unchanged.  Previously present opacity in the left
 mid lung is no longer visualized.  There has been interval decrease in right
 subcutaneous emphysema.
