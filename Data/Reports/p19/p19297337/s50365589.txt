                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post right upper lobe bullectomy
 and pleurodesis, now with right upper lobe pneumonia and air leak.  Study
 requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are three right chest tubes in place and in unchanged
 position, two of which terminate in the apex. The large, persistent, right
 apical pleural space, measuring 9.0 cm from the top of the thoracic cage to
 the collapsed right upper lobe, is unchanged. There is no mediastinal shift or
 hemidiaphragmatic flattening to suggest tension. Increased area of density in
 the collapsed right upper lobe is likely hematoma from recent surgery. The
 extent of soft tissue air collection in the right chest wall has not changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent large right apical pleural space with no evidence of
 tension. Stable right lung hematoma and atelectasis.
