                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lung resection one month ago,
 evaluate lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size and mediastinal structures
 unchanged.  The previously identified basal pleural densities that obliterate
 the right-sided lateral pleural sinus has further regressed; some pleural
 thickening remains.  Previously still identifiable contours of the chest tube
 tract have now resolved completely.  Apically located air bubbles in the
 pleural space have also resolved and an apparent pleural scar cap has
 developed without evidence of any active pulmonary or pleural abnormalities. 
 Overall appearance of rather advanced emphysematous pulmonary changes persist.
 No evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates or vascular abnormalities.  The
 previously remaining small amounts of air pockets in the right axillary area
 have now resolved completely.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of scar formations, but no evidence of new pulmonary
 or pleural abnormality.  General impression of advanced emphysema persists.
