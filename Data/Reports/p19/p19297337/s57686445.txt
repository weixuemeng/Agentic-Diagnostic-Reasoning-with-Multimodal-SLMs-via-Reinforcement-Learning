                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-surgery with persistent air leak, now with apical chest tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is
 essentially no change despite the multiple right chest tubes.  Large apical
 pleural space is again seen at the top of the collapse right upper lobe.  No
 change in appearance of the midline structures or in the extensive
 subcutaneous gas on the right.
