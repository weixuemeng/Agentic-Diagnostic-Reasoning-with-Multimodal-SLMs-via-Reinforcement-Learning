                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right VATS blebectomy on the right as well as
 mechanical pleurodesis status post chest tube removal for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, with the most recent chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right apical chest tube appears unchanged.  Previously noted
 substantial right pneumothorax has significantly decreased. Lucent foci are
 still noted at the right lung apex and may be representative of pneumothorax
 versus subcutaneous foci of air. Right axillary subcutaneous foci of air are
 also decreased. 
 
 Stable right basilar pleural thickening is again noted and appears relatively
 unchanged and minimally improved.  Right upper paramediastinal opacity is
 again noted and consistent with postsurgical changes.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significant decreased in previously noted right apical pneumothorax. Small
 lucent foci are again noted overlying the right apex and may be small foci of
 pneumothorax versus subcutaneous air. Chest tube appears in place with the tip
 terminating at the origin of the thoracic inlet.
 2.  Right lower lobe opacities appear minimally improved.
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ via
 telephone at 3:44 pm on ___.
