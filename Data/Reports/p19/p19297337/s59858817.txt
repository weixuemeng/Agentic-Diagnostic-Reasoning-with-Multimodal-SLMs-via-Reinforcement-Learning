                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of recent pleurodesis presents with fever to 105.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right chest tube is in similar position to the prior study.  Again seen is a
 moderate to large pneumothorax on the right, slightly decreased in size since
 the prior study.  There is extensive subcutaneous gas seen in the right
 lateral chest wall.  There is a new right pleural effusion.  Opacities are
 concerning for pneumonia.  The left lung is hyperinflated but clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Decrease of moderate to large right pneumothorax compared to the prior
 study.
 
 2. New pleural effusion and opacity at the right base, likely representing
 infection.
