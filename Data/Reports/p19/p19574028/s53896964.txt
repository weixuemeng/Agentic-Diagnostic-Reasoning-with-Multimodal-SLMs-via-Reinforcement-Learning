                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with worsening cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  Heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation but unchanged when comparison is made with previous studies. 
 No typical configurational abnormalities identified.  The aorta is of ordinary
 ___ and does not show any local contour abnormalities or walled
 calcifications.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There are no
 signs of acute or chronic pulmonary parenchymal densities.  The pleural spaces
 are free.  There is no fluid in lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  No
 pneumothorax is present in the apical area seen on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions
 which could explain patient's cough.  Heart size at upper limit of normal
 variation existed already on three previous chest examinations obtained in
 ___, ___ and ___.  There is no evidence of any abnormal pulmonary vascular
 changes so cardiac chronic failure is unlikely to be the cause of the
 patient's cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute infiltrates or pulmonary congestion in this patient with
 history of chronic cough.
