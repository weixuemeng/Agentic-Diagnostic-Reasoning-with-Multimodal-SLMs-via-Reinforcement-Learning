                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with question of progressing left upper lobe
 opacity.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is confluent,
 left greater than right, pulmonary fibrosis which is most prominent in the
 left upper lobe.  Findings have progressed since ___ with
 increased left upper lobe heterogeneous pulmonary markings.  There is new
 tenting of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting left lung volume loss. 
 Bilateral loculated pleural effusions have increased, now moderate in size
 with increased left upper lung subpleural opacity.  Heart size is stable. 
 Left PICC has been removed.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Confluent, left greater than right, pulmonary fibrosis, progressed since ___ with increased left upper lobe heterogeneous pulmonary markings.
 Findings are consistent with worsening fibrotic disease with probable
 superimposed infection or, less likely, pulmonary edema.  Increased loculated
 pleural effusion, now moderate in size, especially on the left.
