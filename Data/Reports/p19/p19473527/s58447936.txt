                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, wheezing, and rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, ___, and ___; chest CT from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is probably a small persistent pleural effusion on the left, but with
 increased superimposed opacification projecting along the posterior
 costophrenic angle.  Fissures are thickened and there is a generalized mild
 prominence of the interstitium, suggesting interstitial changes, although mild
 vascular congestion is possible.  Irregular pulmonary architecture,
 particularly in the upper lungs, is suggestive of emphysema.  Multifocal
 left-sided rib deformities appear unchanged as well as scarring at the left
 lung apex.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased left posterior basilar opacification including persistent small
 pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Mild interstitial abnormality, which may reflect emphysema and mild
 chronic interstitial disease, although mild superimposed vascular congestion
 could be considered in the appropriate setting.
