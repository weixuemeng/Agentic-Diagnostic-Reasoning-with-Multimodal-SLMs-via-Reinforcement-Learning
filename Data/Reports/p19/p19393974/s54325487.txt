                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, lung crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly which appears
 grossly unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are again
 noted.  Pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged.  Lungs appear
 hyperinflated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted without focal
 consolidation.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  There is diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures with numerous compression deformities noted in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine, many of which have developed in the interval and are of
 unclear chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Multiple compression fractures throughout the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine have developed since ___, but of unclear age.
