                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal opacity is suspected in the
 right middle lobe to explain a slightly obscured right lateral cardiac border
 on the frontal view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing evidence for pneumonia; suspected slight
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
