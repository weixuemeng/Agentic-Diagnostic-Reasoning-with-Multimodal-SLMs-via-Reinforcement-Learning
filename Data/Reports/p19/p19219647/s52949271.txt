 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is
 severe emphysema. Heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base, could be
 aspiration. At the lateral aspect of the left lung, there is an area of
 increased opacity which could relate to pleural thickening.   There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base could be aspiration.
 Increased opacity at the lateral aspect of the left lung, could relate to
 pleural thickening. Further evaluation with lateral and oblique views is
 recommended.
