                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and history of COPD, afebrile with
 elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  On the
 lateral view, there is increased density in the posterior costophrenic sulcus
 with blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles bilaterally which is new. 
 Based on the frontal view, this is likely a localizing to the right base
 medially.  This is in aregion of previously seen scarring but is suspicious
 for superimposed consolidation and possible trace effusions.  Elsewhere the
 lungs are clear.  Focal opacity at the right lung base laterally on the
 frontal view is likely due to changes in the anterior 7th rib.  Old right ___
 rib fracture is again seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right basilar opacity compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical
 setting.  Possible trace bilateral effusions.
