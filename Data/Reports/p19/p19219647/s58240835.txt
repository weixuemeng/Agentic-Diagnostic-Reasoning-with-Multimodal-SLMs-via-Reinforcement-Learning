                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD.  Evaluate for signs of infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate markedly
 hyperinflated lungs with increased AP diameter and flattening of the
 diaphragms indicating severe emphysema.  The subtle opacity seen on the prior
 radiograph has improved.  Remote healed right rib fracture is noted.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal aside from mildly tortuous aorta. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved area of opacification at the right base.  No other
 definite focal pneumonia.
