                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall last night.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Again, there is basilar scarring.  No new
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the
 aorta calcified and tortuous and the cardiac silhouette not enlarged.  There
 is an old-appearing fracture of the lateral right ninth rib, with evidence of
 callus seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
