                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxic.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms
 and relative lucency of the upper lobes, consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease with pulmonary emphysema.  There is persistent right base
 opacity similar as compared to the prior study, though slightly increased as
 compared to ___.  Findings could be due to underlying pneumonia or
 aspiration.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Old bilateral rib
 fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD with pulmonary emphysema.
 2.  Right base opacity appears slightly increased.  Findings may be due to
 progression of pneumonia; however, underlying pulmonary lesion is not
 excluded, particularly given underlying COPD.  Recommend followup to
 resolution, consider nonurgent chest CT given background of COPD.
