                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe accompanied by
 bronchial wall thickening has worsened in the interval and is likely due to an
 evolving pneumonia.  Nonspecific patchy and linear opacities at the left lung
 base are also demonstrated, and may reflect atelectasis and/or additional site
 of infection.  Small right pleural effusion is similar to the prior study. 
 Upper lobe predominant emphysema is also demonstrated.
