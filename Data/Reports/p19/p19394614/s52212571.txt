                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild improvement in pulmonary
 edema.  An area of patchy opacification in the right mid zone could reflect
 superimposed pneumonia.  There is also hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease, so that some of the interstitial changes could
 be associated with this etiology.
 
 There are intact midline sternal wires with single-channel pacemaker and
 evidence of calcification in coronary vessels.
