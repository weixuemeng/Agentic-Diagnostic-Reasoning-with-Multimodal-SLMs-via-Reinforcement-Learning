                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is mild unfolding and calcification along
 the aortic arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Projecting in
 the right infrahilar region is a nodular opacity measuring about 15 mm in
 diameter.  Although it may represent a confluence of vascular shadows or
 perhaps pneumonia in the appropriate setting, the possibility of a lung nodule
 should be considered.  The opacity is not visualized on the lateral view. 
 Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Surgical clips project along the right
 upper quadrant.  Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar opacification with nodular appearance.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, differential considerations include pneumonia,
 but a lung nodule should be considered and either a follow-up radiograph
 should be obtained in the short term after treatment if pneumonia is suspected
 or chest CT should be considered.  Comparison to prior radiographs, if
 available, could also be useful.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone while the
 patient was still in the emergency room.
