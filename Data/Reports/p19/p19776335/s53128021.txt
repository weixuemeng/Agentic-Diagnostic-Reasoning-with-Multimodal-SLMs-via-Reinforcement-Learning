                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top-normal with mildly tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  Hilar contours are normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged with stable bibasilar opacities.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable small bilateral effusions with unchanged bibasilar opacities. 
 Infection cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance. 
 Lateral views of the chest would help to distinguish the extent of parenchymal
 opacities over effusion.
