                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 Indistinct prominent pulmonary vascularity suggests mild fluid overload.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are suspected.  In
 addition, referring medial right lower lobe, and perhaps with medial left
 lower lobe opacity as well, there is a fairly confluent opacity suggestiveof
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although substantial
 atelectasis could be considered.  Fissures appear thickened.  Findings are new
 since the recent prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting vascular congestion.  Basilar opacities,
 pneumonia versus atelectasis.
