                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, smoker, vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension presents
 with three days of worsening shortness of breath and worsening productive
 cough.  Assess for pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON: Comparison is made to multiple prior radiographs most recently
 dated ___ and a ___ CT.
 
 FINDINGS: A severe new interstitial lung abnormality is found mostly in the
 left upper lobe.  There is a growing opacification in the right upper
 paramediastinal lung where a fiducial marks the focused radiation treatment of
 a non-small cell lung cancer.  Callus formation marks healed rib fractures.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New interstitial abnormality, more likely infection or drug
 reaction than cardiogenic edema. Probable local recurrence, radiated right
 upper lobe lung cancer.
