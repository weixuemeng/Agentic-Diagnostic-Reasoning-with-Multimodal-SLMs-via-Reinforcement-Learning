                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  COPD and small cell lung cancer, chest pain.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Opacity with fiducial
 seed in the right apex is again noted.  There is new atelectasis in the
 lingula.  Faint rounded opacity in the right perihilar region could be due to
 superimposition of normal structures, a lung nodule can be present.  Oblique
 views are recommended for further evaluation.
