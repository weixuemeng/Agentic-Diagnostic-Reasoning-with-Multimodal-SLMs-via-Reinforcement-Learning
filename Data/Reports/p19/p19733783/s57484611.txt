                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath status post pleurodesis, pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:20 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen are two chest tubes overlying the right lung.  No obvious
 pneumothorax is detected.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again noted.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Increased opacity in the right
 suprahilar region is probably unchanged.  Extensive increased interstitial
 markings in the right lung and atelectasis, with pleural fluid and/or
 thickening, at the right lung base and extreme right apex are unchanged. 
 Atelectasis at the left lung base, with minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is noted, not significantly changed.  No focal infiltrate
 is identified in the left lung.  No upper zone redistribution is seen on the
 left to suggest global CHF. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Allowing for differences in technique, there may be slight worsening of
 interstitial markings and right base pleural fluid.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  
 
 2) Please see report of ___ chest CT referring to known lung cancer with
 confluent right lung nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as well as
 peribronchial thickening, septal thickening, and complex pleural effusion,
 superimposed on background emphysema.
