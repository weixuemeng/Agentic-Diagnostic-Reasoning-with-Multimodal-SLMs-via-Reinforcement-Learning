                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right pneumothorax post-needle
 biopsy, check for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal and
 unchanged appearance of the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There are chronic interstitial
 abnormalities and pleural scar formations coinciding with low positioned and
 flattened diaphragms, all rather typical for COPD.  Patient has been evaluated
 for suspicious lesion in the right apical area and a transthoracic needle
 biopsy resulted in an apical pneumothorax which was followed on multiple
 examinations. Ohe last preceding of ___, the apical pneumothorax was
 minimal and on today's examination no pneumothorax can be identified anymore. 
 Instead, there is now a local pleural apical density, probably a scar
 formation.  Mild blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus persists.  There
 is no evidence of significant pleural effusion on the bases as the diaphragms
 are flattened.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complicating post-interventional pneumothorax cannot be
 identified anymore.
