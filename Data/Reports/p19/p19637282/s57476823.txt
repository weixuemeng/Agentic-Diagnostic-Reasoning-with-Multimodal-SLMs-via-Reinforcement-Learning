                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ female admitted after being found down with large L frontal
 IPH, R front-pariet scattered tSAH, biventricular hemorrhage .  // please
 evaluate interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and cervical spine CT scan dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  An enteric
 tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized.  A rounded opacity at the right
 lung apex corresponds to extensive scarring and bronchiectasis, which was
 partially imaged on the recent C-spine CT.  Left apical scarring with
 retraction of the hilum and of volume loss is unchanged.  The heart and
 mediastinum are within normal limits.  Overlying tubing contributes to
 increased opacification at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical mass-like opacity may be due to scarring from prior infection
 (e.g.  TB) or radiation fibrosis, but a dedicated chest CT is recommended to
 exclude malignancy.  No other significant interval change.  Correlation with
 clinical history for possible previous radiation is suggested.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:44 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
