                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, chills and shortness of breath, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Minimal streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection is not fully excluded. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar streaky opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded.
