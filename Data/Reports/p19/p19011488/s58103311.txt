                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles and productive cough x1 week.  Evaluate for congestive
 heart failure or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate pulmonary edema, worsening moderate cardiomegaly, and
 widening of the vascular pedicle suggests congestive heart failure
 exacerbation.  Opacity of the left lower lung is likely due to pleural
 effusion and some component of atelectasis.  However, underlying infectious
 process such as pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of apical
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Worsening cardiomegaly, bilateral pulmonary edema, and widening of the
 vascular pedicle suggest CHF exacerbation. 
 
 2.  Left lower lung opacity is likely pleural effusion with a component of
 atelectasis, however, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 ___ at 3:10 p.m. on ___, 30 minutes after discovery.
