                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 present.  Prominent left epicardial fat pad is noted, as seen on prior exams,
 though a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Bibasilar opacities
 may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Evaluation the lateral view is limited due to the patient's
 inability to raise her arms. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Prominent left epicardial
 fat pad; small left pleural effusion may be present.
