                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with evaluation for lung expansion/effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs were available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ill-defined, large opacity in the left upper-mid lung is
 concerning for pneumonia.  Larger and more dense opacity in the left lower
 lung is likely a combination of moderate effusion and atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.  Right lung is clear.  Pleural effusion if any is minimal on
 the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left upper-mid lung consolidation, in view of clinical
 history is worrisome for pneumonia.  More homogeneous and dense left lower
 lung opacity is combination of effusion and atelectasis and/or consolidation.
