                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post chest tube pull, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:21.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of one of the two left-sided chest tubes.  There
 continues to be a moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated volume
 loss of the left lung.  Overall, it appears that the left effusion may have
 slightly increased since removal of the chest tube.  Overall, cardiac contour
 is difficult to assess due to the left side being obscured by the pleural and
 possibly associated airspace process.  There is likely partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The right lung remains well inflated and is grossly clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
