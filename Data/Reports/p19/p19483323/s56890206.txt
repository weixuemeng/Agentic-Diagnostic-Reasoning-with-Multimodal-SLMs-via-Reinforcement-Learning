                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with community-acquired
 pneumonia and suspicion for tuberculosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is almost entire resolution of the left upper
 lobe consolidations with only minimal residual left.  Rest of the lungs are
 clear.  Heart size and mediastinum are normal in appearance.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Repeated examination in three to four weeks
 is recommended.
