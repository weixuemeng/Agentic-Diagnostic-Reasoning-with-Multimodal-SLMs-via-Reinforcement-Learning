                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with worsening cough and fever to 101 for six days,
 please evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Left hilus is enlarged, probably due to lymphadenopathy.  There is no volume
 loss in the upper lobe, but there is heterogeneous opacification with a
 peribronchovascular distribution and some nodulation in the anterior segment
 of the upper lobe.  This could be due to acute pneumonia, but possibility of
 primary tuberculosis should be entertained.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and
 there is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Findings were discussed
 by telephone with Dr. ___ at 4:20 p.m. on ___.
