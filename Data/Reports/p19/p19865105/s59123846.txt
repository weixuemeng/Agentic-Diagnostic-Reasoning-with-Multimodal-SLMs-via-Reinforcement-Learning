 AP CHEST 8:36 A.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with a Pleurx catheter.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Following insertion of the right basal pleural drain, previous
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has resolved, replaced by air.  There
 is more opacification in the right lower lobe, probably atelectasis.  Left
 pleural drain unchanged in position with a small residual left pleural
 effusion or thickening.  Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.  Widening of the
 upper mediastinum due to a combination of tortuous vessels, fat deposition and
 mildly enlarged thyroid gland.
