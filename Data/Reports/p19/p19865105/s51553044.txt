                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and history of pleural
 effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual lead pacemaker is
 unchanged with leads extending to the region of the right ventricle.  A thorax
 catheter is again seen at the left lung base.  Pleural effusions appear
 similar to prior exam without significant change.  Mild basilar opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No new consolidation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable with atherosclerotic calcification
 along the aortic knob.  The bony structures appear stable.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant change in small bilateral pleural effusions with left chest
 tube in place.
