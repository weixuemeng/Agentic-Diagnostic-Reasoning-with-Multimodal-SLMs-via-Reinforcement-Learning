                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 degree of right pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis. 
 There is now increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis in this
 region.  Pacer devices remain in place.  
 
 Otherwise, little change.
