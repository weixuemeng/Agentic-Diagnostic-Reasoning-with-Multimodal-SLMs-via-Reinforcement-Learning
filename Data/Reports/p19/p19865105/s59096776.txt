 HISTORY:  ___ years old man with right pleural effusion, right thoracentesis,
 evaluation of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 11:32.
 
 FINDINGS:  After thoracentesis there has been interval decrease of right base
 pleural effusion, now small.  There is also new small pneumothorax at the
 right costophrenic angle.  
 Increased opacification at the right lung base is likely related to moderate
 post-procedural edema.  The lung is otherwise clear except for linear opacity
 at the left lung base compatible with atelectasis.  
 Heart size still moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease of right base pleural effusion with mild
 reexpansion pulmonary edema and small right lung base pneumothorax.
