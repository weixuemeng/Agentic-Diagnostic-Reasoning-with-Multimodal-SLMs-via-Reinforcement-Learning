 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  PA and lateral chest x-ray ___, portable AP
 chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new RV lead placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new pacemaker lead terminating in the right ventricle as
 expected.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, but stable compared to prior. 
 There is moderate stable cardiomegaly.  There is still a moderate right
 pleural effusion with associated atelectasis which is stable compared to the
 most recent prior study.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattened
 diaphragms.  There is stable indentation upon the right aspect of the trachea
 with fullness of the superior mediastinum correlating to known goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New pacemaker lead with tip terminating in the right ventricle as
 expected.
 2.  Stable moderate right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
 3.  Lung hyperinflation with flattened hemidiaphragms.
