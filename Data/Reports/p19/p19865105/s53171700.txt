                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs were acquired.  As before, there is a
 left pacemaker with an associated right ventricular lead, not significantly
 changed in position.  There is a new moderate right pleural effusion with
 evidence of lateral loculation.  Fluid extends into the minor fissure.  There
 is associated right basilar compressive atelectasis.  Additional heterogeneous
 opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung, best seen on the PA projection, is
 concerning for an infectious process.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The heart is moderately enlarged, not significantly
 changed in size.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with fullness of the
 superior mediastinum and indentation upon the right aspect of the trachea,
 possibly due to a substernal goiter, unchanged.  Aortic calcifications are
 seen.  Bilateral carotid artery calcifications are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate, partially loculated, right pleural effusion.
 2.  Heterogeneous right basilar opacities, possibly representing compressive
 atelectasis, though pneumonia may also be present.
