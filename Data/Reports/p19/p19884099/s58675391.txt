                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath and orthopnea
 for several weeks, evaluate for CHF or other abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy and history of previous Bentall
 aortic valve procedure.  Moderate cardiac enlargement with prominence of the
 left ventricle to the left and posteriorly, but there is presently no evidence
 of marked left atrial enlargement or significant pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Surgical clips are overlying the area of the operated ascending
 aorta, but in the arch, the descending vascular contours are well delineated
 and there is no evidence of local aneurysmatic bulge.  Moderate amount of
 aortic wall calcifications are also noted.  There is minor blunting of the
 right lateral pleural sinus, but this does not extend into the posterior area.
 On the left side, no evidence of pleural thickening is present.  Nowhere in
 the lung fields can one identify any acute pulmonary infiltrates and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area as seen on the frontal view. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding available chest examination in our
 records dated ___.  This examination constituted the last
 postoperative examination at the time when the patient underwent aortic valve
 replacement in our institution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post aortic valve surgery with moderate cardiac
 enlargement and elongated thoracic aorta, but presently no evidence of
 pulmonary congestion or acute pulmonary infiltrates.  Minimal pleural scar on
 right base.  No pneumothorax.
