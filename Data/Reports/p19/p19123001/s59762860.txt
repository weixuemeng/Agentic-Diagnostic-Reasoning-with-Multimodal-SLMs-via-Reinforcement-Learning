                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pitting bilateral edema.  Question pneumonia
 or effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___ and ___.  Hazy opacities at the lung bases,
 silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm likely due to effusions and potentially
 also in part due to patient positioning.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion, mildly indistinct markings.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in configuration.  Previously identified right-sided PICC is no longer
 visualized.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable left greater than right pleural effusions and mild
 pulmonary edema.
