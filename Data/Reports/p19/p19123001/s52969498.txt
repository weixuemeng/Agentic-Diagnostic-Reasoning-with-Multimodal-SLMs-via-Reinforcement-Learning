 Right IJ catheter and PICC both terminate in the low SVC.  Endotracheal tube
 and nasogastric tube have been removed.  Right mid lung juxtahilar opacity is
 new but may reflect artifact of breast shadow.  Left basal dense retrocardiac
 atelectasis is increased.  Bilateral effusions are also likely.  Cardiac size
 is modestly enlarged as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right juxtahilar opacity is increased but may simply be
 artifactual due to breast shadow. Repeat examination with PA/Lateral views is
 recommended for further assessment.
