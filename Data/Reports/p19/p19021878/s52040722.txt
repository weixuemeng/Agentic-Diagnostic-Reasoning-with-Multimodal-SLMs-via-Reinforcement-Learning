                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // r/o chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged and the aorta is tortuous and calcified as before. Lung
 volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. There is pulmonary
 vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are most
 consistent with bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral effusions however
 underlying infection should be considered in the appropriate setting.  A right
 humeral prosthesis is demonstrated. A large hiatal hernia projects over the
 heart unchanged from the prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema. Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis and small effusions however underlying
 infection should be considered in the appropriate setting.
