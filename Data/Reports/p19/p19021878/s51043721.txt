                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F cardiogenic shock, PA catheter, possible pna.  // assess PA
 catheter placement, volume status and infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now severely rotated
 towards the right.  A direct comparison of the pulmonary artery catheter
 therefore is not reliably possible.  The size of the cardiac silhouette as
 well as the bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis
 and the signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema have not substantially
 changed.
