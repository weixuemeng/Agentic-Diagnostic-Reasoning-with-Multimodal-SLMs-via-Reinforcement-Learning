                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF and new cough and weakness  // r/o
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study the right internal jugular central venous line is been
 removed.  Heart size appears normal and a tortuous aorta is again
 demonstrated.  Opacification of the retrocardiac region is likely secondary to
 the known large hiatal hernia.  Additional right lung base opacity could be
 from consolidation and a small pleural effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Right shoulder arthroplasty appears unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lung base consolidation and costophrenic angle obscuration may
 reflect pneumonia and a small right pleural effusion.
