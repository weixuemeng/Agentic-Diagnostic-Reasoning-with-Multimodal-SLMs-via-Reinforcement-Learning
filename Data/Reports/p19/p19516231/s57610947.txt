                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.  Since the most
 recent chest radiograph on ___, which showed apical and basal
 components of left pneumothorax, the small apical component is unchanged and
 the basal component has been largely replaced by fluid, virtually comparable
 to the pre-thoracentesis volume of fluid earlier on ___.  There has
 been no change in the abnormalities in the right hemithorax consisting of
 significant thickening of the apical pleural margin, probably encompassing and
 mediastinal pleural margin as well down to the elevated right hilus,
 indicating either bronchial obstruction or more likely scarring. Retrosternal
 pleural calcification is seen on the lateral view. The margin of abnormal lung
 in the left suprahilar region is straight enough to raise the question of
 prior radiation and paramediastinal radiation fibrosis.  Knowing that history
 would be useful in interpreting the radiographic findings.  Heart size is
 normal.  Lungs are clear of any acute abnormalities.
 
 Any chest imaging before ___ should be obtained if possible to
 evaluate these findings.
