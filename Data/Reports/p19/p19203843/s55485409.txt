                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female after accidental foreign body ingestion (sewing
 pin).  Assess for position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  In the left upper quadrant between the left
 eleventh and twelfth posterior ribs is a linear hyperdensity measuring 4.5 cm
 on the frontal projection.  On the lateral view, this hyperdensity is seen
 inferior to the gastric bubble ~1.5 cm anterior to the spine.  Findings
 correspond to a foreign body within the stomach.  No subdiaphragmatic free air
 is evident.  
 
 The lungs are clear without confluent consolidation.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  4.5 cm linear hyperdense foreign body in the region of the stomach.  
 2.  No subdiaphragmatic free air, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.
 3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
