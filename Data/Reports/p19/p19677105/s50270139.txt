                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with a history of left lower lobe pneumonia in
 late ___.  Rule out residual.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph available here, ___.
 
 It is difficult to say whether I am seeing a 12 mm wide nodule to the right of
 the right heart border and lower pole of the hilus or vessel on end.  It would
 be very useful to compare this with prior chest radiographs showing the
 described pneumonia to see if this might be a residual abnormality in the
 region of previous infection.  Failing that, it would be necessary to examine
 the area with CT scanning.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is new since ___, but there is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion, edema or pleural effusion nor any evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement.
