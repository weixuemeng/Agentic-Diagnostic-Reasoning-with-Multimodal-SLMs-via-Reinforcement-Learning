                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for recurrent pericardial effusion in a patient with
 shortness of breath and recent pericardial window for cardiac tamponade.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, which may in part be due to low lung volumes.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There are bilateral small pleural effusions. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, increased in size compared to ___.  Although this could represent recurrent pericardial effusion, it may be
 related to lower lung volumes.  Echocardiography may be more helpful in the
 detection of pericardial effusion.
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
