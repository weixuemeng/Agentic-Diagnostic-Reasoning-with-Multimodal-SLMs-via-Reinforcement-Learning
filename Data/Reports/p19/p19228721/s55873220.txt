                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Worsening areas of opacification are
 demonstrated within both mid lung fields as well as within the right lung
 base, findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Multiple bilateral
 pulmonary nodules are obscured due to this new parenchymal process. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged with widening of the left superior
 mediastinal contour compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Emphysematous changes and hyperinflation of lungs are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening parenchymal opacifications within both mid lung fields and right
 lung base, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Previously seen multiple
 bilateral pulmonary nodules are obscured by this acute pulmonary process. 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
