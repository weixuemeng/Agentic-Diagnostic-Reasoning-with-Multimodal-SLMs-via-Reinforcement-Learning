                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent small bowel obstruction.  Assess for free air
 in the abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___ at 4:40
 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single upright portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  An
 NG tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, with its tip positioned in
 the mid stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  There is minimal bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Subtle lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is concerning for
 pneumoperitoneum.  Air is seen within non-dilated loops of colon.  Previously
 seen air-filled dilated loops of small bowel on the prior radiograph from
 earlier today are not identified on the present study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is concerning for pneumoperitoneum. 
 Recommend further evaluation with a left lateral decubitus radiograph.
 
 2.  Interval resolution of air-filled dilated loops of small bowel seen on
 radiographs from earlier today.
 
 3.  Minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
