                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:   Small-bowel obstruction and emesis.  Status post
 nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is an orogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are in the fundus
 of the stomach.  This could be advanced 5 to 10 cm for more optimal placement
 as the sideport is near the GE junction.  Heart size is within normal limits. 
 Lungs are grossly clear.  There is an unremarkable bowel gas pattern in the
 upper portion of the abdomen.
