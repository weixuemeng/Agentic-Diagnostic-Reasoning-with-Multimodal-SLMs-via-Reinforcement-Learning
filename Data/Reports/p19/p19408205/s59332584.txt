                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fever and cough  // r/o acute infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased opacity in the right perihilar region.  The right cardiac
 margin is not clearly identified on the frontal view.  While this may be
 partially due to rotation, given subtle increased opacity on the lateral view
 projecting over the cardiac silhouette underlying right middle lobe
 consolidation is likely present.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe opacity which could be in part due to scarring given prior
 findings although superimposed infection would certainly be possible.
