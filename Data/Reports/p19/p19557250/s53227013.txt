 The patient is status post tracheostomy with the tube projecting over the

 limits.  Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base, otherwise the lung fields
 are clear. There is no pneumothorax, fracture or dislocation.  Limited
 assessment of the abdomen is unremarkable.

 No pneumothorax.  Significant volume loss, left lower lobe, could be due to
 retained secretions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CT for evaluation of the airway if left
 lower lobe does not re-expand.
