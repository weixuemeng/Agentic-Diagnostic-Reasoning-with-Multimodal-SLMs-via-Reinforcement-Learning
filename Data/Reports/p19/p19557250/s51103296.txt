 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, and the left lower lobe is persistently opacified. 
 Since the left hilus is depressed, this is due to either substantially or
 exclusively left lower lobe atelectasis.  Pleural effusions are small if any. 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is long-standing but there is no
 pulmonary edema.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and an
 esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
