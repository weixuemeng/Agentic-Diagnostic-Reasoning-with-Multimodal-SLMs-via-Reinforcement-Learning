 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Lung volumes are decreased.
 Retrocardiac opacity could be secondary to atelectasis, however an underlying
 focal consolidation cannot be entirely excluded in this single-view. Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle could be secondary to a small amount of pleural
 fluid.  The right hemithorax remains clear with no new focal consolidation
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity which could be secondary to atelectasis,
 however an underlying focal consolidation cannot be entirely excluded in this
 portable examination.
 2.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle reflect moderate amount of pleural
 fluid.  Small right pleural effusion
 3.  Low lung volumes and cardiomegaly.
