 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  There is persistent collapse of the left lower lobe with an
 associated layering effusion.  Pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded.  A
 patchy opacity at the right medial lung base has developed and more likely
 reflects atelectasis in the setting of low volumes, although again pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  The heart remains
 stably enlarged.
