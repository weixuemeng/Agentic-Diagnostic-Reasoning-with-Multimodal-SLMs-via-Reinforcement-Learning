 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip
 in the distal SVC.  The tracheostomy tube and feeding tube are likely
 unchanged in position.  There is a diffuse bilateral reticulonodular
 interstitial process with no focal area of consolidation.  These findings
 could reflect an atypical infectious process or interstitial edema.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
