 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // please evaluate for acute
 cariopulmonary process      please evaluate for acute cariopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low lung volumes
 that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm is seen. Continued blunting of the posterior left
 costophrenic angle, consistent with pleural effusion or possible pleural
 thickening.  The possibility of a superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Upper lungs are essentially
 clear.
