                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is at least moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities
 are noted in the lung bases, more focal in the left lung base likely
 reflecting areas of atelectasis.  No Large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Evidence of prior kyphoplasty is seen within the upper lumbar
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, more pronounced in the left
 lung base, likely atelectasis.  Please note however that infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
