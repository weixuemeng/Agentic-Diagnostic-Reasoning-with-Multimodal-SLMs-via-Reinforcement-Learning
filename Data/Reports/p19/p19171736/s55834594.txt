                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx CHF, BNP ___// eval for pulm edema 
 eval for pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate what is mild pulmonary edema if any. 
 Consolidation at the left lung base however is probably genuine, either
 atelectasis or recent major aspiration or pneumonia.  An apparent intraluminal
 nodule at the bifurcation of the left main bronchus could be an overlying
 artifact.  Re-evaluation with conventional radiographs is recommended, when
 feasible.  Small pleural effusions are likely.  No pneumothorax.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiographs, conventional if possible, at
 full inspiration to evaluate left bronchial tree and the severity of pulmonary
 edema and left lower lobe consolidation if any.
