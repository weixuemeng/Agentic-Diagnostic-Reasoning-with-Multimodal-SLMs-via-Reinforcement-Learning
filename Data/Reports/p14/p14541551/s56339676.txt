                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 The upper lungs are obscured by the patient's chin.  Compared with ___ at
 1:41 a.m., there is new atelectasis and ? new patchy opacity at the right
 base, with minimal pleural thickening.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 mild vascular plethora, but no overt CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and prominent pulmonary arteries are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Mild pulmonary vascular plethora may be slightly worse.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 2) New patchy opacity right base, question atelectasis.  However, early
 pneumonic opacity or aspiration cannot be excluded.
