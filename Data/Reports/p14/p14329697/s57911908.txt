 yesterday
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Evaluation somewhat limited due
 to underpenetration in the setting of low lung volumes. Allowing for this,
 there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
