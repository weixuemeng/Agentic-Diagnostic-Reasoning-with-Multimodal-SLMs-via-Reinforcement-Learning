                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive sputum.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains at the upper limits of normal in size or slightly enlarged.  No
 definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is seen.  This could represent a small effusion or possibly
 some interval pleural thickening since the prior study.
