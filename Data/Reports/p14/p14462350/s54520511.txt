                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, status post aggressive Lasix diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in
 the proximal SVC.  There is no significant interval change in the extent of
 pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema from ___.  Opacification
 at the left lung base is unchanged, likely reflecting a small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.  There is improved aeration of
 the right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged, but stable.  The mediastinal contours are prominent, but
 unchanged.  There is partial calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change in pulmonary vascular congestions/interstitial
 edema from ___ with improved aeration at the right lung base.
