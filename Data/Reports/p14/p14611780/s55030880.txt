                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   AICD unchanged with leads
 extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Cardiomegaly is again
 noted, mild with no convincing signs of pneumonia or edema.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  No convincing signs of
 congestion.  Subtle calcific density projecting adjacent to the AICD pack in
 also in the right mid lung may represent areas of pleural calcification though
 this is unclear.  No acute bony injury.  Chronic right seventh rib deformity
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly unchanged.  No edema or pneumonia.  Areas of calcification
 projecting over the left and right mid lung may reside within the pleural
 though a CT may be performed to further assess on a nonemergent basis.
