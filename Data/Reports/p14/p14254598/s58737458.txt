                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with NSCLC status post chest tube removal
 for left pleural effusion, check pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 303 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval removal of the left basilar pigtail catheter.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  There continues to be elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with a patchy opacity in the left mid and lower lung, which
 could reflect combination of the known left upper lobe malignancy as well as
 some scattered areas of atelectasis given correlation with selected images
 from a chest CT dated ___. The right lung remains grossly clear. 
 Compared to the prior study of ___, there is likely no significant
 interval change.   Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to
 assess due to the left airspace disease.
