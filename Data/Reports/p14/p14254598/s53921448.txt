 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 7:20 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of pigtail catheter which has its tip in the left
 costophrenic angle.  There has been interval decrease in a left pleural
 effusion where there is now patchy airspace disease within the left mid and
 lower lung which could reflect residual atelectasis, re-expansion pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Left hemidiaphragm
 remains elevated.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given
 the left airspace disease.
