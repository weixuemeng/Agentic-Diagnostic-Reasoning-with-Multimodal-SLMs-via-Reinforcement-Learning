 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with EtOH cirrhosis  // Dobhoff placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Sequential portable AP radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Dobbhoff catheter terminates in the right atrium.  A newly placed
 feeding tube initially ends in the mid-esophagus, but is advanced into the

 opacities are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are within normal limits despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly placed feeding tube coils in stomach.
 Unchanged bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities which may be due to
