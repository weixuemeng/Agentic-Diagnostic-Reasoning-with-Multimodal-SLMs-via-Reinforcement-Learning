 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed. The right subclavian catheter has been pulled back to the mid to
 lower portion of the SVC. The other monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  The diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications have
 decreased, most likely reflecting improvement in pulmonary vascular status.
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, this also could reflect
 improving pneumonia or ARDS.
