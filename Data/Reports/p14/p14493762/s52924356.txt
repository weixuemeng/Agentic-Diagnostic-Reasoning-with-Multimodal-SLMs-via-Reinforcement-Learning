                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis  // Dobhoff placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ 12:02PM
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed earlier today, there has been interval
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube which terminates in the distal esophagus.  As
 mentioned in a prior report, the left PICC again terminates at the
 brachiocephalic-SVC junction. The left hemodialysis catheter terminates in the
 right atrium.
 
 The lungs are free of focal consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 Stable appearance of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The rounded left
 perihilar density thought to represent an end-on view of a pulmonary vessel as
 described on the prior CXR is not well visualized on this study. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Dobbhoff tube terminates in the distal esophagus.
 2. Tip of the left-sided PICC line is seen at the brachiocephalic-SVC
 junction.
 3.  The left perihilar density thought to represent an end-on view of a
 pulmonary vessel on the prior CXR is not well visualized on the current study,
 possibly due to patient rotation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Finding #1 telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 4:03PM, time of discovery.
