 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein
 catheter was removed and replaced by a hemodialysis catheter. The patient has
 also received a new feeding tube. This feeding tube is coiled in the stomach,
 the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach.
 The lung volumes continue to be low and the size of the cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged.  The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, likely
 reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, are not
 substantially changed.  No larger pleural effusions.  No visible free
 intra-abdominal air.
