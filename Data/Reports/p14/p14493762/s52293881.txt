                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute severe abdominal pain, peritoneal exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may suggest the
 presence of a tiny left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities. A remote fracture of the left fifth
 lateral rib is noted.  Left subdiaphragmatic lucency is concerning for
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumoperitoneum. Bibasilar atelectasis. Possible trace left pleural effusion.
 A subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis has already been obtained at this
 time.
