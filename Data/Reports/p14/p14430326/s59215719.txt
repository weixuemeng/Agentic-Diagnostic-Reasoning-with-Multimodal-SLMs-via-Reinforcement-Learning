                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sudden onset of pain with inspiration. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded. An ill defined opacity in the left
 lower lung field might represent summation of structures but a pulmonary
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill defined opacity in the left lower lung field might represent
 summation areola and other structures, but to evaluate possible small lung
 lesion the ED Resident has agreed to request a repeat frontal radiograph with
 the arms elevated, to be reported separately when obtained.
