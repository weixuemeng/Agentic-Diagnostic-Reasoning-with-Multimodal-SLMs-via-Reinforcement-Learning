                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope and chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  On the lateral view, the patient's arm overlies part of the
 chest, making the evaluation suboptimal.  Given the above, there is prominence
 of the hila which may be due to pulmonary edema.  Left base retrocardiac
 opacity is seen, which could relate to prominent vasculature or underlying
 atelectasis; however, underlying infection or aspiration not excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although trace pleural effusions are difficult
 to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aortic knob was
 calcified.  Degenerative changes are seen in the shoulder joints which are
 high riding, seen in rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment; however, there appears to be
 prominence of the hila concerning for pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac left base
 opacity could relate to prominent vasculature; however, underlying atelectasis
 or consolidation not excluded.
