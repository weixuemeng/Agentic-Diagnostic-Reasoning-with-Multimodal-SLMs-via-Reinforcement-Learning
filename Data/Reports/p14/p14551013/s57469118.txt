                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:26 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypotension.  Concern for pneumonia or
 mediastinal widening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, smaller on the right and
 larger on the left than in ___.  Moderate right basal atelectasis is
 approximately the same.  The right lung is free of edema.  Left lower lobe is
 probably collapsed, due in part to the large hiatus hernia.  The extent of
 gaseous dilatation of the intrathoracic stomach is no more pronounced today
 than it has been.  I would monitor its appearance and the degree of gas
 passing into the upper abdomen to detect incarceration although there is no
 change in the configuration of the gas bubble or wall thickening to suggest
 that currently.  Heart is enlarged but difficult to assess directly because of
 the adjacent left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  It does not look any
 larger today than it did in ___.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
