                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, evaluate for widened
 mediastinum or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Lateral view raises question of platelike
 atelectaisis anteriorly, but this may represent an artifact due to conflucence
 of vascular and osseous shadows. Otherwise, both lungs are clear with no focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  Continued fullness of both hila
 corresponding to prominent lymph nodes on CT and are unchanged from the prior
 examination. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
