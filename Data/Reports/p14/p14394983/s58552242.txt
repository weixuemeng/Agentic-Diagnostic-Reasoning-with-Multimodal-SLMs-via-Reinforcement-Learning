  Thickening of the pulmonary fissures suggest diffuse mild edema or bronchial
  constriction.  Lower lung volumes can be confounding and cause crowding of
  bronchovascular structures.  If symptoms persist, repeat chest radiograph
  later today is recommended.

  Lower lung volumes causing crowding of bronchovascular structures.  No
  evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, epigastric abdominal pain s/p
 cocaine use.  Intrathoracic abnormality?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior studies, lung volumes are lower, causing crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  Thickening of the pulmonary fissures suggests
 diffuse mild edema or severe bronchial constriction.  This can be confounded
 by the low lung volumes.  The heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lungs are otherwise clear without pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Thickening of the pulmonary fissures suggest diffuse mild edema or bronchial
 irritation.  Lower lung volumes can  cause crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If symptoms persist, repeat chest radiograph later today
 is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings and recommendation were communicated at 7:58
 via telephone by Dr. ___ to ___ (Medical student in ED) who
 will place order for repeat chest radiograph if symptoms persist.
