                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 14:27
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old, followup for a left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:58am.
 
 Portable AP chest film dated ___ at 14:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A single-lead left-sided pacing device is in place with the lead
 terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The left apical pneumothorax has
 decreased in size with no definite pneumothorax on the current study.  Heart
 remains stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema, focal airspace consolidation or pleural effusions.  Streaky
 linear opacities at the left base most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis
 or post-inflammatory scarring.
