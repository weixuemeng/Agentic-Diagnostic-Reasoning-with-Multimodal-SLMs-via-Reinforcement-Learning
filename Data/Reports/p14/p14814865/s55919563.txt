                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:58
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new pacemaker, evaluate lead placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 12:05 a.m.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:58 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Single-lead left-sided pacemaker is now in place with the lead terminating
 over the expected location of the right ventricle.  There is interval removal
 of the right internal jugular temporary pacing wire.  There has been interval
 appearance of a small left apical pneumothorax.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 suggesting underlying emphysema.  There are streaky linear opacities at the
 left base, which may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart remains stably enlarged with an aortic
 CoreValve in place.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Minimal blunting of
 both costophrenic angles likely reflect either small effusions or chronic
 pleural thickening.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no
 obvious vertebral compression fracture.  Results of this examination were
 conveyed to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 11:46 a.m.
 at the time of discovery.
