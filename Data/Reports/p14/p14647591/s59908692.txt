                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with possible pulmonary embolism. 
 Baseline chest examination prior to VQ scan.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained
 on ___ in the emergency unit.
 
 The heart size remains unchanged as before.  The thoracic aorta is moderately
 widened and elongated and shows some calcium deposits in the wall at the level
 of the arch.  Slight deviation of the descending aorta to the left and
 posteriorly at the level of the left atrium supports the impression that there
 is at least moderate left atrial enlargement.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern and there exists some
 perivascular haze at the bases.  Significant pleural effusion in either
 lateral or posterior pleural spaces cannot be identified.  Increased
 visibility of pulmonary fissures on the lateral view is supportive of the
 assumption of mild chronic CHF.  Acute discrete pulmonary infiltrates cannot
 be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiac enlargement, absence of advanced pulmonary
 congestion, no evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or massive pleural effusion.
