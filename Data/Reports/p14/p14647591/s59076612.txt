                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is moderate to severely enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unremarkable.  Increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally which appear slightly more pronounced along
 the periphery may suggest a chronic interstitial lung disease although a
 superimposed mild interstitial pulmonary edema may be present.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Right apical pleural
 thickening is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally which appear more pronounced
 peripherally may suggest an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease,
 although mild interstitial pulmonary edema is not excluded.
