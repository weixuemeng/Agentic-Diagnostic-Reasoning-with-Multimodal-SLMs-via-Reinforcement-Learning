                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  HIV, CD count 138, found down at home for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 areas of bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity
 most likely relates to atelectasis, although a superimposed early infectious
 process is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Additional patchy left basilar
 retrocardiac opacity most likely representing atelectasis, although infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
