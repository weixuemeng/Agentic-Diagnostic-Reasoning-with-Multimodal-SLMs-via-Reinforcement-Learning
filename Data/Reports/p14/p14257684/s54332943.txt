 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  Minimal left
 basilar opacity persists and is likely due to atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Hypertrophic changes are seen in the spine.  There is no visualized displaced
 rib fracture on this single chest x-ray.  Degenerative changes are noted at
 the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  No visualized
 displaced rib fracture.  If high clinical concern and if desired, dedicated
 rib series can be obtained.
