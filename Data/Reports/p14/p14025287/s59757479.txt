                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY: Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT studies from
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  A density projecting over the right upper lung and course of the
 right anterior third rib may reflect a flat subpleural opacity seen on the
 prior chest CT studies.  It shows apparent increased conspicuity since the
 prior radiographs.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute process.
 
 2.  Apparent increase in nodular focus in the right upper lung, which may
 correspond to a previously seen subpleural opacity on prior chest CT. 
 Although the possibility of true change is difficult to judge by comparing
 radiographs, since there is a suggestion of increase, a follow-up chest CT is
 recommended to evaluate further and exclude developing malignancy.
 
 An email regarding the recommendation for chest CT follow-up was sent to the
 ED ___ nursing group on ___ at 10:30 pm.
