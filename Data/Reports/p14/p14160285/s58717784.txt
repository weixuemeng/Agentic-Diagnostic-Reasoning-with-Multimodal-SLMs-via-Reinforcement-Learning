                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval heart and lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes leads to crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 Retrocardiac airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. The upper lungs
 are grossly clear. Mild tortuosity to the descending thoracic aorta is
 present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis without overt pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
