                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the antrum of the stomach.  Continued
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though the region behind the heart could
 easily hide a consolidation.
