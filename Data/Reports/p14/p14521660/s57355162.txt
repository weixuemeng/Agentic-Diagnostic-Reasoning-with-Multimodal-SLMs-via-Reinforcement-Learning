                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic colon CA s/p spinal fusion.
 Febrile.  // r/o infectious process      r/o infectious process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 All AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 20:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hardware now overlies the mid thoracic spine.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable although difficult to assess due to patient
 rotation.  There is improved aeration at the right base and interval
 appearance of a linear opacity at the left base likely reflecting subsegmental
 atelectasis.  A superimposed infectious process would be much less likely. 
 The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated possibly related to prominent air
 within the splenic flexure.  No pulmonary edema.  No large effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
