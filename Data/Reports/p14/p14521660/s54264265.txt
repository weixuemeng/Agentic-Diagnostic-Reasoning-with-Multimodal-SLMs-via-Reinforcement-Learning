                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with b/l pleural effusions becoming more
 tachypneic // assess for new causes of SOB, interval change in pleural
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 CT chest with contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, bibasilar atelectasis has
 worsened.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 Vascular congestion on left has slightly increased, which may represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or layering effusion.  No new focal consolidation. 
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiac size, while difficult to assess the presence of
 effusion, is likely mildly enlarged, stable.  Port-A-Cath tip remains in
 standard position.  Posterior spinal fusion hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
 2. Increased vascular congestion on the left may represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or layering effusion.
 3. Worsening mild bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
