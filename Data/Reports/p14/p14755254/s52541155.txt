                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tbi concern for aspn  // assess for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion are accompanied by slight worsening of pulmonary edema. 
 Additionally, a nonspecific worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region
 could potentially be due to a developing pneumonia given clinical suspicion
 for this process.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this
 regard.  Small pleural effusions are also noted.
