 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged, with leads
 again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 chest is hyperinflated.  Fissures are perhaps slightly more thickened.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild interstitial abnormality
 appears increased, overall probably slight congestion.
