                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated w/aspiration pna  // any change in
 infiltrates?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, pulmonary edema has
 significantly improved, now right greater than left and mild to moderate
 overall.  Retrocardiac opacification and opacification in the right mid to
 lower lung have minimally improved and likely reflect atelectasis, though
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural effusion
 persist.  Trace, if any, effusion on the left.  No new focal consolidation. 
 No pneumothorax.  Mild central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Cardiopulmonary support devices are
 in unchanged standard placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of alveolar pulmonary edema, now right greater than
 left and overall mild to moderate.
 2. Mildly improved retrocardiac opacification and right middle and lower lung
 opacification, reflecting atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
 3. Persistent small effusion on the right.  Trace, if any, effusion on left.
 4. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild central vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.
