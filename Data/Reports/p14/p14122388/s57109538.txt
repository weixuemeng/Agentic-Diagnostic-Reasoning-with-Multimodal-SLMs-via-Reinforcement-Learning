 source.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated without definite focal consolidation.  Lucency in the
 retrosternal region is likely artifactual in nature.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Compression deformities of the thoracic vertebral bodies are again noted. 
 Embolization coils project over the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs without focal consolidation.  Anterior substernal lucency
 is likely artifactual.  Repeat lateral radiograph is recommended to exclude an
 anterior pneumothorax if there is high clinical suspicion.
