                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is seen.  The feeding tube is now visualized
 below the diaphragm.  It crosses midline and then curves upwards.  This likely
 is still within the stomach rather than within the duodenum.  The appearance
 of the lungs and pleural plaques are unchanged.
