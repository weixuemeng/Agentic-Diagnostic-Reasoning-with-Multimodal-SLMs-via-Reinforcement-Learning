                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:40
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year old with leak in chest tube, status post
 draining of pleural effusion, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 11:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right subclavian Port-A-Cath with its tip in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged.
 Right basilar chest tube unchanged in position.  Overall, the pleural effusion
 is somewhat smaller and there may be some loculated air at the right medial
 base.  The ill-defined appearance and fullness of the right hilar region is
 stable, and likely is related to the patient's known disease process.  The
 left lung remains clear.  A calcified AP window lesion likely represents a
 calcified node related to prior granulomatous infection.
