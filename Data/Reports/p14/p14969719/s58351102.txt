                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of chest were reviewed in comparison
 with prior radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following right thoracocentesis, a large right pleural effusion has
 substantially improved with residual mild-to-moderate fluid.  Mediastinum is
 central in position.  Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung is
 consolidation unless proven otherwise.  A 5.5 discrete, nodular opacity in the
 left mid lung is a calcified granuloma as demonstrated from CT component of
 PET/CT dated ___. Mild atelectasis is present in the right lower
 lung and middle lobe.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Following thoracocentesis, large right pleural effusion has substantially
 resolved with residual mild-to-moderate fluid and minimal right lung base and
 middle lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Opacity in the right upper lobe is consolidation unless otherwise proven.
 3.  5.5-mm granuloma in the left mid lung
