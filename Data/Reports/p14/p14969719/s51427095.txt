                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath after thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___ at 13:18 and ___
 chest radiograph ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 terminates within the SVC.  Calcified prevascular lymph node is
 redemonstrated.  A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion appears similar
 when compared to the prior reference chest radiograph, and has increased when
 compared to the prior chest radiograph of ___.  Previously noted
 right upper lobe consolidation persists, and may be slightly improved when
 compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Left basilar
 atelectatic changes are present.  The mediastinal contours appear unchanged,
 and assessment of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult given the presence
 of the moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, increased when compared
 to prior radiograph from ___.  No pneumothorax.
