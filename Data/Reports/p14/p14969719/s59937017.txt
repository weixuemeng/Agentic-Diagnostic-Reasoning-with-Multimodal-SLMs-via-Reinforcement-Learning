                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cancer and pleural effusion status post
 chest tube placement.  Evaluate for change.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___ and FDG-PET from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 There is little change since ___. A right subclavian approach port tip
 remains in the lower SVC. two chest tubes overlie the right base with lucency
 demonstrated about one, which may represent a small basilar pneumothorax.
 
 There is a moderate right pleural effusion with pleural fluid demonstrated
 layering along the apex and also demonstrated along medially adjacent to the
 mediastinum.  There is persistent asymmetric opacification with increased
 asymmetric pulmonary vascularity involving the right lung.  There is moderate
 right lower lobe atelectasis and minimal left basilar atelectasis.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  A calcified lymph node is demonstrated in the region of the
 aortopulmonary window, stable since ___.  Evaluation of her heart size is
 limited in the setting of diffuse right-sided central opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change since ___. A moderate right pleural
 effusion and asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax is likely
 related to progressive changes related to her known disease process/and or a
 component of asymmetric edema.
