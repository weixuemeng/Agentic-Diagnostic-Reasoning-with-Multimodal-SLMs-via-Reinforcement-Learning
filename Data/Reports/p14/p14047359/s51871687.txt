                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, chest pain, question pneumonia, intrapulmonary
 process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:14 a.m.  
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The azygos vein appears
 prominent, measuring ___.5 mm.  This could reflect magnification on this
 portable view;  however, the azygous vein  does appear more prominent than on
 the  ___ CXR.  There is borderline upper zone redistribution, but no overt
 CHF.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No effusion.  There is some increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Incidental note is made of a subchondral cyst in the right
 humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, which appears more pronounced than on the prior film. 
 If clinically indicated, lateral view could help to assess for a pneumonic
 infiltrate in this location.
 2.  Mild prominence of the azygos vein, though this is likely accentuated by
 magnification.
 3.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
