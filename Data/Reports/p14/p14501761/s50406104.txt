                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for pulmonary lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 and there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal
 pneumonia.  Curious linear artifacts posteriorly on the lateral view most
 likely represent folds in the covering sheet.
