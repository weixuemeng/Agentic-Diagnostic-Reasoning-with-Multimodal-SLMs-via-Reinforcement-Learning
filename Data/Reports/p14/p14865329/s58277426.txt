                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dementia with ___ body, seizure disorder, chronic bradycardia,
 found down at nursing home.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:31 a.m.
 
 There is rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, an ET tube is present, with
 tip 6.1 cm above the carina, at the level of the upper clavicular heads.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  A right-sided
 PICC line is present, tip overlying proximal/mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected. 
 
 At the periphery of these films, fixation screws are noted in the lower
 cervical spine.  
 
 There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There is minimal
 patchy opacity at the right base.  There is a small left effusion and possible
 tiny right effusion.  Doubt CHF.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and
 prominence of the mediastinal contours, unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Bilateral effusions and collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior
 film.  Possible slight clearing of the atelectasis/pleural fluid at the right
 base.  
 2) Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, which appears stable.
