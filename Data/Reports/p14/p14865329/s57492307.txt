  PICC appears to terminate in the upper SVC. The previous fold does not seen on
  this view, although that may be because of simply positioning. Would recommend
  repeating the radiograph to assure that the PICC line is downgoing as the
  bottom most edge is difficult to make out on this limited portable view.
