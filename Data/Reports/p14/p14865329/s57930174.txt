                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall, worsening pulmonary status.  Question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:01 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, an ET tube is present, tip
 approximately 6.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending
 beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A right subclavian PICC line is present,
 tip over mid SVC.  At the periphery of these films, the patient's cervical
 spine fixation hardware is noted.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, with prominent hila, but grossly
 unchanged.  There is hazy opacity at the left lung base, with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, and more patchy opacity at the right lung base.
 These findings are similar to the prior film.  Possible minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, but no other evidence of effusion.  Although
 there is suggestion of vascular plethora, there is no upper zone
 redistribution or other findings to confirm CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite change compared with one day earlier.  Bibasilar
 collapse and/or consolidation again noted.
