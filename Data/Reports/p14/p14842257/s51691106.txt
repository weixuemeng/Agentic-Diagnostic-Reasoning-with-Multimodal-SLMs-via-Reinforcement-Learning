 HISTORY:  Thrombocytosis, alcohol abuse.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vasculature normal.  Hazy opacity within the right lung base is likely located
 within the right middle lobe, and is concerning for an area of infection.  The
 component of this opacity appears to reflect the right nipple.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Ill-defined hazy opacity in the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of
 this finding.
