                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left pleural effusion with new left chest
 tube  // evaluate for chest tube positioning, pnueumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new left-sided chest tube with interval decrease in the left
 pleural effusion which is still moderate in size.  There has been some
 interval partial improved aeration of the left lower lobe however volume loss
 is still present in that region.  There is a small amount of volume loss the
 right lobe but overall the aeration is better than on the prior study.  There
 continues to be vascular redistribution compatible with mild fluid overload
