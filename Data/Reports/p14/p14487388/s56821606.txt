                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Large left pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Left-sided
 cardiac and hilar borders are obscured, but otherwise cardiac, mediastinal
 borders are visualized and appear unchanged.  The right lung remains clear
 without pleural effusion.  On the left, the lower half of the hemithorax is
 opacified with a large pleural effusion and probably extensive atelectasis,
 noting no net shift in mediastinal structures.  Projecting over the lateral
 left lung apex, a small new vague area of nodularity measuring up to about 10
 mm is noted either within the lung parenchyma or perhaps associated with
 subpleural thickening or sclerosis in the left second rib, but new since the
 prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large pleural effusion with the suspected atelectasis.  Small nodular opacity
 in the left upper lung of unclear etiology.  Investigation with CT, preferably
 with intravenous contrast is suggested when clinically appropriate.
