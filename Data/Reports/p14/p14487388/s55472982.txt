                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of afib on warfarin, diabetes, hypertension, and
 CHF with EF of ___% presented with hyponatremia for 1 month and worsening
 left pleural effusion, concerning for malignancy induced SIADH.  // Assess
 interval effusion changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the pigtail catheter at the left lung base.  Also again seen is
 a small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is slightly less aeration in the
 retrocardiac region, but the overall appearance is otherwise similar.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, with mild vascular plethora, without other
 evidence of CHF.  There is minimal atelectasis the right lung base and
 possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged, with sternotomy wires
 noted.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate left pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation and left lung base pigtail catheter.
 
 Overall, the appearance is similar to ___ at 13:  ___ pm.  However, the
 degree of aeration in the retrocardiac region is slightly decreased. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
