                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  MVR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to post-operative chest radiographs
 since ___ show stable moderate bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Upper lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax, though
 there is a small pocket of retrosternal air commonly seen after sternotomy. 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.  Diameter of the cardiac
 silhouette is greater now than it was either preoperatively earlier in the
 postoperative period.  Some of this is probably due to accumulation of
 mediastinal fluid, but it should be followed.
