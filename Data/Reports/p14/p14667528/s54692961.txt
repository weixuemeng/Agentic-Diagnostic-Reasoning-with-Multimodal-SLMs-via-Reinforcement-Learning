                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New right-sided weakness, stroke workup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given the patient's rotation, the mediastinum and cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There is a left-sided pacemaker battery
 pack with leads terminating in the right ventricle and right atrium, in
 unchanged position from the prior study.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle on the AP view is not collaborated on the lateral view; therefore no
 pleural effusion is thought to be present.
 
 A retrocardiac opacity is present and may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and aspiration.  Pneumonia cannot be ruled out in the correct
 clinical setting.  There is no pulmonary edema and there is no pneumothorax. 
 There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity concerning for atelectasis versus pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting.
