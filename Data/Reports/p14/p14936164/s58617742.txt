 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sidden sob  // r/o chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable radiograph of the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are slightly low, with pulmonary vascular congestion and
 peribronchial cuffing, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacity
 in the left midlung could reflect atelectasis with superimposed edema, however
 infection cannot be excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with with left midlung streaky opacity, possibly
 infectious in the appropriate clinical setting.
