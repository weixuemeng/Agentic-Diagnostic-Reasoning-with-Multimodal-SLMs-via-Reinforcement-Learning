                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea on exertion, minimal tobacco and
 asbestos exposure.  Evaluation for pulmonary fibrosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison films are available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is a 6 cm,
 relatively lucent right cardiophrenic mass which is best seen on the PA view. 
 The etiology of this mass is unclear, although it may represent a large fat
 pad, pericardial cyst, lipoma or fat-containing hernia.  Due to a lack of
 prior imaging, a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended.  There are large
 lung volumes with associated flattening of the diaphragm.  There is also some
 attenuation of apical pulmonary vascular structures, consistent with
 emphysematous change.  The bilateral costophrenic angles demonstrate some
 linear opacification which may represent scarring or atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Right cardiophrenic mass of unclear etiology but may represent a large fat
 pad, lipoma, pericardial cyst, or Morgagni hernia. Without prior imaging,
 recommend CT of the chest to better evaluate this area.  
 
 Hyperexpanded lungs, suggestive of COPD. No CXR evidence of interstitial lung
 disease, but CT (if obtained) would provide more detailed assessment of the
 interstitium.
