                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT
 torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs appear clear
 bilaterally.  The previously detected opacity in the left lower lung appears
 to have resolved, though evaluation on a chest radiograph is suboptimal to
 assess complete resolution.  Would recommend non-emergent CT of the chest to
 ensure resolution of the previously detected lingular opacity as well as
 multiple additional lung nodules described in detail on prior CT chest.
 Cardiomediastinal sillouhette appears normal. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute findings. Given findings on CT dated ___, a
 nonemergent 3 month f/u chest CT is appropriate to ensure complete resolution
 and/or stability of nodules per ___ guidelines.
