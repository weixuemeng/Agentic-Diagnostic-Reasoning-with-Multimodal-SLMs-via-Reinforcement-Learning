  1.  Persistent left upper lobe and left perihilar opacity compatible with
  known malignancy.
  2.  New retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis given
  elevation of left hemidiaphragm, however cannot exclude superimposed
  infection. Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new diagnosis of lung cancer, now with fever
 and subjective dyspnea  // eval for consolidation, effusions     eval for
 consolidation, effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 left perihilar and upper lung opacification consistent with the known
 malignancy.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with some
 retrocardiac opacification. This most likely represents atelectasis, although
 in the appropriate clinical setting setting superimposed pneumonia could be
 considered.
