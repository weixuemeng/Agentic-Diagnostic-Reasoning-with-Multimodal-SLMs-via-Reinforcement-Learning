                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with found down*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // ? acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is noted, terminating in the low SVC.  The right
 causing angles not fully included.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta somewhat tortuous.  There it is central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Opacity projecting over the left upper hemi thorax is seen which
 could be due to consolidation versus overlap of structures.  Suggest dedicated
 PA and lateral views when patient able, or at minimum, followup when patient
 able.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Limited assessment of
 the osseous structures demonstrates no displaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 Opacity projecting over the left upper hemi thorax could be due to
 consolidation versus overlap of structures.  Suggest dedicated PA and lateral
 views for better assessment if patient able, or at minimum followup to
 resolution.
