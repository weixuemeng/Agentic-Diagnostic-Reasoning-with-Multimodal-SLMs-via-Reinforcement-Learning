                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, please assess
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall exam is unchanged with expected postoperative appearance of
 the mediastinum given neoesophagus.  Stable right lower lung atelectasis and
 possible small right pleural effusion are unchanged.    Improved left lower
 lung opacification; however, new nodular opacification is identified in the
 periphery of the left lower lung. Unchanged cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative appearance given esophagectomy. New
 nodular opacity in left lower lung may be residual from improving retrocardiac
 opacity.  Attention on follow-up.
