  Post-op esophagectomy.  Convex right mediastinal contour - likely due to
  gastric pull through.  NG tube tip terminating at level of carina - likely in
  new pull through esophagus.  Right chest tube and mediastinal drains ntoed.
  Right port-a-cath terminating in the right atrium.  No apparent pneumothorax.
  Bibasilar consolidation, L>R, may reflect atelectasis and/or effusion.  Mild
  pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt edema.  Subcutaneous air in
  chest wall bilaterally - expected post-op.  ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Esophagectomy, evaluation for lung expansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Post-esophagectomy.  Convex right mediastinal contour is likely to
 be caused by the gastric pull-through.  The nasogastric tube projecting with
 its tip at the level of the carina.  Right chest tube and mediastinal drains
 are in expected position.  Right Port-A-Cath is terminating with its tip in
 the right atrium.  There is no apparent pneumothorax.  Basilar areas of
 atelectasis, left more than right, are likely to reflect post-operative
 changes.  Mild fluid overload but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. 
 Substantial amount of post-surgical air in the lateral soft tissues.
