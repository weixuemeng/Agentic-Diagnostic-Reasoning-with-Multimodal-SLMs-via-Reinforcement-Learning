                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent pneumonia and esophageal surgery, now
 presents with fever.  Assess for pneumonia and pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate Port-A-Cath tip projecting
 at the cavoatrial junction.  Post-operative changes at the right lower
 hemithorax with possible small right pleural efusion.  No left pleural
 effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.  Mild
 tortuosity of the descending aorta is noted.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No
 new focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  Right paramedial
 opacity adjacent to neoesophagus, likely reflects post-surgical changes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Stable postoperative appearance with small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Right paramediastinal opacity adjacent to neoesophagus, likely reflects
 post-surgical changes, unchanged.
