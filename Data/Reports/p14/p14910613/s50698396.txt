                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and possible heart block.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a curvilinear lucency
 projecting along the inferior cardiac border, somewhat unusual, although this
 may merely reflect aerated lung.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 mild-to-moderately elevated.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute process.  Somewhat unusual curvilinear opacity
 projecting along the inferior cardiac border.  This is not necessarily a true
 abnormality, but the possibility of air in the pericardium could be
 considered.  Acquisition of standard PA and lateral radiographs is suggested
 when clinically appropriate to confirm the probability that this is an
 artifact.
