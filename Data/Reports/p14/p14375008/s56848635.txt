                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain and interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large-bore right-sided central catheter is again seen, unchanged in
 position, terminating in the right atrium.  Minimal increase in opacity at the
 right lung base, worrisome for increase in size of small right pleural
 effusion as well as right basilar consolidation.  There is diffuse increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally, possibly minimally increased as compared to
 prior study, this could be due to pulmonary edema versus chronic lung disease;
 however, these were not seen on ___ CT.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Prominence of the right hilum is stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in right basilar opacity which represent
 combination of worsening pleural effusion and consolidation.  Background of
 pulmonary edema appears slightly increased compared to the prior study.
