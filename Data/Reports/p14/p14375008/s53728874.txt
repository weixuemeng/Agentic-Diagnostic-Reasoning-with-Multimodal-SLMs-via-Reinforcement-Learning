                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size since the
 previous study and has a configuration suggesting possible partial loculation.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  More confluent opacity
 is present in the left perihilar region and to a lesser extent in the left
 retrocardiac area.  Right basilar atelectasis is present adjacent to the
 above-described effusion.  Diffuse osseous changes of renal osteodystrophy are
 present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate in size and
 possibly partially loculated.
 
 2.  Diffuse interstitial edema.
 
 3.  Confluent left juxtahilar opacities which could reflect asymmetrical
 edema, but followup radiographs are suggested after dialysis to exclude an
 infectious process in this region.
