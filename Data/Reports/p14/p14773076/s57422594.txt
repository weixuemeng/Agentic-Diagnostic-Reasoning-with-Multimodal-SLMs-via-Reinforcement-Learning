                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall.  Evaluate for thoracic
 injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fracture or bony abnormalities are identified, although this study is not
 tailored for detection of rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or fracture.  If
 clinically indicated, dedicated views can be obtained for better assessment of
 the ribs as this study is not tailored for detection of rib fractures.
