 WET READ: ___ ___ 2:09 AM
  Since the study of ___ the opacity at the right base appears
  worsened, however this is not significantly different from the study of
  ___ likely reflecting some combination of pleural effusion and
  consolidation.  In the proper clinical setting an underlying pneumonia would
  be difficult to exclude on the basis of this study.  The remaining lung fields
  are clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
