                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with worsening shortness of breath and basilar
 crackles.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  The chest remains
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  There is a diffuse
 non-specific interstitial abnormality, not significantly changed from the
 prior exam.  There is no focal air space opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Allowing for
 technique, the heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged diffuse non-specific interstitial abnormality which
 could be due to mild vascular congestion or chronic emphysema/asthma.  No new
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.
