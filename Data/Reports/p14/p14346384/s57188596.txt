                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  COPD and asthma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated. 
 The pulmonary interstitium is mildly prominent, including peribronchial
 cuffing.  This finding is non-specific but could be seen with mild forms of
 atypical infection or pulmonary congestion, but could coincide with asthma. 
 Right basilar opacity is unchanged and suggests minor scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial abnormality, non-specific but compatible with
 asthma; atypical pneumonia or mild vascular congestion are additional
 possibilities.
