  Significant prominent interstitial markings compatible with interstitial lung
  disease better characterized on prior CT chest.  No lobar consolidation is
  identified.  Bilateral hilar prominence compatible with pulmonary arterial
  hypertension.  Heart size is top normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
  are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with interval desats, thanks  // eval for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___, cardiac enlargement has slightly decreased
 in extent.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement persists, but widespread
 ground-glass opacities have substantially improved, and apparent pleural
 effusions have resolved.  Residual severe diffuse interstitial pulmonary
 fibrosis remains and has been more fully characterized on recent chest CTA ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked improvement in diffuse ground-glass opacities, which for likely due to
 acute pulmonary edema.  Widespread pulmonary fibrosis has been more fully
 characterized by a recent CT.
