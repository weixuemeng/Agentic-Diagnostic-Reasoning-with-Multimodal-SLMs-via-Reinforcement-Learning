                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, admitted for elective
 knee replacement, now with shock.  // please evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema     please evaluate for evidence of pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 and ___.
 
 It is difficult to compare 8 G bedside radiographs with earlier conventional
 chest radiographs.  The Apparent increase in heart size may not be real, and
 the suggestion of new alveolar opacification may be a function of decreased
 resolution.  Possibility of biventricular heart failure is raised however. 
 This does not look like pneumonia.  The pulmonary changes are not prominent
 and therefore probably not accelerated pulmonary fibrosis.
