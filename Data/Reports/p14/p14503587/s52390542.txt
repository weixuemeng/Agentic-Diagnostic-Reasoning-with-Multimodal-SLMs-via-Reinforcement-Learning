                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC  // eval placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the chest x-ray from ___, there has been partial
 interval clearing of the retrocardiac opacity. Faint patchy opacity in the
 right cardiophrenic region is no longer visible. There is upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.
 
 There is a new right subclavian PICC line. The tip is not well visualized. A
 cannot be traced beyond the expected site of confluence of the subclavian and
 innominate veins, in the region of the proximal most SVC. No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right PICC line. Tip not well visualized--?  At Level of proximal-most
 SVC.  The possibility that it extends slightly beyond this cannot be excluded.
 2. Partial interval clearing of retrocardiac opacity and resolution of right
 cardiophrenic region patchy opacity.
