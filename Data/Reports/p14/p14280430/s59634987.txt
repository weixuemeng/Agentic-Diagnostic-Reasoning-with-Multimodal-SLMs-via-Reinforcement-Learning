                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Patchy
 and ill-defined nodular opacities are noted in both perihilar regions with
 peribronchial cuffing, more pronounced on the left.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified, although the patient's neck and chin obscure
 assessment of the medial lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and ill-defined perihilar nodular opacities, more pronounced on the
 left, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.
