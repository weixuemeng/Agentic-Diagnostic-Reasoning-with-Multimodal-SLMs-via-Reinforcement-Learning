                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GNR sputum, open abd, fevers // assess for
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which result in bronchovascular crowding.  Moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable.  There has been interval
 improvement in aeration of the bilateral upper lungs.  New widening of the
 superior mediastinum may be related to central line placement, and may
 represent hematoma or abscess.  The central line ends in the right atrium, in
 unchanged position. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the
 field of view. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slight interval improvement in aeration of the bilateral upper lungs, with
 stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
 
 2. Interval widening of the superior mediastinum may be related to recent
 central line placement, and may represent hematoma or abscess.
 
 3. Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm in the carina and the endotracheal tube cuff
 appears overinflated.
 
 4. Central line ends in the right atrium, in unchanged position.
