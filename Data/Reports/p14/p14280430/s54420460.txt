                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with incarcerated hiatal hernia with septic
 shock s/p ex lap, reduction of hernia, subtotal colectomy for necrosis,
 diagphragmatic repair, ileostomy, fascial closure // interval progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable. There has been interval
 improvement in aeration of the bilateral upper lungs, consistent with improved
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 right-sided central line ends in the right atrium, in unchanged position. 
 Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm from the carina, and the cuff appears
 over-inflated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable.
 Interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm from the carina, and the cuff appears
 over-inflated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
