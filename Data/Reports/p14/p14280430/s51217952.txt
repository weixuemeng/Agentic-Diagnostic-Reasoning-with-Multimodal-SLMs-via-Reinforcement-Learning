                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Enteric
 tube is seen terminating in the region of the midline of the chest, most
 likely within the mid esophagus, does not fully project over the airway;
 however, airway involvement is not entirely excluded.  There is a large area
 of opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung as well as left
 retrocardiac lucency consistent with patient's known large hiatal hernia.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enteric tube terminates in the mid hemithorax in the midline, may be in
 the mid esophagus; however, airway involvement is not excluded, although felt
 unlikely.  Recommend repositioning so that it terminates within the stomach if
 possible.  This was discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ via telephone.
 
 2.  Large area of basilar opacity involving the right mid-to-lower hemithorax
 as well as left base retrocardiac lucency consistent with patient's known
 large hiatal hernia.
