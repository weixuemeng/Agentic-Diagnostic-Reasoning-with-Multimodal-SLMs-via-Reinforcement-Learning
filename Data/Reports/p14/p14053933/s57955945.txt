                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chest pain, evaluate for any
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study dated ___.  Already on the preceding
 study, marked increase of the heart size was noted  in comparison with
 previous chest examinations, which date, almost one year ago.  A chest CT of
 ___, also described evidence of right and left upper lobe
 pulmonary malignancies that have been treated with CyberKnife radiation. 
 Linear mostly atelectatic densities in this areas appear to be remnants of
 these interventions and explain the presence of fiducious mark in the
 territory of the left upper lobe lingula.  The accessible pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested; however, the heart is markedly enlarged.  There
 is now a plate atelectasis in the left lower lobe in retrocardiac position,
 which explains the poor visibility of the diaphragmatic contour, but there is
 no evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinuses.  The thoracic
 aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows extensive wall
 calcifications at the level of the arch.  There is, however, no local contour
 abnormality suspicious for aneurysm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiac enlargement in the absence of significant
 pulmonary congestion.  Consider possibility of pericardial effusion as the
 cause.  Status post upper lobe scars in this patient with history of previous
 CyberKnife therapy.  No evidence of pneumothorax or new acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.
