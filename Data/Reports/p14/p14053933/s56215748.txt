                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the film from two days prior, the retrocardiac
 opacity appears to have improved, although there is still a left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Suprahilar right-sided opacities are related to the patient's known
 malignancy as is the hilar level opacity with fiducial seed.  Cardiac size is
 top normal.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is identified.  There is no
 convincing evidence of pneumonia.  An abnormal contour at the medial aspect of
 the right hemidiaphragm is related to a hiatal hernia as seen on the ___ CT.
