                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is suggestion of a pleural line superimposed over one of the
 ribs, which could represent a pneumothorax.  If clinical symptoms persist,
 repeat study would be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left transbronchial biopsy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  No preoperative comparison is available.  Following transbronchial
 biopsy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Areas of patchy opacification
 are seen bilaterally, possibly relating to chronic changes on the right.  In
 the lingular region, there is some indistinctness of the area of nodule seen
 on CT, possibly relating to some bleeding related to the procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax identified.
