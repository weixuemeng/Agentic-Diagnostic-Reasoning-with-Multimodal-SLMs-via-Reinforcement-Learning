                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with perforated appendicititis, altered mental
 status requiring sedation  // interval change     interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient is rotated severely to the right, and although the right hemidiaphragm
 obscures the right lower lobe, the remainder of the right lung is clear. On
 the left however, partially obscured by external devices, is interstitial
 abnormality, perhaps gravitational edema. I would recommend repeat radiography
 when feasible, carefully positioned, to see if there is a developing
 abnormality in the left lung such as aspiration pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiograph, carefully positioned, with
 external devices removed, primarily for assessment of the left lung.
