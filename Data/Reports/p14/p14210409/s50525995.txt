                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, aspiration risk from dysphagia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is widened, with mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta which demonstrates calcifications.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is noted.  There are bilateral lower lobe opacities, likely
 atelectasis, though non-specific.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which limits assessment of the lung bases. 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis, though repeat study with improved inspiration
 is recommended if there is continued concern for aspiration.
