 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, now with left flank pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  Note is made of an azygous lobe and fissure.  The heart size
 is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  No definite displaced rib
 fractures.  If there is persistent concern for rib fracture, further
 evaluation could be performed with a dedicated rib series including an
 appropriately placed skin marker.
