  Bilateral opacities are worse, which may in part be due to lower lung volumes,
  but are concerning for worsening pulmonary edema. there are probably tiny

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  End-stage renal disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a marked increase in hazy bilateral opacification with a
 predominantly central distribution, most consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Effacement of the left costophrenic sulcus may be due to a small pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema,
 increased since the prior study.
