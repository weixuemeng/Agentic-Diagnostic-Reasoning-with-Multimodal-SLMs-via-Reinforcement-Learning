                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion may be likely
 present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  The apices are obscured
 by overlying external jewelry, but no large pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis, with
 probable small right pleural effusion.
