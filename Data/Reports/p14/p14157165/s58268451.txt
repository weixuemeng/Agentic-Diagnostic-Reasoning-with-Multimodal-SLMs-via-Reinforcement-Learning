                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  
 
 A right IJ line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  No CHF.
 There is plate-like atelectasis in left mid and lower zones. No definite
 infiltrate.  Because the lateral view was obtained only semi-upright, this
 likely distorts the appearance of the dependent vessels. Minimal blunting of
 the costophrenic angles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite focal infiltrate.
