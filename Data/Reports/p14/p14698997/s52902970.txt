                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new onset chest pain and shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are low.  Prominent
 interstitial markings are likely exaggerated due to low lung volumes on the AP
 technique.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or overt edema.  No
 definite consolidation is identified.  Increased density overlying the spine
 on the lateral projection likely represents thoracic osteophytosis as seen on
 prior lateral chest radiograph from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Cardiac silhouette
 is moderately enlarged which is new from prior examination and may reflect
 cardiomegaly or new pericardial effusion.  There is persistent mild elevation
 of the anterior right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, though no definite consolidation or edema.
 2.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is likely exaggerated
 by low lung volumes, but there may be possible new cardiomegaly or interval
 development of a pericardial effusion.
