                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, ascites  // hydrothorax or
 consolidation?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral, right more
 than left, areas of platelike opacities have minimally decreased in extent. 
 However, the morphology could still reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion, better appreciated on the frontal
 than on the lateral radiograph.  No new opacities.  Normal size of the heart.
