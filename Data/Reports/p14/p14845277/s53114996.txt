                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with rheumatic heart disease, AFib, new
 cough, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 158.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer remains in place with the leads terminating in the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. 
 Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged heart and stable
 mediastinal contours.  There is slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm which is
 unchanged and likely chronic.  Streaky opacities at the left base are felt to
 most likely represent subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  The interstitium
 is prominent bilaterally.  This is felt to likely reflect chronic age-related
 changes, small airways disease or smoking-related changes.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia at this time.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  If the
 patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
