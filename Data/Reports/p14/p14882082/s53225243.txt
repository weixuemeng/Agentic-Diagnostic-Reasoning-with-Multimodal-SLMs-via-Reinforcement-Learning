                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old smoker with persistent cough and very malodorous
 sputum.  ___, history of smoke and carcinogen exposure.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Available for comparison is a next preceding chest examination in
 our records dated ___.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Mild widening of the thoracic aorta at the level of the arch, but
 no local contour abnormalities or walled calcifications are identified.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Noted are, however, relatively low
 positioned diaphragms with bilateral basal lung appearance of hyperinflation
 with scarcity of vasculature and some irregularity in the peripheral
 distribution.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  The
 pleural spaces including lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from
 any fluid accumulation and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  In
 comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, findings are rather unchanged.  Hyperinflated base of lungs were noted
 already on the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiac enlargement, pulmonary congestion, but radiographic
 signs compatible with chronic basal emphysema, finding that matches the
 patient's smoking history and smoke exposure.
