 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification has increased at both lung bases.  On the left is due largely to
 consolidation, either collapse or worsening pneumonia.  On the right it is
 probably a combination of dependent edema and at least a small right pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is top- normal, but has increased and there is a
 suggestion of mediastinal venous engorgement.
 
 Right jugular line has been advanced and ends in the upper right atrium.
