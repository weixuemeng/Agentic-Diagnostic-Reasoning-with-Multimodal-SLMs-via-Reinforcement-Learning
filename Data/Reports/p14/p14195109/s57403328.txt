                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left-sided crackles, cough, and
 leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  There are persistently low lung volumes.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion is demonstrated.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm remains with
 associated right basilar atelectasis.  Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities
 also appear relatively unchanged from the most recent previous examination,
 and appears somewhat progressed from ___, potentially reflective
 of known chronic interstitial lung disease with atelectasis.  Clips in the
 right axillary region are re- demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy airspace opacities,
 relatively unchanged from the most recent previous examination but progressed
 from the remote study from ___.  These findings could reflect known chronic
 interstitial lung disease with superimposed atelectasis and scarring.
