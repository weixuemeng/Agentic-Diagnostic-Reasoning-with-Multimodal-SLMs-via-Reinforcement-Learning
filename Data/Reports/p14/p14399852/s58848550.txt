                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided effusion and
 right-sided pneumonia, status post pleural effusion, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding AP and lateral chest examination ___ ___.  Comparison
 of the frontal images demonstrates significant reduction of the right-sided
 basal density indicative of some successful thoracocentesis.  There is no
 evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical area.  There is also some evidence
 of blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus.  The absence of a lateral view
 makes it difficult to assess the amount of pleural effusion.  With the
 exception of a linear plate density on the right base suggestive of a plate
 atelectasis, there are no new pulmonary abnormalities.
