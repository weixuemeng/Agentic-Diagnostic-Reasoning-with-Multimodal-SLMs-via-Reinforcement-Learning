                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.  Evaluate for widened
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The mediastinum on this AP radiograph
 is likely within normal limits with minimal calcification of the aortic arch. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is blunting of the costophrenic
 angles bilaterally suggestive of trace pleural effusions.  Lung volumes are
 low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures and bibasilar
 atelectasis. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Known thyroid
 goiter causes mild narrowing of the upper airway. The known left upper lobe
 mass is not well seen on the current exam. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Possible
 tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  No widened mediastinum.
