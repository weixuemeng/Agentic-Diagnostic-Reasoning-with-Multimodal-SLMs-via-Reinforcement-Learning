                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer and lightheadedness.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS: There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating within
 the mid SVC. Lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
