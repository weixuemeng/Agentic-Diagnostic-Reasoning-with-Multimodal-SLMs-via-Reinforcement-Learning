                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p open heart surgery  // eval for pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:56
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Multiple lines and tubes have been removed.  Right IJ central line remains
 present, tip over proximal SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, consistent with prior surgery and likely accentuated
 by low inspiratory volumes.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again
 noted .  There is increased retrocardiac density,  consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Hazy density both lung bases could
 represent atelectasis and/or small amount of pleural fluid.  No gross effusion
 is identified.  Doubt CHF.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
 2. Hazy density at both lung bases, consistent with atelectasis and/or small
 amount of pleural fluid.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 similar to prior.
 3. No CHF, gross effusion, or pneumothorax detected.
