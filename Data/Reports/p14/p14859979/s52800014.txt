                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p dual chamber PPM.  // Assess leads placement
 and r/o PTx.      Assess leads placement and r/o PTx.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study, there is little change in the appearance of the
 pacer leads on the frontal view.  However, on the lateral view that is
 available only on the current study, what appears to be the ventricular lead
 extends posteriorly.  The output should be checked to make certain that this
 is truly within the right ventricle rather than being malpositioned.
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Check output of pacer lead to make certain that it is
 directly positioned in the right ventricle.
