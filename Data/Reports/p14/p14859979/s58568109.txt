                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p avr status post chest tube removal,
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the midline chest tube, an endotracheal
 tube, and a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter.  There is a trace medial pneumothorax
 versus trace pneumomediastinum.  A prosthetic aortic valve, a dual-chamber
 left pectoral pacemaker and its leads and multiple mediastinal clips project
 in unchanged location.  Follow volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis, similar to the prior study.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, including mild cardiomegaly, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post extubation, removal of a right IJ central venous catheter, and a
 midline chest tube with a trace medial pneumothorax versus trace
 pneumomediastinum.
