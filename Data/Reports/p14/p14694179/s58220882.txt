                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, questionable aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  As a consequence, the lung volumes have decreased and the
 pre-existing areas of bilateral atelectasis have decreased in extent and
 severity.  However, no newly appeared parenchymal opacities are present. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
