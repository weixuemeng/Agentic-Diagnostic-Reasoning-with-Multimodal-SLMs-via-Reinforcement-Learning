                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with duodenum cancer, presenting with sepsis
 and concern for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Accessed right Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged. Right
 lower lung opacities are slightly worse. Linear opacities at the left base
 likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and notable for a prominent ascending
 aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe opacities could represent pneumonia or
 worsening atelectasis.
 2.  Increased left basilar atelectasis.
 3.  Persistent prominence of the ascending aorta is likely related to
 tortuosity or dilatation.
