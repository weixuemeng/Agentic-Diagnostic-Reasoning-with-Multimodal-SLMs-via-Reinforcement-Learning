                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with h/o DVT, here w/ chest pain and b/l ___ edema 
 // eval for pneumonia, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged;
 pericardial effusion is not excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A vague right infrahilar opacity is seen, which appears grossly
 similar to comparison.  This may represent vascular crowding given decreased
 lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No definite acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 2.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, more pronounced than on prior
 examination.  This may be exaggerated due to low lung volumes, however,
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion are not excluded.
