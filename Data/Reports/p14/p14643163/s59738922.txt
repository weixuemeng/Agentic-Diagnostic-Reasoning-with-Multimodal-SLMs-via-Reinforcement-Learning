 ADDENDUM:  Please note the following correction.  Instead of stating "a prior
 fracture of the proximal left femur appears stable," the body of the report
 should state "a prior fracture of the proximal left humerus appears stable".

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is similar, including elevation of the
 stomach bubble.  This appearance may correspond to a Bochdalek hernia, but
 does not appear changed.  Streaky associated opacities can probably be
 explained by atelectasis.  The lung fields appear otherwise clear.  The chest
 is hyperinflated.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  A prior fracture of the proximal left femur
 appears stable.  Mild S-shaped curvature to the thoracolumbar spine appears
 unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute process.  Stable appearance of the chest.
