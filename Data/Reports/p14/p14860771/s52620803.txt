                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses through the esophagus and enters the stomach, although
 its distal course is not imaged.  There is a left infrahilar consolidation
 obscuring the left hemidiaphragm with air bronchograms.  Differential
 considerations include aspiration, atelectasis or infectious pneumonia. 
 Perihilar opacification suggests coinciding mild vascular congestion or fluid
 overload.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload and focal dense left
 lower lung opacity, for which etiologies including aspiration, atelectasis, or
 pneumonia could be considered.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful
 to reassess if clinically appropriate.
