                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ Chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal or hilar
 contours are similar, with tortuosity and diffuse calcifications of the
 thoracic aorta again noted.  As before, there is prominence of the right
 paratracheal stripe which is attributable to the presence of tortuous vessels
 and mediastinal lipomatosis as seen on the prior CT of the chest from ___.  Lateral pleural thickening at the lung bases bilaterally is
 again noted, unchanged.  Streaky airspace opacities in lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  A nephrostomy catheter is noted on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from the prior exam. Mild bibasilar airspace
 opacities which may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
