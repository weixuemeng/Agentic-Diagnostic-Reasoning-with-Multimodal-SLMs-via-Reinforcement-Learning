                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Prostate cancer with chest and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with the heart size mildly enlarged.  Prominence of
 the right paratracheal stripe is attributable to the presence of tortuous
 vessels and mediastinal lipomatosis as seen on the prior CT chest from ___. Lungs are hyperinflated. The pulmonary vascularity is within normal
 limits.  Lateral pleural thickening is noted near the lung bases, stable.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. 
 Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
