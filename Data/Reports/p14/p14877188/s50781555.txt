                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post cardiac arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.4 cm from the carina.  The
 cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are relatively unchanged.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe
 is due to the presence of mediastinal fat deposition.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are noted.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflects
 extrapleural fat deposition as noted on the prior CT.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 
 2. Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific but could
 reflect atelectasis, but aspiration or infection are not excluded.
