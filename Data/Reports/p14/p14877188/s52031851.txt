 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip 4.8 cm above the
 carina.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the
 proximal right atrium.  There is increasing opacity at the left base which may
 represent a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  There is likely
 worsening pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess given marked patient rotation on the current examination.
