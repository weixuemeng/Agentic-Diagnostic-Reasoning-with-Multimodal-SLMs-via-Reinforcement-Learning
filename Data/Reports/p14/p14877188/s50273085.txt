                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:26 AM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated.  Check line placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 22:12.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 5 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube unchanged in position.  Right internal jugular central
 line has its tip in the proximal right atrium, unchanged.  There is a
 worsening airspace process at the left base, which may reflect atelectasis in
 the setting of a pleural effusion.  However, pneumonia and/or aspiration
 should also be considered.  Improvement in mild pulmonary edema with residual
 mild interstitial edema.  Persistent low lung volumes.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the patient rotation on the
 current examination.
