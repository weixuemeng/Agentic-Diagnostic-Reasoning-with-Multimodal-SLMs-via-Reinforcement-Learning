                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subjective fevers, shortness of breath, crackles at the bases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been no significant interval change from the prior study.  There is
 mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is stable.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with tortuosity and calcifications of the
 thoracic aorta again noted.  Fullness of the right paratracheal stripe is also
 unchanged, and compatible with tortuous vessels and mediastinal lipomatosis as
 demonstrated on prior chest CT from ___.  There are persistent
 bibasilar airspace opacities.  Lateral pleural thickening at the lung bases is
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from the prior study.  Continued bibasilar
 airspace opacities which could reflect atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
