                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___ as well as radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a patchy opacification in the left basilar region, but similar to
 prior examinations and suggesting the combination of a prominent epicardial
 fat pad and minor atelectasis or scarring.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear,
 but noting that lateral views are limited by soft tissue attenuation and
 motion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for acute disease.
