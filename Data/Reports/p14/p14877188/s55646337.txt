                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.  Chest CT ___. 
 Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged, with prominent epicardial
 fat pads again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 unchanged widening of the right paratracheal stripe which has been attributed
 to mediastinal lipomatosis and tortuous vessels, better seen on the prior
 chest CT.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bilateral
 inferolateral pleural thickening is again seen.  There are minimal atelectatic
 changes in the lung bases, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.  Partially
 imaged is a nephrostomy catheter within the upper abdomen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
