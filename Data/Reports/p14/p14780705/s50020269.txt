                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cervical fracture, to assess for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged without definite vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with some
 volume loss in the lower lobe.  No definite acute pneumonia, though the area
 behind the heart is difficult to assess in the absence of a lateral view. 
 Port-A-Cath remains in place.
