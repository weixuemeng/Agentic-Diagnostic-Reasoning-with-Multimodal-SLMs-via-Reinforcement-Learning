 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is tilted towards the right.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Patchy
 opacities at the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 focal consolidations.  No pulmonary edema.  The aorta is tortuous.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities at the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis, however an
 early/ developing pneumonia cannot be ruled out and short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful if warranted clinically.  .
