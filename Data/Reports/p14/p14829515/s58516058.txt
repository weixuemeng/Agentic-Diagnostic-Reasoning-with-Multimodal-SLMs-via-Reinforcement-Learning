                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest tube placement  // ct placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 17:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of left pleural catheter.  Left pneumothorax has nearly
 completely resolved, there may be tiny left apical component.  Left basilar
 consolidation, may represent atelectasis, consider infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Left chest wall emphysema is stable.  Shallow
 inspiration accentuates heart size, pulmonary vascularity.  Mildly more
 prominent right basilar opacity, slightly reticulated appearance, atelectasis
 versus infiltrate.  Mild left pleural effusion is more prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval pleural catheter placement.  There may be tiny residual left
 pneumothorax.  Left basilar consolidation, likely atelectasis, consider
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  Mild left pleural effusion is
 more prominent.  Right basilar interstitial prominence, atelectasis versus
 infiltrate.
