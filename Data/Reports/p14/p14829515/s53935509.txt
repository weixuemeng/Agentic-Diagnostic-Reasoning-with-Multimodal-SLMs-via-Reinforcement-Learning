                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cervical esophageal diverticulum resection
 post-op c/b esophageal leak w/stent placement  // please eval for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as the upper GI study dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persisting and mildly increased retrocardiac and left lower lung zone
 opacities which likely reflect a combination of consolidation/ atelectasis and
 a small pleural effusion.  There are no focal consolidations in the right
 lung.  No discrete pneumothorax is identified.
 
 The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 
 A distal esophageal stent is present.  Hyperdense material is noted around the
 mid to distal aspect of the stent, likely contrast material from yesterday's
 upper GI fluoroscopy study. The tip of the right PICC line projects over the
 lower right atrium.  Two left chest tubes are again present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased left mid and lower lung zone opacities, likely reflective
 of worsening consolidation/ atelectasis and a small pleural effusion given the
 known clinical history of an esophageal leak.
