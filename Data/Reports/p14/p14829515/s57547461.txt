                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with esoph leak post esoph diverticulum
 resection  // check position of esophageal stent
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to ___ study the esophageal stent is unchanged in
 position.  There is a change in morphology of the moderate left pleural
 effusion that now again contains air-fluid levels that new or if the
 appearance is due to change in distribution.  A loculated portion of the fluid
 collection persists in the posterior pleural space versus mediastinum.  The
 right lung is clear.  A right PIC line is again seen which terminates in the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable positioning of the esophageal stent.
 2. Morphologically changed left pleural effusion with air-fluid levels that
 represent new air collections or the redistribution of previous loculations.
