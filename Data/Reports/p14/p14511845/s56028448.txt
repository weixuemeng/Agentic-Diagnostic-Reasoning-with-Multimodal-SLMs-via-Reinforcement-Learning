  Slight vascular prominent with enlarged azygous vein and central pulmonary
  vessels.  Patchy posterior opacity; although difficult to exclude pneumonia,
  could be seen with atelectasis.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Morbid obesity and leg swelling with dyspnea on exertion.  History
 of pulmonary hypertension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  Mild unfolding is noted along
 the thoracic aorta.  Central pulmonary arteries are mildly prominent.  The
 azygos vein also appears mildly enlarged, although there is no evidence for
 frank pulmonary edema.  However, the lateral view suggests a patchy posterior
 retrocardiac opacity, most likely within the left lower lobe which is not
 specific as to etiology.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy posterior opacity which is nonspecific; differential
 considerations include pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although
 atelectasis may explain the finding.  Cardiomegaly and slight vascular
 prominence without frank pulmonary edema.
