                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with 16 hours of epigastric abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen with linear
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  There is no free intraperitoneal air
 below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Probable bibasilar
 atelectasis given lower lung volumes.
