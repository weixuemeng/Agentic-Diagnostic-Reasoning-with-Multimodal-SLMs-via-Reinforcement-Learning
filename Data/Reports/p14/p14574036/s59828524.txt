                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of aortic valve replacement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the most recent chest radiograph, the pleural effusions have
 resolved.  Previously noted bibasilar airspace opacities have nearly resolved,
 though a hazy linear opacity at the right base adjacent to the right heart
 border does not obscure the heart border or diaphragm and likely represents
 small amount of atelectasis. Linear opacities in the left lung base are also
 similar, likely scarring or atelectasis. There is no dense consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 A mechanical aortic valve is visualized.  Sternal wires are intact. 
 Underlying emphysema is unchanged. Soft tissue anchors in the right shoulder
 are re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously noted bibasilar airspace opacities have nearly
 resolved, with residual mild right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, though
 infection is not completely excluded.  Previously noted bilateral effusions
 have also resolved.
