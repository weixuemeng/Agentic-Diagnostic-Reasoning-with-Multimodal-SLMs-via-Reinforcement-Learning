                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle increase in opacity at the left lower lobe seen on the frontal view,
 not substantiated on the lateral view may be due to overlap of vascular
 structures, but in the appropriate clinical setting early consolidation is not
 excluded.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle small opacity in the left lower lobe on the frontal view, not
 substantiated on the lateral view, may be due to overlapping structures, but
 early/mild consolidation not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
