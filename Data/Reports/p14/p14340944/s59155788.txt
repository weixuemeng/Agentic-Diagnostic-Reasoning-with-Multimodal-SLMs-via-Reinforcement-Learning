                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper lobe pleural effusion status post left upper lobe
 lobectomy.  The patient has mild dyspnea on exertion and dry cough.  Status
 post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___ at
 15:14.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The large left pleural effusion is decreased as evidenced by
 significantly better visualization of the left hemidiaphragm which was
 previously silhouetted by the pleural effusion.  Significant opacification of
 the left chest is still present and likely represents a combination of
 remaining moderate-to-large pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The right lung
 appears well expanded and clear.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion is decreased following thoracentesis and is
 now medium in size.
