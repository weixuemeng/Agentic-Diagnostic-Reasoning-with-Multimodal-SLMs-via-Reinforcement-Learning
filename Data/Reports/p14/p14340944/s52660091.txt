 squamous cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of the same day

 FINDINGS: Status post left upper lobe wedge resection. A moderate-sized left
 apical pneumothorax remains and is now accompanied by an air-fluid level
 consistent with a hydropneumothorax.  Left basilar atelectasis appears
 increased since the prior exam while minimal right base atelectasis is similar
 to prior. Small dependent left and possible small right effusions.
