                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post VATS of left upper lobe,
 check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___ also paying attention to
 preceding portable chest of ___ and PA and lateral chest of ___.  The on next preceding examination identified apical small
 hydropneumothorax cavity has now filled incompletely indicating progression of
 scar formation.  Left basal pulmonary changes unfortunately have also
 progressed.  Now complete obliteration of the left diaphragmatic contour
 indicating airlessness of the left upper lobes lateral and posterior segments.
 When comparison is extended to the study of ___, at that time
 beginning signs of left lower lobe atelectasis have increased.  Comparison
 made between the lateral views also suggests some new infiltrates higher up
 anteriorly which were not present to the same degree at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal filling of apical remaining hydrothorax cavity. 
 Increasing obliteration of diaphragmatic contour suggests new abnormalities in
 left lower lobe.  Precise evaluation of pulmonary parenchymal versus pleural
 densities is difficult on the portable chest examinations. Clinical assesment
 must decide if a chest CT is required to evaluate further the integrity of
 remaining left lower lobe.
