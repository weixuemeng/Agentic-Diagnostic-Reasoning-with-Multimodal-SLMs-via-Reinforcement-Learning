                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS of the left upper lobe for squamous cell
 carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is unchanged opacification of the surgical cavity and
 unchanged appearance of left basal pulmonary findings including complete
 obliteration of the left diaphragmatic contour.  Additionally, the parenchymal
 densities in the mid left lung are increased from prior examination and may
 represent residual disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of opacities filling the surgical cavity
 with continued stability of left lower opacities obscuring the hemidiaphragm,
 which may represent atelectasis or effusion.  As previously discussed, the
 parenchymal densities in the left mid lung are large compared to prior exam
 and, if clinically indicated, would be amenable to further evaluation by
 dedicated chest CT.
