 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent left upper lobe resection.
 Recently described mediastinal widening is unchanged.  A chest tube remains in
 place in the upper left hemithorax, and there is a persistent small to
 moderate left pneumothorax, with apical visceral pleural line now located just
 below the level of the third posterior left rib.  Multifocal patchy and linear
 atelectasis persists in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.  There is no
 substantial pleural effusion.  Marked gastric distention is observed in the
 imaged portion of the upper abdomen.  Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the
 left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Persistent small to moderate left pneumothorax following left upper lobe
 resection, with chest tube in place. No change in mediastinal widening.
