                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lobectomy, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the moderate left pneumothorax following left upper lobe resection.  Chest
 tube remains in place.  Otherwise, little overall change.  Areas of
 atelectasis persist, especially in the right mid and lower zones.
 
 Previously described gastric dilatation is less prominent at this time.
