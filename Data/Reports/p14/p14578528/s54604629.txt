 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the SVC.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable, and the pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 There appears to be minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally
 posteriorly suggestive of minimal bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Lungs are clear.  A pigtail catheter is seen
 within the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
