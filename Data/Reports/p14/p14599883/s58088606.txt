                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new rib fractures.  Evaluate for atelectasis,
 pneumonia and pulmonary contusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably lower.  New opacification at the lung bases, most
 severe on the left, is presumably atelectasis since both hila are low.  I see
 no substantial pulmonary abnormality to suggest contusion, and there is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Widened mediastinum is probably a function
 of lordotic positioning and low lung volumes.  Stomach is moderately distended
 with air and fluid.  Rib fractures detected on recent torso CT are not visible
 on conventional chest radiographs.
