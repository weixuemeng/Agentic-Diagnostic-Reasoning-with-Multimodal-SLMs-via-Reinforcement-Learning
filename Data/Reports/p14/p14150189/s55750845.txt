                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male which shortness of breath status post
 nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluate for tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis from earlier on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sequential frontal portable radiographs were obtained as the nasogastric tube
 was advanced.  The initial radiograph demonstrates the nasogastric tube in the
 distal esophagus and the final radiograph demonstrates the tip of the
 nasogastric tube in left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach.  Right
 chest wall port catheter terminates in the upper right atrium. Lungs are
 hypoinflated with infrahilar opacities bilaterally which may represent
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be secondary
 atelectasis or a small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Final radiograph demonstrating the tip of the nasogastric tube in the left
 upper quadrant, projecting over the stomach.
