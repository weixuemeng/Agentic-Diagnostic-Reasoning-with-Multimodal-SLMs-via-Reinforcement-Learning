 postop nausea, abd distention, s/p NGT placement  // eval for
 ileus/obstruction, NGT position     eval for ileus/obstruction, NGT position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach.  The side-port is not well
 seen, though is probably at the level of the GE junction.  The tube should be
 pushed forward at least 5 cm for better position.
 Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs except for some
 suggested silhouetting of the outer aspect of the left hemidiaphragm, raising
 the possibility of some atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
