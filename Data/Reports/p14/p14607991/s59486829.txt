                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain and tight breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular hemodialysis port ends at the atriocaval
 junction.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity and a left pleural effusion. 
 The right lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette cannot be determined due to the left pleural effusion.  A small
 amount of subdiaphragmatic free air is noted and expected post-operatively.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Post-operative subdiaphragmatic free air.
