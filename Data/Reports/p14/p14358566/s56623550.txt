 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, there is probable increased vascular plethora
 and increased bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation Increased
 retrocardiac density is similar to the prior film, allowing for differences in
 technique, though the superior left heart border is slightly less distinct. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle noted, suggestive of a small
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with cardiomegaly and
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery and both hila.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspect some increased vascular congestion.  New bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 definite focal infiltrate.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help
 to further assess the lung bases for infiltrate.
