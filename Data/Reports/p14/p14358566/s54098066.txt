  1.  Stable mild vascular congestion.
  2. Improved right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with asymmetric edema
  and atelectasis.
  3. Increased retrocardiac opacity with persistent small left pleural effusion
  is worrisome for pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with xfer from OSH hypoxic to 70s hx of CHF.  Assess for
 interval change in pulm edema, eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.  CT chest
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded with stable vascular congestion.  Improved right
 lower lobe heterogeneous opacity is most consistent with atelectasis and
 asymmetric edema.  Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity persistent small
 left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.  Mild
 prominence of the right hilus is stable dating back to CT chest dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Rapidly Improved right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with
 asymmetric edema and/or atelectasis.
 3.  Increased left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis.
 4.  Persistent small left pleural effusion
