                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, COPD with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature without frank interstitial edema.  Lung volumes are low with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is slightly increased right infrahilar density
 which is improved compared to prior examination where there was a prior
 pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema. 
 Subtle density in the right infrahilar region is improved compared to prior
 examination where there was pneumonia.  Infectious etiology is not excluded
 given the correct clinical circumstance.  A lateral view if possible may be
 helpful for further characterization.
