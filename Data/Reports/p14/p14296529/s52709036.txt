                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:38.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is increase in interstitial markings bilaterally in a perihilar
 distribution as compared to earlier today, raising concern for mild
 interstitial edema.  The superior mediastinum, while prominent, is less
 prominent as compared to the prior study.  Cardiac silhouette is stable.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally
 suggests mild interstitial edema.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
