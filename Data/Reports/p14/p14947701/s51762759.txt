                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None Available.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe interstitial fibrosis with basilar predominance, accompanied by marked
 right middle and bilateral lower lobe volume loss.  Coexisting emphysema in
 the upper lobes is suspected.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is
 enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk compatible with central pulmonary
 hypertension.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity, likely represents atelectasis
 although infectious pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No focal lung
 consolidation seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe basilar predominant interstitial fibrosis, highly concerning for
 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and limiting evaluation for a superimposed acute
 process particularly at the bases.  Chest CT is recommended for more complete
 characterization.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 9:17 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
