                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures compatible with left long collapse.  Additionally, a
 lobulated contour of the right superior mediastinum and perihilar region
 suggests presence of mass lesions, potentially lymphadenopathy.  Right lung is
 clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures most compatible with collapse.  Abnormal right superior
 mediastinal and perihilar contour concerning for underlying mass lesions such
 as lymphadenopathy.  Further assessment with chest CT with contrast is
 recommended.
