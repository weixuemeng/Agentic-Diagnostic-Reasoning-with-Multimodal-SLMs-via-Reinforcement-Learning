 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // effusions, edema?     
 effusions, edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence
 of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary
 vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild blunting
 of the costophrenic angles suggests small effusions with bibasilar atelectatic
 changes.
