 INDICATION:  Patient status post assault.  Assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  No acute
 fracture is identified.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No acute fracture is noted.  In
 the setting of high clinical suspicion for a rib fracture, dedicated rib
 series may be obtained.
