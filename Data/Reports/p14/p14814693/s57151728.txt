                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is opacity in the left superior and posterior basal segments. There is
 associated volume loss of the left lower lobe.Heart size is within normal
 limits.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity in the superior and posterior basal segments with
 substantial volume loss.  Although potentially due to an acute infectious
 pneumonia with a component of atelectasis from mucous plugging, a post
 obstructive process from obstructing neoplasm such as carcinoid may have a
 similar radiographic appearance.  Depending on clinical presentation,
 short-term follow-up chest radiograph in 2 weeks after antibiotic therapy or
 immediate chest CT with contrast is recommended.  The latter would be
 suggested if the patient has been experiencing recurrent symptoms or if the
 process fails to substantially improved after treatment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Either short-term follow-up with chest radiograph in 2
 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy or chest CT with contrast is
 recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the ___ ___ at 5:00 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
