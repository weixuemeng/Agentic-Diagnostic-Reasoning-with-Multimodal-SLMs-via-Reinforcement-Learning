                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left leg pain and swelling, erythema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There are
 increased interstitial markings without frank evidence of consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but not changed given differences in
 positioning and technique.  Calcification projecting over the right lung apex
 could be due to calcification/scarring versus due to overlying vascular
 calcifications.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Mild interstitial edema and
 cardiomegaly.  No evidence of consolidation.
