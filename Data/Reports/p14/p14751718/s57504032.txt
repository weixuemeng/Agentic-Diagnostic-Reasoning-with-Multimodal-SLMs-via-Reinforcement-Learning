                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, diarrhea and headache.  Patient
 with HIV including very low CD4 count.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a vague opacity in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe
 immediately above the minor fissure with bronchial cuffing.  A similar finding
 is noted in the left upper lung but the latter may refer to the lingula since
 the lateral is suggestive of vague anterior opacity at that location.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague areas of increased interstitial prominence with
 peribronchial cuffing which may represent an early infectious process, perhaps
 referring primarily to airways, but including a relatively focal anterior
 opacity perhaps referring to the lingula.  Entities such as pneumocystis may
 be fairly occult in this context on radiography.  Follow-up radiographs are
 suggested.
