                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with AIDS and persistent neutropenia.  Evaluate
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are generally clear.  Mild left hilar enlargement is longstanding. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Though grossly this is a normal radiographic examination of the chest, subtle
 lung infection could be present and not apparent.  Chest CT scan is certainly
 more sensitive for detecting that as well as central lymph node enlargement.
