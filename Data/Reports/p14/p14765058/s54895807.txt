                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post renal transplant with cough, fevers and left lower lobe
 crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and likely dilated,
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is unremarkable.  Left lower lobe consolidative opacity appears
 relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam, and is compatible with
 pneumonia.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment are
 recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
