                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with a cough, history of recent pneumonia and
 past medical history of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no radiographic evidence of pneumonia currently.  There is a handful
 of very small lung opacities, which are difficult to characterize as either
 benign calcifications or soft tissue lung nodules.  Given the patient's severe
 hyperinflation due to COPD and increased lung cancer risk, it would be
 reasonable to propose a chest CT.
 
 Heart is borderline enlarged, given the extent of severe hyperinflation. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is prominent, but I see no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion.
