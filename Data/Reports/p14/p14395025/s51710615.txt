                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypercapneic resp failure s/p intubation  //
 Eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating
 approximately 6.2 cm above the level of the carina.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  There has been interval development of patchy opacity at the
 left lung base which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration, giving
 short-term interval. Patchy lateral right apical opacity is again seen, more
 prominent as compared to chest radiograph from ___, and while could
 theoretically be related to scarring, given patient is underlying emphysema
 and COPD and again, nonemergent chest CT recommended to further assess.  Right
 infrahilar opacity may relate to confluence of vascular structures although
 consolidation underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded. Slight blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle.  Mediastinal contours are stable. Hilar contours are
 stable. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.2 cm above the Carina.
 
 Interval development of patchy left basilar opacity, may be due to atelectasis
 or aspiration given short-term interval.
 
 Patchy lateral right apical opacity again seen, more prominent as compared to
 chest radiograph from ___, and while could theoretically be related
 to scarring, given patient is underlying emphysema and COPD and again,
 nonemergent chest CT recommended to further assess. Right infrahilar opacity
 may relate to confluence of vascular structures although consolidation or
 underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded.
