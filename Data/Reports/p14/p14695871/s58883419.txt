                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with increased bilateral edema, status post
 fall, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal size.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 There is interval development of mild pulmonary interstitial edema and
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Increased
 opacification at the right base could represent asymmetric edema; however,
 pneumonia will have a similar appearance.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development of mild pulmonary interstitial edema and moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Heterogeneous airspace opacification at the right base likely represents
 asymmetric edema and atelectasis, pneumonia not excluded. Follow up
 radiographs after the resolution of edema would be helpful.
