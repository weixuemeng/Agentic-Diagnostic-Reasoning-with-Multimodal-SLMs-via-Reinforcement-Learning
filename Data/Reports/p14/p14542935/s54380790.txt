 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:34 AM
  No definite pleural effusion based on a single supine portable film.  
  Consider lateral view for more detailed evaluation if desired. Mild pulmonary
  edema. Decreased retrocardiac opacity with new right lower lobe opacity which
  could be atelectasis.  Differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate
  clinical setting.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 9:17 AM
  1. Persistent retrocardiac opacity with new right lower lobe opacity and
  stable moderate left pleural effusion is most consistent with asymmetric
  pulmonary edema and atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia in the
  appropriate clinical setting.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 9:20 AM
  1.  Decreased retrocardiac opacity with new right lower lobe opacity and
  decreased moderate left pleural effusion is most consistent with asymmetric
  pulmonary edema and atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia in the
  appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion.  Assess pleural
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___, ___
 CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and increased
 interstitial markings suggesting component of mild pulmonary edema.  Interval
 increase in right lower lobe opacity.  Assessing for interval change of prior
 left effusions is difficult based on this single portable supine film.  No
 visualized pneumothorax.  Leftward deviation of the trachea is stable
 consistent with known multinodular goiter.  Previously identified fiducial
 seed in the right hilus is not seen on today's examination.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pleural effusion based on a single supine portable film.  Consider
 lateral view for more detailed evaluation if desired. Mild pulmonary edema.
 Decreased retrocardiac opacity with new right lower lobe opacity which could
 be atelectasis.  Differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
