                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with syncope  // eval for infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema is new from prior.  There is
 persistent moderate left pleural effusion with probable compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis.  A tiny right effusion is also likely present, unchanged from
 prior.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears prominent
 likely due to technique and an unfolded thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary congestion and edema with left greater than right pleural effusions
 and left basal consolidation likely atelectasis though difficult to exclude
 pneumonia.
