                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lateral view is limited
 secondary to significant respiratory motion.  On the frontal, there are
 bibasilar opacities, right greater than left potentially due to atelectasis
 given relatively low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.
 Descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, potentially atelectasis, although infection
 is not excluded.  Mild cardiomegaly.
