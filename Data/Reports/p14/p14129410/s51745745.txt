                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  There is obscuration of
 the right hemidiaphragm which may be due to consolidation, subpulmonic
 effusion.  Again seen in the right upper lung is hyperlucency likely related
 to emphysematous change.  Right upper paramediastinal opacity/scarring is
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower hemithorax opacity which may be due to pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis, possible underlying consolidation, and
 subpulmonic effusion.  There is mild interstitial edema.  Right
 paramediastinal opacity and right apical hyperlucency potentially related to
 emphysema are again seen without significant interval change.
