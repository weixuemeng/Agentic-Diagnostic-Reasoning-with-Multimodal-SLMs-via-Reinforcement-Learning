 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG/AVR  // interval change in effusion,
 volume change      interval change in effusion, volume change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:09

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pacer and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter unchanged in
 position in this patient status post median sternotomy with mitral annular
 ring and CABG and stable expected postoperative appearance to the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Interval improvement in
 mild pulmonary edema with crowding of the perihilar vasculature due to
 diminished lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.
