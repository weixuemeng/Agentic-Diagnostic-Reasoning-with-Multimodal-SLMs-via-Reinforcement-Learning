                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New AFib.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  There is right middle lobe atelectasis/scarring.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is seen.  There are patchy areas of opacity projecting over the
 right middle lobe and to a lesser extent, right upper lung.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 The aorta, mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Alternatively, it could be due to aspiration.  Additional subtle areas of
 opacity over the right upper lobe could be chronic changes or additional site
 of infection/aspiration.
