                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lateral chest pain after fall.  Question pneumothorax or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There are no focal opacities
 concerning for infection.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is present, however,
 but this clears upon deeper inspiration in the lateral films.  Cardiac size is
 normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  No rib fractures are appreciated on these
 non-dedicated films. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No evidence of fracture; however, chest x-ray is insensitive and dedicated
 rib views can be obtained if clinically desired.
