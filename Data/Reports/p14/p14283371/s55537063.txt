                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right upper lobectomy for NSCLC.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post a right upper lobectomy, with interval removal of a
 right apical chest tube.  A  small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. A
 widened right paratracheal stripe is noted, decreased in size since ___,
 and likely represents a postoperative collection or hematoma. There has been
 minimal improvement in the patient's mild right pulmonary edema, and a small
 right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Redemonstrated is a band of atelectasis
 in the mid left lobe.  The remainder of the left lung is essentially clear
 without evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax following the removal of a right
 apical chest tube. 
 
 2.  Stable, small right pleural effusion and improving right lung opacities
 status post right upper lobectomy. 
 
 3.  Interval decrease in the degree of right paratracheal widening.
