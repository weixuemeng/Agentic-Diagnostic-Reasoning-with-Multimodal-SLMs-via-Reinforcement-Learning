 HISTORY:  Lung cancer and HIV, now with recent right-sided VATS and lymph node
 biopsy.  Converted to right upper lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:   A very small right apical pneumothorax appears unchanged. 
 Plate-like atelectasis is again present in the left mid lung.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated with blunting of the right costophrenic angle in
 association with volume loss in the setting of right upper lobectomy.  There
 is probably a small pleural effusion.  Lobular thickening of the right
 paramediastinal stripe appears unchanged.
