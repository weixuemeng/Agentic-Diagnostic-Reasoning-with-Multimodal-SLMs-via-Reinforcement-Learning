                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ PET-CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post right upper lobectomy with expected right-sided volume
 loss and rightward shift of mediastinal structures noted. Right apical
 opacification corresponds to known extrapulmonary disease extension as seen on
 the prior PET-CT. Right hilar fullness corresponding to a known mass appears
 relatively unchanged. Left lung is clear. The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are similar. There is no pulmonary edema, new focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical opacity corresponds to known extrapulmonary disease extension as
 seen on the prior PET-CT.  Unchanged fullness of the right hilum corresponding
 to known mass. No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia and no
 pneumothorax identified.
