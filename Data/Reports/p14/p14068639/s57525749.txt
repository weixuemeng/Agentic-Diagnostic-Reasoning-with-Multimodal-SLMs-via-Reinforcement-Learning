                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration, as before.  The cardiac, mediastinal contours appear stable. 
 The lung volumes are low.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases are most
 consistent with minor atelectasis.  There is a mildly prominent appearance of
 upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature with instinct contours and
 peribronchial cuffing suggesting mild vascular congestion including ___ B
 lines at the lung bases.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
