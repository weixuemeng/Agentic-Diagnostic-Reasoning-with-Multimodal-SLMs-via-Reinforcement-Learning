                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker/ICD device terminates in the right
 ventricle.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable
 including a left ventricular configuration to the heart.  The lung volumes are
 low.  Minor streaky opacities at the lung bases suggest minor associated
 atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the left upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  No significant change.
