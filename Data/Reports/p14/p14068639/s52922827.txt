                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Swan-Ganz positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 17:55.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ-approach Swan-Ganz catheter again terminates deep within a right
 pulmonary artery.  A previously seen loop within the right ventricle has been
 resolved. There remains a smaller loop, likely coiled within the main
 pulmonary artery. A left-sided intracardiac device is unchanged in position. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A left retrocardiac opacity is minimally changed,
 likely reflecting atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter again terminates deep within a right pulmonary artery. A
 ventricular loop has been resolved. There remains a smaller loop likely within
 the main pulmonary artery.
