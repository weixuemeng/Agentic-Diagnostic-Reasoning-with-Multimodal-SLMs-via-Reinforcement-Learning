                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest
 demonstrates slightly low lung volumes.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged since
 the prior examination, with mild to moderate cardiomegaly and slight unfolding
 of the aorta again noted.  Increased right paramediastinal density immediately
 below the right clavicular head likely represents artifact due to  patient
 obliquity.
 
 No CHF.    There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Equivocal
 tiny right sided effusion.  No obvious focal infiltrate and no focal
 consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumonia.  Doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny right effusion. 
 Probable artifact in the right paramediastinal region due to patient
 obliquity.  If clinically indicated, PA and lateral views of the chest could
 help for further assessment.
