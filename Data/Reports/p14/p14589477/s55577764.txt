                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever, slightly productive cough
 and decreased oxygen saturation.  Evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size is unchanged at the upper limit
 of normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormality is present. 
 Unchanged appearance of the normal appearance of the thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. 
 No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures again demonstrate a
 previously demonstrated diffuse demineralization of the vertebral bodies in
 the thoracic spine with a mild degree of compression fracture at the level T12
 and L2.  These changes appear unaltered when comparison is made on the lateral
 views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of new acute infiltrates.
