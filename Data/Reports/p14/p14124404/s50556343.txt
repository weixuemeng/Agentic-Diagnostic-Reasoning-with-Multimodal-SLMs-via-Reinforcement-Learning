                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dysphagia s/p PEG tube with cough and
 elevated WBC count  // Assess for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable substantial cardiac enlargement without pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is interval improved pulmonary edema and resolution of patchy right
 basilar infiltrate with focal linear area of left-sided retrocardiac
 opacification.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  Mediastinal contours
 are stable from previous examination.  Continuous lucency under the diaphragm
 is consistent with pneumoperitoneum secondary to PEG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular congestion.  This
 discordance suggests the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial
 effusion.
 2. Left retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis although
 superinfection cannot be excluded especially in the absence of a lateral view.
