                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a left pneumothorax status post pigtail
 placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated through ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The small left apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent without signs of
 tension.  A left basal pigtail pleural drain reaches the midline, unchanged. 
 Greater opacification in the left lower lobe reflects decreasing aeration
 because of atelectasis, affects of contusion,  even early pneumonia.  The
 aneurysmal ascending aorta (CT, ___) explains the prominent right
 lateral bulge of the supracardiac mediastinum.  A hollow viscus in the left
 upper quadrant distended with non solid contents could be stomach or splenic
 flexure.  Unchanged left rib fractures, again identified.
 
  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsened left lower lobe atelectasis, delayed contusion, or early pneumonia. 
 Close follow up advised.  
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax appears newly apparent. 
  
 Unchanged left rib fractures, again identified.
