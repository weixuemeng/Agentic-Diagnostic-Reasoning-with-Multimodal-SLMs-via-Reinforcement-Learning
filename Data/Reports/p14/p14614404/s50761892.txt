                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post VATS decortication.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 14:27.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 8:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Left chest tube remains in place with no significant interval change in
 appearance of the left hemithorax where there is persistent patchy and linear
 opacity at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis and/or scarring.
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent chronic pleural
 thickening or a small effusion.  Several left-sided rib fractures and left
 scapular fracture are again seen. Improved aeration at the right lung base. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
