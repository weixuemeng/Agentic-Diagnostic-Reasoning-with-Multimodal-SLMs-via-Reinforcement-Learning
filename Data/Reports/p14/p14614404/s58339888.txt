                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pneumothorax
 after left pigtail placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates substantial interval decrease of left
 pneumothorax with only minimal apical pneumothorax seen.  Rib fractures on the
 left are redemonstrated as well as substantial scapular fracture, although
 partially imaged on the current examination.  Left basal opacity is still
 persistent, consistent with re-expanding lung.  Right basal opacity is
 redemonstrated.
