                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:30
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post decortication of the hemothorax
 with removal of final chest tube, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 8:34.
 
 Upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at 12:30
 p.m.  The lateral view is obscured by the patient's arm being at his side.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the left chest tube.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Streaky patchy opacity at both bases is seen, likely representing atelectasis
 given interval reduction in lung volumes.  A more linear opacity at the left
 base likely represents subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Left-sided rib fractures and the left scapular
 fracture are again identified.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in positioning.  Blunting of both costophrenic
 angles on the lateral projection suggest small effusions or pleural
 thickening.
