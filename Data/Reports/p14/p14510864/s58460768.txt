                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with subarachnoid
 hemorrhage after fall.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is difficult to assess due to bibasal opacities.  Although they
 most likely represent fat pad, infectious process or atelectasis cannot be
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Upper lungs are
 essentially clear.  Repeated radiograph in 24 hours is recommended.
