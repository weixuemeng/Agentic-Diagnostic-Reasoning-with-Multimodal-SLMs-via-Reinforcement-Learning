                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nodule versus nipple shadow.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, oblique views with nipple markers
 show that the previously described opacification does not appear to be a
 parenchymal process and therefore represents a nipple shadow.  Otherwise,
 little change.
