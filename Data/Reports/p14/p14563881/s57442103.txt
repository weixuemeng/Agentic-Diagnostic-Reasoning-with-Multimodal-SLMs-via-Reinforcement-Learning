                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval removal of a right
 internal jugular central venous line.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact. 
 Mediastinal clips are again noted.  A previously described tiny left apical
 pneumothorax is not evident on the current examination.  There are stable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Overall, aeration of the left lung base
 appears improved suggesting decreasing atelectasis.  Increased opacity in the
 left upper lobe is likely due to atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions with improved aeration of the
 left lung base.
 2.  Probable left upper lobe atelectasis
 3.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion without overt interstitial edema.
