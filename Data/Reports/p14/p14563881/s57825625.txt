                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assault with traumatic head bleed.  Assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray from three hours prior.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is top normal in size, but with a prominent left atrial
 contour.  The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, which could reflect chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Biapical pleural scarring is seen without
 focal consolidation.  Post-CABG changes are noted.  No displaced rib fractures
 are identified.
