 HISTORY:  CABG.  Left apical pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax has not increased over the past several days. 
 Lateral view shows that there is a small anterior loculation of pleural air
 and fluid as well as small to moderate dependent bilateral pleural effusion
 stable since ___.  Post-operative cardiomediastinal silhouette has been
 unremarkable and unchanged.  The upper lungs are clear.  Consolidation in the
 left lower lobe is usually due to atelectasis.  Right jugular line ends in the
 mid to low SVC.  I see no pleural drains in place.
