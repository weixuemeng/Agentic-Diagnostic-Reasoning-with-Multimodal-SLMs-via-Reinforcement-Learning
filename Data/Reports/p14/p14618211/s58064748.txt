                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p L pop-dp bypass GSV  // assess OG
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and multiple priors.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right central venous line ends in the low SVC or right atrium.  An
 endotracheal tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  A vascular stent is in
 unchanged position projecting over the mediastinum and left upper chest. 
 Atelectasis and a small pleural effusion at the left lung base.  A new enteric
 tube courses below the level of the diaphragm and off the inferior aspect of
 the film.  A surgical drain which courses across the radiograph likely lies
 outside the patient.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is chronically widened, but
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of an enteric tube, which courses below the level of the
 hemidiaphragm and out of the field of view.
