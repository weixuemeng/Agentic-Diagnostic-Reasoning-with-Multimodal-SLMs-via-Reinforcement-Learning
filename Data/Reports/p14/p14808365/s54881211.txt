                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal tube adjustment.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 1, 2, and 8 hr prior on the
 same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the
 endotracheal tube, which remains within the right mainstem bronchus.  There is
 slightly improved aeration of the left hemithorax, though volume loss and
 leftward shift of the mediastinum is persistent. Right base consolidation has
 increased. This could be due to recent aspiration, or developing pneumonia The
 remainder of the exam is largely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent right mainstem intubation, with slightly improved aeration of
 the left hemithorax, although volume loss and leftward shift of the
 mediastinum is persistent.  At the time of this dictation, the tube had
 already been repositioned.
 2. Worsening right basal consolidation followed for possible aspiration
 pneumonia.
