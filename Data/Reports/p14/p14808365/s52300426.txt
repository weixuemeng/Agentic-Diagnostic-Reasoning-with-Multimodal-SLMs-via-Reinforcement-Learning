                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal tube repositioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 1, 2, 3, and 9 hr prior on
 the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the
 endotracheal tube, which still terminates to low, roughly at the carina an
 should be withdrawn 2-3 cm. There is improved aeration of the left lung, with
 persistent atelectasis. Right base consolidation is slightly more pronounced,
 concerning for developing pneumonia.  The remainder of the exam is similar
 appearance, with a right internal jugular catheter terminating in the mid to
 distal SVC, a stimulator device projecting over the left chest wall, and a
 nasoenteric tube extending beyond the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of
 the image.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Repositioned ET tube is still to low should be withdrawn 2-3 cm.  Improved
 aeration of the left lung, with persistent atelectasis.
 
 Likely right lower lobe pneumonia.
