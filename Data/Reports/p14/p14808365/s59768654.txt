                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right internal jugular line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular
 line, with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.  A device projecting over
 the left scapula may represent a nerve stimulator. Lung volumes are low, with
 bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, also
 likely related to low lung volumes. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular line terminating in the distal SVC.
 2. Low lung volumes, with prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bibasilar
 atelectasis. Superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
