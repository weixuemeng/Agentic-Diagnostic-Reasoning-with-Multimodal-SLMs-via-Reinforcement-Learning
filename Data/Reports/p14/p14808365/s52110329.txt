                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe acidosis, intubated in ICU with
 high peak pressures and high FiO2 requirement.  Evaluate for ET tube placement
 and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors with direct comparison made to study performed on
 the same day at 02:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Support and monitoring devices are in unchanged position with the endotracheal
 tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina in unchanged position. There has been
 worsening of opacity at the right lung base with slight rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Markedly interval progression of opacity at the right lung base which may
 represent a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although
 superimposed pneumonia/ aspiration is also possible in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
