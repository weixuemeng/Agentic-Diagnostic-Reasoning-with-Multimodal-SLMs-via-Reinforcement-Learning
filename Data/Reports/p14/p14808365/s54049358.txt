                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 1 hr prior on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 an endotracheal tube, with right mainstem intubation and mild atelectasis of
 the left lung. The right lung is clear. The nasoenteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. A right central line
 terminates in the mid SVC, likely unchanged in position compared to the recent
 chest radiograph, but now with improved lung volumes.  A device projecting
 over the left scapula may represent a nerve stimulator. Surgical clips in the
 right upper quadrant are likely related to prior cholecystectomy. Pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mainstem intubation, with mild left sided atelectasis.  Recommend
 retraction of the endotracheal tube by approximately 5 cm.  NG tube and right
 IJ central venous catheter positioned appropriately.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___
 ___ to Dr. ___ at the approximately 23:15 on ___, immediately
 upon discovery.
