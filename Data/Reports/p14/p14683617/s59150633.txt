                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ILD and w/new onset SOB.  // r/o pulmonary
 edema, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent and
 severity of the known bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating in the
 subpleural lung zones, with a focus of increased severity at the left lung
 bases. Given the short interval, the change is likely reflect pulmonary edema
 overlying pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis.  The lung volumes remain low.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.
