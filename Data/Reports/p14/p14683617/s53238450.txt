                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF.  // Comparison to previous
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  Very
 extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, additional
 consolidations in the retrocardiac lung zone.  The changes are likely
 reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and atelectasis, potentially
 combined to pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists.  No
 larger pleural effusions.
