                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, chest pain  // eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged,
 with mild cardiomegaly re- demonstrated. Diffuse interstitial opacities are
 again noted, compatible with known chronic interstitial lung disease. Crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures with mild cephalization and indistinctness
 of the pulmonary vascular markings suggest mild superimposed pulmonary edema.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities
 are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Little interval change compared to the prior exam with mild pulmonary edema
 superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease.
