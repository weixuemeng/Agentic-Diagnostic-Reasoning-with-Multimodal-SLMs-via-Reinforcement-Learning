                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, COPD, hemoptysis  // Pathology?
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. There is an increase in interstitial structures at
 both lung bases, left more than right, with peripheral distribution.  The
 changes are suggestive of mild fibrotic parenchymal pathology, rather than
 interstitial lung edema.  This is supported by the presence of small traction
 bronchiectasis in retrocardiac location. Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No
 pneumonia.
