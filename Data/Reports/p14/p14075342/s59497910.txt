  The endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina.
  
  There are multifocal patchy consolidations in the left lung, which may
  represent atelectasis, multifocal aspiration or pneumonia.
  
  There is a 1.1 cm density overlying the right lower lobe, likely representing
  the midpole, given location.  Consider repeating the radiograph with a nipple
  marker on a nonemergent basis to exclude underlying pathology.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated transfer  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina.  Heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There are multifocal patchy consolidations in the left
 lung, which may represent atelectasis, multifocal aspiration or pneumonia. 
 There is a 1.1 cm density overlying the right lower lobe, likely representing
 the nipple, given location.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  There are cholecystectomy clips.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina.
 
 There are multifocal patchy foci of consolidation in the left lung, which may
 represent multifocal aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 There is a 1.1 cm round opacity overlying the right lower lobe, likely
 representing the nipple shadow, given location.  When the patient's condition
 permits, recommend repeating the radiograph with a nipple marker on a
 nonemergent basis to exclude underlying pathology.
