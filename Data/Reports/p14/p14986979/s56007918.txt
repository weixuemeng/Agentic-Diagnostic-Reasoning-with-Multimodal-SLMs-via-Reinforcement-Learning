                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lower lung reticulation is similar to somewhat increased
 compared to prior radiographs from ___ but new since ___
 ___.  Central pulmonary arteries are again mildly prominent.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.  However, persistent
 pulmonary opacities in the lower lungs may indicate underlying interstitial
 disease, a possibility which could be considered clinically and with dedicated
 chest CT if needed, versus primarily scarring from a prior insult such as
 previous infection or effusion.
