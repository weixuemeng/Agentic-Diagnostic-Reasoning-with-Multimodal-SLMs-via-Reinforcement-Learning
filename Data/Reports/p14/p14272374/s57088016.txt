                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left rib pain s/p fall  // please eval for
 acute infectious process, fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There may be minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 displaced fracture is obvious, however, evaluation of the lateral ribs is
 suboptimal on this study.  If clinical concern for rib fracture is high,
 consider dedicated rib series or chest CT.
