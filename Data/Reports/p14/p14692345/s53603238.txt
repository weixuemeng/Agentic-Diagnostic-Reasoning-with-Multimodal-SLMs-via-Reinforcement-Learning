                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient has had a left-sided chest tube inserted.
 
 REPORT:  There is near 100% expansion of the left lung.  A tiny apical
 pneumothorax persists.  There is left mid zone high-attenuation material,
 which may conceivably represent contusion or hemorrhage, but may also be
 artifactual.  The mediastinal structures are returned to ___.  No
 additional findings of note.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Successful reexpansion status post chest tube insertion.
