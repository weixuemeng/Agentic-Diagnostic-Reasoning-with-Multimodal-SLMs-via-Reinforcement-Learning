                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain, felt to be
 related to known umbilical hernia.  Evaluate position of the nasogastric tube
 after repositioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 22:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph performed less than 1 hr ago, there has
 been no significant interval change in positioning of the nasogastric tube,
 which terminates in the distal stomach/ proximal duodenum.
 
 Bronchovascular markings are slightly accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although infection
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No substantial
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change in position of the nasogastric tube, which terminates in
 the distal stomach/proximal duodenum.
