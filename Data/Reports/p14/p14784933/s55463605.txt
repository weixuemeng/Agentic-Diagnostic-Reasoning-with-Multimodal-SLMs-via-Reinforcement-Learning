                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope and chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  There is a
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.  There is a large retrocardiac opacity
 which could in part reflect the tortuous thoracic aorta, though a hiatal
 hernia cannot be excluded.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  A calcific density is seen in the right shoulder
 inferior to the glenohumeral joint, of unclear etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Cardiomegaly, tortuous thoracic aorta, possible hiatal hernia.  No pneumonia
 or CHF.  Calcification inferior to the right glenohumeral joint, correlate for
 focal pain.
