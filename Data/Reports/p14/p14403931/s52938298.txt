                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lung bases
 are suboptimally assessed due to lordotic positioning.  The previously noted
 opacity in the right lower lobe is difficult to assess.  Consider dedicated PA
 and lateral views to assess further.  In addition, left lung base is poorly
 assessed.  The mid and upper lungs appear well aerated.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours appear stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal evaluation of the lower lungs which in this patient
 with recent right lower lobe pneumonia renders this exam incomplete. 
 Recommend dedicated PA and lateral views to more clearly the lung bases.
