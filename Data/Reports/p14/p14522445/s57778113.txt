 Rule out pneumonia or tuberculosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly exaggerated by a moderately severe pectus
 deformity is unchanged.  Small region of consolidation in the anterior lung
 seen on the lateral view behind the sternum could be a small region of
 pneumonia in the right middle lobe, even though the radiodensity of that
 region is exaggerated by the pectus deformity.  There may be a second region
 of peribronchial infiltration in the right upper lobe lateral to the upper
 pole of the hilus.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
