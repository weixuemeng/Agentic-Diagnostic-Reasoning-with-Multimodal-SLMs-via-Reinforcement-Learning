 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.

 aorta.  There is prominence and a slight indistinctness of the central
 pulmonary vasculature compatible with fluid overload without frank
 interstitial edema.  Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild fluid overload without frank interstitial edema.
