                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD and SOB.  Evaluate for pneumonia versus
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged but unchanged.  Diffuse perihilar
 opacities are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities
 could be part of the same process although developing consolidations are also
 possible.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and severe cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar opacifications
 may reflect the same process although developing consolidations are also
 possible.  Correlation with patient symptoms following dialysis is
 recommended.
