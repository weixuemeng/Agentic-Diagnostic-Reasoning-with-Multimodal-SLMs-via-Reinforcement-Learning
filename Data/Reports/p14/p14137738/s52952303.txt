 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, evaluation for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stent in the left subclavian region.  Normal lung volumes.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and
 mediastinal contours.  No evidence of pleural effusions.  Additional stents
 are seen in the right axillary region and, on the lateral radiograph, in the
 right upper extremity.
 
 Unusually high bone density, likely related to the patient's underlying renal
 disease.
