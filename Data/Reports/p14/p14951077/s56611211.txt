                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML s/p allo transplant with cough,
 congestion  // ? PNA      ? PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 The only change to suggest any acute intrathoracic infection is a subtle, and
 not necessarily genuine finding on the lateral film of mild peribronchial
 infiltration or wall thickening in the right lung projecting over the
 posterior margin of the cardiac silhouette down to the diaphragm.  CT scanning
 would be required for confirmation.  Elsewhere, lungs are clear or, in the
 case of biapical scarring, unchanged.  There is no adenopathy or pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is normal.
