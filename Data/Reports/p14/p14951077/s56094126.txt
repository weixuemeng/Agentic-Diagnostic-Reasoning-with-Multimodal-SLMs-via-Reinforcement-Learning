 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near
 the cavoatrial junction.  Stable biapical pleural changes and more focal areas
 of opacity in the right upper lobe are suggestive of prior granulomatous
 infection.  No new focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest acute
 pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
