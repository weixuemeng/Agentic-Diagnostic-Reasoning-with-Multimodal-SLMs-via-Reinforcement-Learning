                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with FLT3+ AML s/p allo MUD SCT (___) with early relapsed
 disease, s/p treatment with sorafenib, DLI and MUC1-inhibitor + decitabine in
 past, also with recent admissions for pseudomonas and recurrent VCRE
 infection, on chronic suppressive therapy, and recent admission for rising
 blasts and LFTs complicated by hemolysis and mucositis; now here with diarrhea
 and on labs from clinic seen to have hypokalemia and alkalosis as well as
 thrombocytopenia.  // Desat to 80s Desat to 80s
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.  Continued
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent
 with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Minimal
 atelectatic changes on the right.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
