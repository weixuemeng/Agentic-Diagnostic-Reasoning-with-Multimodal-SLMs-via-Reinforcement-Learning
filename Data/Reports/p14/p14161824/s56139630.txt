                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema in the setting of moderate-severe cardiomegaly. Opacification in the
 retrocardiac area is probably due to effusion, atelectasis, or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent effusion, atelectasis or pneumonia.
