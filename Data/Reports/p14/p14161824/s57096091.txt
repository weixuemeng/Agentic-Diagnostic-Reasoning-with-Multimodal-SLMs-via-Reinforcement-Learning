                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of CHF.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.

 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Leads of a left chest wall pacer
 terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Small right pleural
 effusion has slightly enlarged since the prior exam.  Left pleural effusion is
 similar to prior.  Bibasilar opacities remain consistent with atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to prior.  Cardiomegaly and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  An azygos lobe is incidentally noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right and stable left small pleural effusions with pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
