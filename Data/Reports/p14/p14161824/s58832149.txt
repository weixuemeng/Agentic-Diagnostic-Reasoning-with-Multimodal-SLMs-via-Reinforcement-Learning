 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:27 PM
  
  Post-surgical changes including ET Tube 2.0 cm from the carina (retraction by
  3.0 cm recommended), enteric tube coild superior to the diaphragm with the tip
  underneath the diaphragm suggesting a hiatal hernia (further advancement
  recommended), Ecmo catheter with the tip in the upper SVC. Dual lead pacemaker
  appears stable. Interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent
  atelectasis. There is however asymmetric pulmonary edema, severe on the right
  and mild to moderat on the left. Severe cardiomegaly again noted.
  
  These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ via telephone at

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of tubes and lines.
 
 
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph shows a postoperative condition with an endotracheal
 tube.  The tip projects 2 cm above the carina, pulling back by approximately
 1-2 cm is recommended.  Enteric tube is coiled superior to the diaphragm, with
 the tip underneath the diaphragm, suggesting the presence of a hiatal hernia. 
 An Ecmo catheter is seen with the tip in the upper SVC.  Dual-lead pacemaker
 is stable.  Moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema with stable bilateral pleural
 effusions and moderate cardiomegaly.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
