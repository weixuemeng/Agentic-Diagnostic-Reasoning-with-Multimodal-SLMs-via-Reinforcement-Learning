                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is relatively low, 2.3 cm above the carina and might be pulled
 back for about 1.5 cm.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  Slight interval increase in bibasilar, in
 particular left areas of atelectasis is demonstrated.
