                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall, on Plavix.  Question fracture or
 bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a small right lower lobe opacity.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are normal.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  No definite rib fractures are noted, although if this is of clinical
 concern, then a dedicated rib series is recommended.  A fracture of the left
 distal clavicle is of uncertain acuity.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small bilateral effusions.  No definite pneumothorax.
 
 2.  A fracture of the left distal clavicle is of indeterminate chronicity. 
 Correlation with site of pain is recommended.
