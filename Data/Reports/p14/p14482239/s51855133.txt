                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung nodules  // assess lung nodules
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subcentimeter calcified nodules in the right lower lung indicate prior
 granulomatous infection; some of the lesions could be in the right breast
 instead.  A 1.5 mm opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 view is concerning for a non-calcified pulmonary nodule.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible 1.5cm lower lobe lung mass, should be evaluated by Chest CT.
 
 Subcentimeter calcified nodules in the right lower lung, probably due to
 remote granulomatous infection; no evidence of active infection.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT
