                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Castleman's disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Comparison is also made to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is subtle opacity at the right costophrenic angle, which
 most likely relates to atelectasis and vascular structures, although early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.   
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the right costophrenic angle, which most likely
 relates to atelectasis and vascular structures, although early infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
