                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___ WITH MULTIPLE COMPARISON CHEST
 RADIOGRAPHS AND CT SCANS DATING BACK TO ___
 
 FINDINGS:  An incompletely marginated rounded opacity in the lingula has
 markedly increased in size since ___ from about 1.8 cm to 3.5 cm
 in diameter.  Its margins are smooth superiorly and medially, but remaining
 margins are incomplete.  The opacity is present since at least ___ CT torso, but is not evident on older chest ___ of ___. 
 Exam is otherwise similar in appearance to the previous radiograph of ___, with small nodular opacities in the right upper lobe, and linear
 scar versus atelectasis in the right mid and left lower lung regions. 
 However, minimal blunting of right costophrenic sulcus posteriorly is
 apparently new and could reflect a small effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  No acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly enlarging, mass-like opacity in the lingula is likely
 either infectious or inflammatory in etiology.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, infection such as Nocardia and fungal organisms should be considered.
 Localized form of organizing pneumonia is an additional consideration.
 
 Further evaluation with chest CT may be helpful for more complete
 characterization, particularly to evaluate for possible pleural component
 given incomplete margins.  Findings entered into radiology communications
 dashboard on ___.
