 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall with no particular chest wall tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from___ at 5:52.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous, with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob and unchanged
 dilatation of the ascending aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Apart from minimal atelectasis at the lung bases, the remainder of the lungs
 are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities identified including no displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No fracture identified.  If there is continued
 concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series is suggested.
