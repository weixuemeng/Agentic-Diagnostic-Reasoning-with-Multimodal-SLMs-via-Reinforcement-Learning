                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Castleman disease and
 pulmonary nodules.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 Left apical nodule is partially obscured by the intersection of left clavicle
 and first left rib and cannot be entirely assessed.  The left lower lung
 nodule appears to be increased in the craniocaudal dimension from 3.5 to 4.5
 cm.  Additional pulmonary nodules better appreciated on the CT chest can be
 barely seen on the chest radiograph, but for example, the left hilar lymph
 node appears to be unchanged, 8 mm.  For precise assessment of the dynamic
 changes of the nodules, chest CT should be considered at the appropriate time
 interval.  There is minimal amount of left pleural effusion.  The effusion has
 improved since ___ as well as there is improvement of bibasal
 lung atelectasis.
