                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Delirium, cough, recent fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with
 tortuosity of thoracic aorta again demonstrated. Diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcification of the thoracic aorta is also present. There are diffusely
 increased interstitial markings suggestive of underlying chronic lung disease.
 Calcified granuloma within the right mid lung field is unchanged.  No pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is present.  A mild compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body likely was present on the prior
 study though no lateral view was obtained.  The lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Mild compression deformity
 of a mid thoracic vertebral body, likely unchanged compared to the prior study
 though no lateral view was obtained at that time.
