 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion and elevated lactate.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is new, but mild diffuse interstitial abnormality, which
 most often would likely signify pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left basilar
 opacity suggests atelectasis or scarring.  The aorta is extensively calcified.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild rightward convex
 curvature and bony demineralization with a lower thoracic compression
 deformity that appears not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild interstitial abnormality, probably due to pulmonary
 congestion, although in the appropriate clinical setting other etiologies such
 as atypical pneumonia could be considered.
