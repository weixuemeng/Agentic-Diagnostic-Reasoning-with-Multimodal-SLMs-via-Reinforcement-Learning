                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SCC, recent fem port placement  // r/o ptx
 r/o ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right femoral catheter is
 not definitely seen, though it could be in the IVC just beneath the
 hemidiaphragms. Repeat radiograph with abdominal technique and upper border at
 the hilum could be obtained.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, raising the possibility of its
 left effusion and mild atelectatic changes.  Otherwise, little overall change
 in appearance of the heart and lungs except for some decrease in pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
