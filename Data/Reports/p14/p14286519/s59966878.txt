                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable chronic heart failure or pneumonia, resolved over
 the last three weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  There is a status post sternotomy, the alignment of the sternal
 wires are unchanged.  The left internal jugular vein catheter has been
 removed.
 
 There is substantial patient rotation with asymmetry in radiodensity of the
 hemithoraces.  Along the minor fissure on the right, a focal area of fissural
 thickening is seen.  The right hilus is slightly larger and more dense than on
 the left, which, however, can be attributed to patient rotation.
 
 Neither the frontal nor the lateral radiographs show acute lung changes, no
 pleural effusions, no pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
