                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia, evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates vascular congestion
 and cardiomegaly.  An opacity at the left lung base may represent atelectasis,
 however, pneumonia should not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Aortic arch calcifications, sternotomy wires and CABG ___ are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Left base opacity may be atelectasis,
 however, pneumonia should be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Post-diuresis films would be of utility in excluding underlying infection.
