                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent surgery, now with post-op fever, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are a few opacities in the left lung base with increased
 density over the lower thoracic spine on the corresponding lateral view, which
 appear slightly linear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are also within normal limits.  A right
 healed rib fracture is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis
 although early developing pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
