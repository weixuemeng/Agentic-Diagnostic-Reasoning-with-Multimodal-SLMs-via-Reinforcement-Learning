                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with evidence of prior esophagectomy and gastric pull-through. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aortic arch are re- demonstrated. 
 Ill-defined patchy opacities are noted involving the right mid and lower lung
 fields as well as to a lesser extent within the left lung base, findings which
 are suspicious for aspiration pneumonia.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly on the lateral view suggests small bilateral pleural effusions,
 new in the interval.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal ill-defined patchy opacities involving the right mid lung field and
 both lung bases concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  New small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
