                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed  
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Previously demonstrated multifocal
 consolidations have resolved.  Small amount of pleural effusion is present. 
 Right lower lung pulmonary nodule appears to be slightly increased as compared
 to the prior study and might potentially be further assessed with a chest CT. 
 No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Scarring in the right upper lobe is noted.
