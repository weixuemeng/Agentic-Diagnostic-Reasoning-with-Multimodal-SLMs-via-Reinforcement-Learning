 ___, ___, and ___.

 bilateral lung bases, concerning for aspiration.  Chronic medial right apex
 pleural thickening and triangular peripheral interstital opacities in the
 right mid lung field are again seen.  A hazy opacity consistent with chronic
 scarring related to radiation treatment is again seen in the medial right
 upper lobe.  An 8 mm nodular opacity is again seen within the right lower
 lobe, unchanged from prior exam.  There is atelectasis at the left lung base.

 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, concerning for aspiration
