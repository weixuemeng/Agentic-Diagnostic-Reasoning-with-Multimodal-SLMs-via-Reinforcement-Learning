                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea and cough  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of consolidation.  Linear opacity in the
 right mid to upper lung is compatible with scarring as well as changes of the
 posterior right ribs which are chronic.  Blunting of the right lateral
 posterior costophrenic angle is chronic, potentially due to scarring or trace
 effusion.  Blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle suggests small
 pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 Prominent retrocardiac opacity on the right is compatible with a neo
 esophagus.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New trace left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
