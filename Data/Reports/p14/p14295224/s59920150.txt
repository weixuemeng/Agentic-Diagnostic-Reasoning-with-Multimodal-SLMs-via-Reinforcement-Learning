                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Painful right-sided chest pain and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The patient is status post
 esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  Chronic scarring within the medial
 aspect of the right upper lobe is compatible with post radiation changes. 
 Tenting of the right hemidiaphragm is compatible chronic volume loss in the
 right lung. Worsening opacification within the right upper lobe is concerning
 for recurrent pneumonia or aspiration.  8 mm nodular opacity within the right
 lower lobe is unchanged.  The left lung is clear.   Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is chronic, and likely reflects a chronic small pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening opacification within the right upper lobe which is concerning for
 recurrent pneumonia or aspiration.  Follow up radiographs are recommended
 after treatment to ensure resolution of this finding.  
 
 2. Status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with right upper lobe
 medial scarring related to prior radiation treatment.
 
 3. Unchanged 8 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
