                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of cardiac amyloidosis, presenting with concern
 for delirium.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged which may be due to cardiomyopathy given patient
 history more likely than pericardial effusion.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is
 calcified.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Some degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette presumed from cardiomyopathy given patient's
 history, less likely pericardial effusion.
