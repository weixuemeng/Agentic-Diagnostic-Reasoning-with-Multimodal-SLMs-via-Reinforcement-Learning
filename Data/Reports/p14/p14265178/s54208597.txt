                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and history of congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains calcified, with
 the mediastinal and hilar contours appearing otherwise unremarkable.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Lungs are clear.  Hyperinflation of lungs
 with flattening of the diaphragms suggests COPD.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Clips are seen within the upper abdomen.  Widening of the
 left acromioclavicular joint suggest prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Hyperinflation of lungs suggestive of
 COPD.
