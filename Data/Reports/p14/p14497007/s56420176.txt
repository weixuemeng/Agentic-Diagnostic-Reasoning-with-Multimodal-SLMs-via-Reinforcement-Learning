 well expanded.  A masslike opacity seen on the same day lumbar spine CT is not
 appreciated on this examination.  There is probably a trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Spinal fusion hardware is grossly unremarkable.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.
 2. A masslike opacity seen on the same day lumbar spine CT is not appreciated
 on this examination.  Recommend dedicated chest CT for further evaluation.
