                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough and coarse breath sounds, assess for pneumonia.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Aside from minimal linear bibasilar atelectasis, the
 lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Extensive spinal hardware is incompletely
 imaged.
