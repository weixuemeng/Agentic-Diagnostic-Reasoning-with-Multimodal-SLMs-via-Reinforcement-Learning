 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is a large left-sided pleural effusion with significant adjacent
 atelectasis and partial left lower lobe collapse.  There is no right-sided
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The upper lung fields are
 grossly clear bilaterally.  No appreciable mediastinal shift is identified. 
 The cardiac size is difficult to measure accurately given the obscuration of
 the left heart border by the large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially unchanged appearance of a large left pleural effusion with
 significant adjacent atelectasis.
