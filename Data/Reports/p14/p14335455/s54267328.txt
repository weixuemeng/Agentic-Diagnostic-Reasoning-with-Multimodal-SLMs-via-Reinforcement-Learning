                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post total colectomy, now with increased
 WBC count and crackles, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Tip of left PICC
 now terminates in the axilla. Deviation of the trachea to the right raises
 possibility of a thyroid mass. Lung volumes are significantly reduced but
 unchanged compared to prior.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette is in part due to a
 combination of low lung volumes and technique.  Opacification seen at the
 right base is likely caused by a combination of low lung volumes, atelectasis,
 and possibly a small pleural effusion, superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
 Free air under the diaphragm is again noted in this postoperative patient.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant changes compared to the prior study.  Basilar opacification
 likely represents atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical context
 pneumonia is also possible.
 2.  Deviation of the trachea to the right raises the possibility of a thyroid
 mass.
 3.  Left PICC has been withdrawn and tip now ends in the axilla.
