                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post right-sided iliac aneurysm
 and fem-fem bypass performed on ___.  Now with fever.  Assess for
 pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Cardiac
 enlargement as before.  Unchanged position of previously described permanent
 right-sided pacer with dual intracavitary electrode system, unchanged. 
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion as before.  Diffuse haze over the lung
 bases, slightly less marked as before but probably related to changes in
 patient's position.  No conclusive evidence of new discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates on this portable chest examination.  Status post
 sternotomy as before.  Extensive calcifications seen in the wall of the aorta
 at the level of the arch.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Change of appearance of bilateral pleural effusions related to
 minor changes in patient's position.  No conclusive evidence of new acute
 pulmonary infiltrates.  If such diagnosis is essential, recommend additional
 lateral view as basal lung  spaces are obscured by pleural effusions.
