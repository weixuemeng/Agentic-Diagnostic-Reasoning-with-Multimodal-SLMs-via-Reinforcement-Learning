                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  White blood cell count elevation and cough.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable single AP exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal. There is a new, large area of focal
 consolidation overlying the right upper lung, as well as patchy opacities in
 the lung bases bilaterally, right greater than left. There is a small right
 pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Large new focal consolidation in the right upper lobe as well as
 patchy opacities in the lung bases bilaterally, right greater than left. While
 this could be secondary to multifocal pneumonia, a right upper lobe mass
 cannot be excluded on this study and CT can be considered for further
 assessment.
