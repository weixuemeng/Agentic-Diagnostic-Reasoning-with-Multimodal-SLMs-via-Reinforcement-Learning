                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating clear
 well expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Slight prominence of the pulmonary hila is noted which could represent
 crowding of bronchovasculature.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Slight prominence of pulmonary
 hila likely reflects crowding of bronchovasculature.
