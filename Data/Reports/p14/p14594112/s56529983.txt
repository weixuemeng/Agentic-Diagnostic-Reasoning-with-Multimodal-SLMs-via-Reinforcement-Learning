                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with AMS  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Better seen on the
 lateral view there is a rounded density which is most likely secondary to
 hypertrophic changes of the costovertebral junction projecting over the lower
 thoracic spine, given continuity with the associated rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
