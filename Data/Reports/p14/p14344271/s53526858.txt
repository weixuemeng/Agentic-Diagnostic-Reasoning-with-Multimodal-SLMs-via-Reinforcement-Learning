                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with white count.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single AP image was reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are
 well expanded and clear. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The
 gas collection projecting over the upper esophagus, present since ___ is
 either a Zenkers diverticulum or distension of the upper esophagus; contrast
 esophagram should be considered to see if this is clinically significant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Either chronic Zenkers
 diverticulum or distension of the upper esophagus couild be further evaluated
 with contrast esophagram. 
 Conventional chest radiographs are not adequate to evaluate the chest cage. If
 there are focal findings of clinically significant trauma, they should be
 marked, and detail views should be requested.
