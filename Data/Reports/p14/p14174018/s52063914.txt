                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  please evaluate ET tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is too low touching the carina.  It should be pulled back at least 2.5
 cm.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Increased density in lower lung could
 be due to increased layering pleural effusion and slightly increase in
 atelectasis, mostly in left lower lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right
 jugular line has been removed.  Left jugular line ends at the junction of
 superior vena cava in brachiocephalic vein.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Prior
 sternotomy was done for CABG.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 ET tube is too low touching the carina and should be pulled back at least 2.5
 cm.  This was discussed with the medical team and by the time they were
 reached, the ET tube has already been pulled back.
