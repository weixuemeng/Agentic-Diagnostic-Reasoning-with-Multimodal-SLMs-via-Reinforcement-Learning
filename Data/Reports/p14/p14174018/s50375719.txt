                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastrointestinal bleed, evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The new nasogastric tube is in correct position, with its tip in
 the stomach.  The right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.  Low lung
 volumes with signs of mild fluid overload and retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus could suggest the presence of a small
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
