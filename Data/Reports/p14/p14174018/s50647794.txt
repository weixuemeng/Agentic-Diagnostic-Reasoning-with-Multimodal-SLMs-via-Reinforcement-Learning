                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ pound weight loss, poor oral intake and failure to thrive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant priors.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged with left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are within limits.  Mild interstitial
 abnormality is demonstrated within the lung bases with a peripheral
 distribution, suggestive of chronic changes.  Streaky opacity in the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable left basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
