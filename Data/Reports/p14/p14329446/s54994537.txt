                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated with LLL opacity  // interval change   
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric
 tubes have been removed.  There has been the development of substantial
 opacification at the bases with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms. This is
 consistent with layering pleural effusions and underlying compressive
 atelectasis, more prominent on the right.  Engorgement of central vessels is
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion, though the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits in size.
