                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy ill-defined opacities within the lung bases could reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  A
 trace right pleural effusion may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which limits assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy
 ill-defined opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration are also a consideration.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
