                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Repeat presentation to the emergency department with new chest pain,
 shortness of breath, unable to take full breath.  Evaluate for acute process
 including pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes continue to accentuate the mediastinal and hilar contours. 
 Prominence of the bilateral hila could represent underlying adenopathy as also
 mentioned on the prior study, although may be slightly less prominent on this
 study than on the prior.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Prominence of the hila could represent
 adenopathy, which can be assessed with non-urgent CT.
