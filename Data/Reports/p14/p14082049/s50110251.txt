                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with a pacemaker who presented after a fall requires
 chest radiograph to assess pacemaker
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is slightly limited by lordotic positioning.  Right-sided pacer device
 is noted with leads in unchanged positions, terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  Marked
 narrowing of the right acromiohumeral interval is compatible with underlying
 rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Pacing leads remain intact and in
 unchanged positions.
