                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chf, pna  // eval for interval changes     
 .  Prior study indicates status post T and B are
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.
 Right IJ sheath is now present instead of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, possibly slightly more
 prominent.  Sternotomy wires are noted. As before, the upper most sternotomy
 wire is interrupted.  The patient's T AVR is noted.
 
 Diffuse opacities, right-greater-than-left are again visible.  These are
 probably similar to prior.  There is slightly increased prominence on the
 left, which may be accounted for by differences in technique.  These are
 non-specific, but as previously described, compatible with pulmonary edema. In
 the appropriate clinical setting, the differential could include pneumonic
 infiltrates.
 
 No gross effusion is detected on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of ET and NG tube and exchange to a right IJ sheath.
 
 Possible interval increase in cardiac silhouette.  T AVR noted.  Interrupted
 sternal wire again noted.
 
 Diffuse opacities, more pronounced on the right, similar to prior.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting this could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema
 or pulmonary infiltrates.  No gross effusions detected.
