 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, bibasilar crackled  // Pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are again noted.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.
 There are diffuse pulmonary airspace opacities right greater than left,
 concerning for pulmonary edema, though difficult to exclude a superimposed
 pneumonia.  No large effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour
 is grossly unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  The superior most
 sternotomy wire appears fragmented as on prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with severe pulmonary edema.  Difficult to exclude a
 component of pneumonia.
