                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, HFpEF and severe MR ___/p TMVR, with
 persistent fevers and pulmonary infiltrates  // interval exam
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 08:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the radiographic appearance is quite
 similar.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and T AVR.  Also again seen
 is diffuse opacity throughout the right lung, probably alveolar, with
 scattered air bronchograms, and less pronounced opacity in the left lung, with
 a combination of vascular plethora and probable areas of alveolar opacity
 including scattered retrocardiac air bronchograms.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, probably unchanged.
 
 Diffuse right greater the left opacities are similar to the prior film.  As
 before, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or alternatively infectious infiltrates or ARDS.  Other
 etiologies for alveolar opacities are not excluded.
 
 Note is made that the appearance of the lungs has been relatively similar
 since at least ___, also the date of the patient's most recent
 chest CT.
