                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever, pneumonia.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates
 stable severe cardiomegaly with increased hazy prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature with multifocal opacifications bilaterally, right greater than
 left.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  Findings may represent
 pulmonary edema, though infectious process is not excluded.  No pneumothorax
 evident.  Sternotomy sutures are midline.  Stable fracture of the first
 sternotomy suture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe cardiomegaly with background pulmonary edema. 
 Increased interstitial markings at right lung base may represent asymmetric
 edema versus developing infectious process.
