 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Severe COPD, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Marked overinflation and known scarring at both lung apices.  Mild
 right pleural thickening, caused by potential right rib fractures.  No
 evidence of recent pneumonia.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pleural effusions. However, a rounded dense approximately 1.5
 cm structure is still seen in the RUL. The structure was visualized on
 yesterday's film, but not several months ago. CT should be performed to
 excluded the potential presence of a malignancy.
