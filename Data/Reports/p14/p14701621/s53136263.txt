 HISTORY:  Low-grade fever.  History of HIV.  Increased cough.  History of COPD
 on home oxygen.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; a chest CT is also available
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Vague upper lung opacities known to reflect architectural irregularity
 associated with emphysema appear similar to the prior radiographs.  There has
 been no significant change.  The lungs appear hyperinflated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild loss in body heights among several mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies appears similar to the prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
