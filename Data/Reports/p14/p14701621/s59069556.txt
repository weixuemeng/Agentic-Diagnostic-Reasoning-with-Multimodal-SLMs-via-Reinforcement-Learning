                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, on mask, not improving, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 9:56 a.m.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning, with a respiratory mask overlying the upper
 portion of the thoracic inlet in the midline.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is new opacity at the left base -- ? focal
 infiltrate versus prominent atelectasis.  There is diffuse prominence of the
 vessels, but no clear CHF.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base,
 unchanged.  No gross effusion.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are
 present.  These seem to account for the focal opacities seen on the prior
 film.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Increased patchy opacity at the left lung base raising the question of a
 focal pneumonic infiltrate.  
 2) Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
