                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for interval change.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip lies approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. 
 Compared with the earlier film, the right IJ central line has been retracted. 
 The tip now lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 There is minimal patchy opacity at the left base, which is more pronounced
 than on the film from ___ at 18:44 p.m.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central line tip now in region of cavoatrial junction.
 
 2.  New patchy opacity left base.
