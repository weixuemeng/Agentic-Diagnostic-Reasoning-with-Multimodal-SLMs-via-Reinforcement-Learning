                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs is compatible with severe emphysema.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Indistinct right upper lobe opacity
 measuring approximately 1.8 cm is re- demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Deformity of the right left humeral head is likely
 posttraumatic in etiology.  Right lateral pleural thickening with old
 right-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Re- demonstration of indistinct right
 upper lobe opacity for which a chest CT is again recommended to exclude
 malignancy.
