                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, known severe COPD, question pneumonia or effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The patient is status post tracheostomy, new since the prior chest radiograph.
 There is severe COPD, with hyperinflation.  There is eventration of left
 greater than right hemidiaphragm with atelectasis at the left base.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No focal consolidation or
 effusion is identified.  Multiple old right rib fractures are present.  These
 may account for the vague nodular densities in the right mid zone laterally. 
 Incidental note is made of deformity of the left humeral head with a
 well-corticated fragment or loose body along the inferior edge of the left
 glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe COPD.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No
 obvious pneumonic infiltrate and no effusion.  Nodular densities along the
 right lung, ? artifact due to prior rib fractures.
