                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, worsening symptoms.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are hyperinflated with redemonstration of severe emphysema.
 There is a new focal opacification projecting over the right mid to upper
 lung, which may represent developing pneumonia, but assessment is limited due
 to patient rotation.  Evaluation of the right hilum is also similarly limited
 though overall the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear grossly
 unchanged. No pleural effusion present.  Deformity of the left humeral head is
 likely related to prior trauma.  Multiple stable thoracic compression
 deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Severe emphysema. 
 2) New focal opacification of right mid lung could represent pneumonia, though
 the patient is rotated on this exam. This could be reassessed with a repeat
 frontal radiograph.
 3) Deformity of the left humeral head, likely due to remote trauma. 
 4) Multiple stable thoracic compression deformities.
