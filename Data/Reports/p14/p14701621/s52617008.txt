                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with HIV, intubated, please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs with the most
 recent dated ___ as well as chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine portable radiograph demonstrates minimally improved
 aeration of the right upper lobe, though there appears to be increased opacity
 in the left lower lobe, possibly positional though cannot exclude worsening
 infectious process.  Stable evidence of volume loss on the left with left
 hemidiaphragm elevation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar borders are unremarkable.  Endotracheal tube is at
 the level of the carina.  There is a right-sided central venous catheter with
 tip in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Improved aeration of right upper lobe but with increased opacification and
 left lower lobe may be positional though cannot exclude increased atelectasis
 versus infectious process, possibly aspiration related.
 2. ET tube at the level of the carina. Should be withdrawn 2cm to be at level
 of clavicles.
