 Endotracheal tube tip is 3 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the
 field of view.  Bibasilar opacities are noted which could be due to any
 combination of consolidation, atelectasis or effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged likely accentuated by technique.  Calcifications are noted
 at the aortic arch.  Bilateral rib fractures are noted laterally. 
 Subcutaneous gas projects over the right chest wall.  There is probable right
 apical pneumothorax laterally.
