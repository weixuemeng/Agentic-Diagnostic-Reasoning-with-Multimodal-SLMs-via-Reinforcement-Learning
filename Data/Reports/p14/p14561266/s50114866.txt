  An endotracheal tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  Cardiomegaly is
  moderate.  Lung volumes are low and assessment left lung base is limited.  An
  opacity at the right lung base could represent aspiration or infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p PEA arrest and cooling protocol now desatting
 on the vent.  // Please assess for pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 2.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Right-sided chest tube is
 present.  Right subclavian central line tip lies in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is rotated positioning as well suspected right convex thoracic
 scoliosis.
 
 Allowing for this, there is probable mild cardiomegaly.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Probable small
 left effusion.
 
 Vascular markings are diffusely prominent, suggesting presence of CHF. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle without gross effusion.
 
 No frank consolidation is seen in the right lung.  Small amount of pleural
 fluid and/or thickening is seen at the left-greater-than-right lung apices.
 
 Assessment for rib fractures is quite limited on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and probable mild CHF.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Probable small left and
 possible small right effusions.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
