                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph AP and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with head strike, confusion.  Assess for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT cervical spine ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  Left lung is clear.  Heterogeneous
 right lower lobe opacity is only seen on frontal projection.  There is
 cardiomegaly.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced
 rib fractures identified.  There is mild inferior subluxation of the distal
 end of the left clavicle relative to the acromion.  Limited visualization of
 associated fractures on this single view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.  Within this limitation, there is
 minimal inferior subluxation of the distal end of the left clavicle relative
 to the adjacent acromion process.  Associated fractures are not clearly
 visualized on this single view and if there is focal bony tenderness in this
 region additional imaging by cross-sectional exams such as a CT is
 recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Please correlate with clinical exam findings to evaluate
 the left acromioclavicular joint.  If there is focal bony tenderness in this
 region further evaluation by cross-sectional exams such as a chest CT should
 be considered
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:13 AM, 5
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
