                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o sigmoid diverticulosis, HTN, DM, CKD,
 CABG s/p POD18 subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy w/ worsening back/abd
 pain.  // eval for mediastinal widening, effusions, PNM, edema     eval for
 mediastinal widening, effusions, PNM, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___, read
 in conjunction with imaging of the lower chest on an abdomen CT, ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion in the left lung has increased since ___,
 although there is no definite pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion on the left
 is small if any.  The heart is not enlarged.  Mediastinal veins are somewhat
 more distended consistent with volume overload.
 
 The appearance of the right lower hemi thorax is abnormal but the explanation
 is not entirely clear. The right lung base became appreciably more elevated
 between ___ and ___.  Abdomen CT on ___ showed that was due
 substantially to elevation of the diaphragm, ascites, and right middle lobe
 collapse.  Whether there is new right pleural effusion is radiographically
 indeterminate, and aeration in the right lung base is also in question.  If
 patient has respiratory insufficiency, CT scanning, with the use of
 intravenous contrast to highlight atelectasis, would be very useful.
 
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
