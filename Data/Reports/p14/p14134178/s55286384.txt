 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 11:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continue to be bilateral layering effusions with associated patchy
 airspace process most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Due to
 the pleural effusions, the cardiac contour is obscured and cannot be
 adequately assessed. Right internal jugular large bore catheter remains in
 place with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 minimal symmetric biapical pleural thickening. No pneumothorax is seen.
