                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with follicular lymphoma here for allo
 transplant (day -3). Now with new O2 requirement and fevers following ATG
 infusion  // Eval fluid overload vs ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are diminished, compared to the baseline of a hyper inflated
 chest.  Some of the explanation is any increase in moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions. There is also sufficient opacification at both lung bases to raise
 question of pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 larger today than on previous AP studies suggesting new cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion.
 
 Right internal jugular dual channel catheter ends low in the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
