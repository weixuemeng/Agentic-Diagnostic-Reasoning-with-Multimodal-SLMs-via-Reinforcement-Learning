                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Patient with pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large pleural effusion has been almost fully evacuated from the
 right side of the chest.  The right lung demonstrates patchy opacities
 throughout the right mid to lower lung, which are nonspecific but could be
 explained by incompletely resolved atelectasis.  A small right-sided pleural
 effusion persists.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  The left lung remains
 clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post nearly complete evacuation of large right-sided
 pleural effusion without definite pneumothorax.  Patchy lower lung opacities
 persist, and are nonspecific, but could be seen with incompletely resolved
 atelectasis.  However, the presence of metastases cannot be excluded and
 followup radiographs may be considered accordingly.
