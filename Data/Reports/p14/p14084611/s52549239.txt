                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic right pleural effusion, pleural
 disease, for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was read in comparison with multiple
 prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study from ___, there are no
 significant changes.  Multiloculated right lung collection extending up to the
 right apex is similar.  Right lung base opacity with likely consolidation
 and/or atelectasis or aspiration is new.  Left upper lung is clear.  Minimal
 left lung base atelectasis and presumed small pleural effusions is similar.  A
 previously described small loculated air at the right lung base is less
 conspicuous because of more opacity, which is likely from a combination of
 atelectasis and/or consolidation. A single chest tube is present at right lung
 base, unchanged in position. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, loculated right pleural collections are
 unchanged, however, small opacity at the right lung base, which is likely
 atelectasis and/or consolidation or aspiration is new.
