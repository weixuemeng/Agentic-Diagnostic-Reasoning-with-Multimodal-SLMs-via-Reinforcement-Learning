                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malignant effusion from breast cancer, status post pleurodesis and
 chest tube placement.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 Compared with ___, there is new pronounced opacity in the right lung. 
 This appears to represent a combination of both pleural and parenchymal
 opacities extending throughout much of the right lung.  A right chest tube is
 seen at the base of the right lung.  An additional tube lies in the region of
 the right lung base or upper abdomen.  No definite pneumothorax, though the
 possibility of some loculated pleural air at the lung base cannot be entirely
 excluded.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum remains midline.  On the left,
 there is some patchy basilar and retrocardiac opacity. No left effusion. No
 evidence of CHF.   
   
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Considerable interval change compared with ___ at 14:21 p.m., now with
 patchy diffuse opacities throughout the right lung, likely a combination of
 parenchymal and pleural changes.  
 
 2.  No definite pneumothorax.  Please see comment.
 
 Right lung opacities discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 2:15 pm
 on the day of the exam.
