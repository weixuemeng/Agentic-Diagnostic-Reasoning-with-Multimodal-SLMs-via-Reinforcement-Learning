                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, 11:36 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right shoulder pain after thoracentesis, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema has cleared from the left lung.  Small left pleural effusion
 or basal atelectasis is responsible for obscuring the descending thoracic
 aorta, which is slightly more severe today than it was on ___.  The major
 changes are in the right lung where the multiloculated pleural abnormality is
 no smaller.  I do not see pneumothorax, but there is greater opacification of
 the right lung which could represent adjacent atelectasis, or if the patient
 has had pleurodesis, localized edema which is commonly seen after that
 procedure.  Heart size normal.
