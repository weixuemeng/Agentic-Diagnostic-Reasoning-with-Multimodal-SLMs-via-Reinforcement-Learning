                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  History of breast carcinoma, evaluate pleural effusion.  The
 patient has shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The diagnosis that the patient could not elevate her arms.
 
 There is an ongoing right-sided pleural effusion with some thickening of the
 minor fissure on the right side.  This appears grossly loculated and an
 extrapleural pleural-based mass cannot be excluded.  I do not identify a
 Pleurx catheter previously identified.  I do not identify pneumothorax.  There
 is volume loss in the right side, not significantly changed over prior.  There
 is increasing left-sided pleural effusion with significant blunting of the
 left costophrenic sulcus.  There is no evidence of fluid overload.  The
 osseous structures appear grossly normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Right-sided pleural effusion is probably little changed.
 
 New or worsening left-sided pleural effusion.
