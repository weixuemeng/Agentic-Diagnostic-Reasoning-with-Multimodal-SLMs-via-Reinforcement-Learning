                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, metastatic breast cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Right lower lobe opacity is
 persistent, could be due to atelectasis but other lung process or local area
 of effusion cannot be excluded.  An attention in this area should be paid in
 followup studies.  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe residual opacities
 could be due to reexpansion pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity is persistent, could be due to 
 atelectasis and fluid in the fissure but other lung process can be present.
 Follow up is recommended.
 
 No pneumothorax
