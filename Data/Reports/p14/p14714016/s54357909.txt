                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, with left-sided chest pain.  Assess for rib
 fracture, pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, with the latest on ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is slightly rotated, with
 appearance of the trachea deviated to the right.  There is persistent evidence
 of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis, left worse than right.  Increased soft tissue
 seen at the mediastinum on the left is as seen on prior CT scan and compatible
 with previoulsy identified mass. While there are no gross changes from the
 study seven days before, subtle interval changes are difficult to assess given
 the extensive background fibrosis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with a calcified aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent baseline left worse than right pulmonary fibrosis and left
 sided mass.  
 2.  No significant interval changes from 7 days ago.
