                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Noted on the prior
 chest CT, there is a left perihilar opacity and enlargement of the left hilar
 region with prominence of the mediastinal contours, compatible with known
 lymphadenopathy and nodularity along the left mediastinal border.  There are
 increased interstitial opacities most pronounced within the lung bases
 compatible with an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  Lung volumes
 are reduced.  No new focal consolidation is present.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are present. 
 There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study with
 continued mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  Left perihilar opacity
 correlates with ill-defined nodularity of the mediastinal pleura, better
 demonstrated on the prior chest CT.  Chronic interstitial lung disease.
