 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Possible lung cancer, evaluation for pleural changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a relatively diffuse subpleural parenchymal pathology with distortion of
 the parenchymal architecture, suggesting fibrotic changes.  As a consequence,
 the lung volumes remain low.  The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable,
 in particular, there is no evidence of lung masses or nodules.  There is
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Normal hilar structures.
