                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is diffuse reticular prominence of the pulmonary markings
 suggestive of chronic lung disease.  Left base opacity most likely relates to
 underlying fibrotic lung disease and atelectasis although consolidation is not
 entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
