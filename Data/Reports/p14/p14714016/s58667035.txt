                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with history of interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Diffuse left-greater-than-right
 interstitial prominence is keeping with known history of interstitial lung
 disease.  The most confluent opacity remains in the left base and does not
 appear significantly changed from previous examination.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 calcified aortic arch.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Diffuse left-greater-than-right pulmonary fibrosis without
 definite new opacity to suggest infectious process.
