                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  1 cm vague nodular focus is
 demonstrated projecting within the left mid lung field, at the confluence of
 the left anterior 5th rib and the left posterior 8th rib, not clearly
 visualized on the prior exam.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1 cm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung field, at the
 confluence of the left ___ anterior rib and left ___ posterior rib.  This
 could reflect a confluence of shadows, but a pulmonary nodule cannot be
 completely excluded.  Oblique views with nipple markers are recommended for
 further assessment.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
