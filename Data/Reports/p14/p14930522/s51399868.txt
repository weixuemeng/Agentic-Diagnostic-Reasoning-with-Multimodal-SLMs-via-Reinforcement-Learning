  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouettes.  No appreciable change in the loculated
  right pleural effusion.  Diffuse right lung opacification likely relates to
  atelectasis in the setting of the right pleural effusion, although underlying
  infection is difficult to exclude.  No focal consolidation of the left lung. 
  Right IJ CVC projects over the high SVC.  No pneumothorax identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung cancer, malignant pleural
 effusion s/p ___  // evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  A catheter or other line overlies the right upper lung.  If this
 is a right IJ central line, then the tip, though not well delineated, lies at
 or immediately proximal to the confluence of the right IJ and subclavian
 veins.  It is also possible this represents tubing outside the the patient.
 
 Again seen is diminished aerated portion of the right lung, with evidence for
 pleural fluid and/or thickening, widened right mediastinum, and possible
 slight shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette to the right.  There has been
 slight increase in the degree of confluence of the opacity at the right lung
 base compared to the study from ___ at 20:31.
 
 At the left lung base, the previously seen retrocardiac opacity has
 significantly improved an the left hemidiaphragm with no much better seen
 suggesting interval improvement in left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation and left effusion.  Minimal retrocardiac patchy opacity remains
 visible.  Elsewhere, the left lung is grossly clear.
 
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall similar appearance to the right loculated pleural effusion, though
 there does appear to been some increase in the degree of opacity at the right
 lung base.  The differential includes increased collapse and/or consolidation
 or increased opacity due to slight increase in pleural fluid.  Attention to
 this area on followup studies is recommended.
 
 Considerable interval improvement in left base opacity, with minimal residual
 patchy opacity now seen there.
