                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, cough, and 3 days of Left calf pain
 and swelling
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged compared
 to the most recent radiograph.  Right basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis appears slightly worse in the interval.  Heart size is difficult
 to assess, but appears grossly unchanged as are the mediastinal and hilar
 contours.  Left lung is clear.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of moderate to large right pleural effusion.  Interval
 worsening of right basilar atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely
 excluded in the right lung base.
