                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hx of NSCLC cb effusion recently drained, with
 LLE pain.  // Please evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent volume loss of the right lung with a right-sided pleural
 effusion which is likely at least partially loculated.  Fluoro strain is
 stable to possibly slightly decreased as compared to the prior study.  Right
 mid lung opacity may be combination of fissural fluid and atelectasis, but
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  No definite pneumothorax is seen. 
 The left lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent volume loss of the right lung with right pleural effusion which may
 be partially loculated, stable to possibly slightly decreased as compared the
 prior study.  Right midhemi thorax opacity may be combination of fissural
 fluid and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Clear left lung.
