                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of
 the transverse diameter of the heart.  There are areas of increased
 opacification at the right base medially as well as in the mid and lower
 portions of the left lung.  Although some of this could reflect elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure, in view of the clinical history, multifocal
 pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
