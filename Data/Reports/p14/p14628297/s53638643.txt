                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bicyclist struck by a car, transferred from an outside hospital
 for rib fractures and small pneumothorax seen on outside CT exam.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from___ dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 exaggerate moderate vascular engorgement; there is no pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or focal consolidation seen.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is noted.  Small left pneumothorax seen on a reference CT obtained
 four hours prior, is not appreciated on this radiograph.
 
 Erosion of the medial articular surface of the right clavicle is chronic, but
 should be evaluated when practical.
