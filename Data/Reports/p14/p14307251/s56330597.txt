                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic knob are again present. Lung volumes are low with
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Diffuse increased interstitial
 opacities likely reflect chronic changes.  Patchy opacity in the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis but is nonspecific. No overt pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is present. There is no large pleural effusion. No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with chronic interstitial changes. Patchy left basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded in the correct
 setting
