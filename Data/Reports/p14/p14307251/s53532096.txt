                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with
 calcification of the aortic knob.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Increased interstitial markings diffusely is consistent with
 interstitial edema.  Apparent new consolidation at the right lung base maybe
 exaggerated by increased interstitial markings.  Again seen are multiple wedge
 deformities of the thoracic spine, the more inferior one of which is stable;
 however, the more superior compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine
 appears progressed compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. New interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 2. Worsening compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine.
