                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes are
 noted.  There is blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles on the frontal
 view which may be in part due to overlying soft tissues.  Although, there is
 minimal blunting of one of the posterior costophrenic angles on the lateral
 view, likely on the right with the other not visualized due to spinal
 hardware.  There is no confluent consolidation or large effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Posterior spinal fixation hardware is seen
 spanning the mid to lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible trace effusions.  Otherwise no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
