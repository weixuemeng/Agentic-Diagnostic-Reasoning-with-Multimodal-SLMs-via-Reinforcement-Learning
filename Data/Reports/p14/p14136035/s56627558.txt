                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD.  Shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Hyperinflation is chronic, consistent with COPD, either emphysema or chronic
 small airway obstruction.  Enlargement of the hila suggests elevated pulmonary
 artery pressure, although overall heart size is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  Lateral view shows
 atherosclerotic calcification in the proximal head and neck vessels.  No
 pneumonia.
