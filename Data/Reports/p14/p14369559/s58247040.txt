                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Upper
 zone vascular re-distribution is present, but there is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions appear relatively
 similar to the prior radiograph except for slight increase in the right
 effusion.  Adjacent bibasilar atelectasis is also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
 basilar atelectasis.  Prominence of the thoracic aorta, in keeping with a
 history of recent ascending aortic surgery.  This has been more fully
 evaluated by a recent outside chest CT of one day earlier.
