  1. No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Please note that this
  study neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
  2.  At least substantial bibasilar atelectasis in a background of low lung
  volumes.  Consider repeating at least the lateral view, and possibly also the
  PA view, with deeper inspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female on Xarelto for prior PE, now presenting for
 evaluation of chest pain that began approximately 1 hr after vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the most recent radiograph performed on ___, lung
 volumes are lower.  There is at least substantial atelectasis at the bilateral
 lung bases.  Previously noted right infrahilar opacity is difficult to assess
 due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Upper lung zones are clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  No
 evidence of pneumomediastinum.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Please note that this
 study neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 2.  At least substantial bibasilar atelectasis in a background of low lung
 volumes.  Consider repeating at least the lateral view, and possibly also the
 PA view, with deeper inspiration.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1. If there is persistent clinical concern for pulmonary
 embolism, a chest CTA should be considered.
 2.  Consider repeating at least the lateral CXR for better assessment of the
 lung bases.
