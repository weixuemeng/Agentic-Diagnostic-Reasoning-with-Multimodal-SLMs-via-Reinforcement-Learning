                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube continues to be slightly high, at the thoracic inlet. 
 NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.  There continue to be
 low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular re-distribution.  There are
 new/increased opacities in both lower lungs.  While this could be due to
 volume loss, early infiltrate cannot be excluded.
