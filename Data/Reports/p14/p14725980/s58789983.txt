                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Septic left hip, transferred from outside facility.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The right lower lobe and right
 middle lobe consolidations are demonstrated, and may reflect infectious
 process.  There is also presence of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Comparison with prior studies if obtained in outside
 facility would be beneficial.
