                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting with postoperative hypotension. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from ___ at 12:16 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube, nasoenteric catheter, and
 left subclavian central venous catheter are in standard expected unchanged
 position.  Linear opacities within the lung bases are unchanged and consistent
 with plate-like atelectasis.  There is new mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 and new blunting of the right costophrenic angle, worrisome for mild volume
 overload.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The heart
 size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Basilar plate-like atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  New mild pulmonary vascular congestion 
 3.  Standard position of support devices.
