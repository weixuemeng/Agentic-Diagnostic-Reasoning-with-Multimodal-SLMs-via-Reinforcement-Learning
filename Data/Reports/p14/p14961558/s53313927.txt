                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with newly diagnosed atrial
 fibrillation and AML, complicated by neutropenic fever and WBC.  Evaluate for
 acute infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with a next preceding similar study of
 ___.  There is further clearance of the previously described
 remaining bilateral basal densities that represented pleural effusions
 following an episode of CHF.  The diaphragms are now visible but only
 remaining mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus.  The right-sided
 pleural sinus is free.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 infiltrates of pneumonic appearance.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical
 area.  A left-sided subclavian approach central venous line remains in
 unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.  No evidence
 of new acute pneumonic infiltrate on this portable AP single view chest
 examination.
