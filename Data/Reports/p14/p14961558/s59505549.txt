                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L vats wedge resection of LLL  // eval for
 pnx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.  A cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion. 
 Previously seen left apical pneumothorax is not seen on the current study,
 however the linear interface in the medial left lower lung with adjacent
 opacification may represent air adjacent to atelectatic lung parenchyma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Previously seen left apical pneumothorax is no longer seen.
 2. Linear interface in the left lower lung may represent a small to moderate
 medial pneumothorax with adjacent atelectasis as seen on the prior study.
