                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, crackles, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral parenchymal opacities at the
 lung bases, likely atelectatic in origin.  Moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions, better seen on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  In
 addition, in both upper lobes, and predominantly located in perihilar lung
 areas, are subtle parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, likely
 reflecting pneumonia.  No change in appearance of the hilar structures.  No
 pneumothorax.  
 
 All of the described changes are better visualized on a CT examination
 performed on ___, 7:53 a.m.
