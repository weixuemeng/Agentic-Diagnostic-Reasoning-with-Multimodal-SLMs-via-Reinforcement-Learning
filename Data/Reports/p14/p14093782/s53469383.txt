                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right chest tube placement  // r/o PTX    
 r/o PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Following insertion of a right pigtail pleural drainage catheter projecting
 over the rule middle of the right hemi thorax, the fissural component of the
 moderate right pleural effusion which developed between ___ and ___
 has decreased, but the dependent component of pleural effusion has increased. 
 Since there is no chest radiograph performed immediately before the drainage
 procedure, it is unclear how much the pleural fluid volume has changed
 recently.  There is no pneumothorax.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Patient
 has had median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is more pronounced, but there is no appreciable pulmonary edema.
