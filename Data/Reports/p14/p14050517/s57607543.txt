                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.  Within the
 limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
 detected.
 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
 
 A small (5.4 mm) rounded opacity overlying the left anterior third rib
 inferiorly likely represents a small calcified granuloma.  Additional tiny
 calcified focus is seen in the aortopulmonary window.  No other stigmata of
 granulomatous disease are identified radiographically.
 
 Incidental note is made of a tapered appearance of the distal right clavicle,
 with well corticated edge--___ postsurgical.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly.
 2. Calcified granulomas suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.
 3. No acute pulmonary process identified.
