                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly and large hiatal hernia are again demonstrated. 
 Nonspecific opacities are present at the lung bases adjacent to small pleural
 effusions.  This most likely due to basilar atelectasis, but aspiration is an
 additional consideration in the setting of a large hiatal hernia.
