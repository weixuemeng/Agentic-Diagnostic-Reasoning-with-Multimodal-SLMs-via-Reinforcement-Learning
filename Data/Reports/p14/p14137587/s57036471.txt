                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with a history of sleep apnea, obesity, now
 here with orthopnea, evaluate for evidence of CHF or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. CT chest without contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Limited study due to extensive overlying soft tissue and low lung volumes in
 the setting of a suboptimal inspiratory effort. Within these limitations,
 there is stable mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, possibly from
 mediastinal lipomatosis. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Mild diffuse
 interstitial prominence and irregularly marginated pulmonary vasculature may
 signify pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema. There is no
 focal lung consolidation. The bilateral costophrenic angles are not well seen
 due to overlying soft tissues, making it difficult to exclude trace pleural
 effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to extensive overlying soft tissue and low lung volumes.
 Mild diffuse interstitial prominence may reflect pulmonary vascular congestion
 and mild pulmonary edema.  No focal lung consolidation.
