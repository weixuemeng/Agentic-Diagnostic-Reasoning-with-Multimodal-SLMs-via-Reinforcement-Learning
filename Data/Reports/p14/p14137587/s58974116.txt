                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, HTN, DM with progressive DOE  // SOB
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique and positioning, there has not been a
 relevant change in the appearance of the chest since the previous study of
 ___.  Mild cardiomegaly is present.  Lung volumes are low and
 assessment of lung detail is limited by large body habitus.  No definite areas
 of consolidation are identified, but standard PA and lateral views the chest
 would be helpful for more complete assessment of the lungs when the patient's
 condition permits.
