                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/o CP with DOE  // ? PNA or CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 The mediastinum appears slightly more prominent compared to the prior study
 but similar in configuration, likely due to significantly lower lung volumes
 as compared to the prior study.  There is basilar atelectasis without definite
 focal consolidation.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this, there
 is basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  No pulmonary
 edema is seen.
