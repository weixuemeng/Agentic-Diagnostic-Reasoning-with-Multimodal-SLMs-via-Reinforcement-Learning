                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HTN, HL who presented with CP, found to have
 multi-vessel disease, now with dyspnea after cardiac cath  // evaluate for
 pulmonary edema, aspiration, atelectasis     evaluate for pulmonary edema,
 aspiration, atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___.
 
 Some of the increase in caliber of the upper mediastinum, primarily in the
 right paratracheal location is due to venous engorgement just from semi-erect
 positioning, but there has probably been an increase in central venous
 pressure or volume or both.  Possibility of new pericardial effusion should be
 evaluated clinically.
 
 If this were due to mediastinal hemorrhage, I would expect contralateral
 displacement of the trachea which has not recurred.  Allowing for differences
 in radiographic technique cardiac size has not increased.
 
 Lungs are clear.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___ , M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:13 AM, 1 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
