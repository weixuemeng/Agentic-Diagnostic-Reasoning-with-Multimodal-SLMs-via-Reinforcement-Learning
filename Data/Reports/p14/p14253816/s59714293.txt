                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hydrocephalus, nausea and vomiting. Preoperative evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with trace unfolding of the thoracic aortic arch.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Questionable 3 cm
 ovoid density in the left lung base with possible retrocardiac correlate.
 Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indeterminate 3 cm ovoid density in the left lung base with possible
 retrocardiac correlate on lateral view.  While it is possible this represents
 a nipple shadow, either repeat radiograph with nipple markers or CT
 examination is recommended.
