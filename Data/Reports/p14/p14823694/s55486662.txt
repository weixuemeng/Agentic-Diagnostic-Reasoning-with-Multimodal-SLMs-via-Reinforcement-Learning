                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with continued oxygen requirement  // eval for
 effusions, atelectasis      eval for effusions, atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at both bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms.  This is consistent
 with layering effusions and underlying volume loss in the lower lobes,
 especially on the left.  Streaks of atelectasis are also seen in the lower
 zones.
