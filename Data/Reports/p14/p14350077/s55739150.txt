                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post left lower lobe biopsy.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are persistent multifocal opacities in the right upper, right
 lower, and left lower lung zones, all of which has increased from the prior
 chest radiograph.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Multifocal opacities, worse since the prior chest radiograph, which are
 likely infectious.  Given the history of lymphoma, recurrent lymphoma is also
 a consideration.
