 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with febrile elderly woman with dementia and
 crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates at the lower
 SVC.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary edema is new in the
 interval.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may potentially be reflective
 of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.

 Mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
