                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increased shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema as well as a
 suspected small left-sided pleural effusion.  The possibility of focal opacity
 in the medial right lower lung is also raised by asymmetry of opacification in
 this area and obscuring of the right heart border.  There are severe
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine, similar to ___, including
 similar thoracolumbar compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.  Equivocal focal opacity at the right
 medial lung base; follow-up radiographs are recommended after treatment of
 edema to assess for whether it may persist.
