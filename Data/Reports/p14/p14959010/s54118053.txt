                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female who presents for followup of a chronic right
 upper lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is within upper limits of normal and the mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Again seen is a subtle area of opacification
 previously reported in the periphery of the right upper lobe.  No other focal
 opacities are seen.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and otherwise clear.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal peripheral right upper lobe opacity appears stable compared
 to the prior exam. 
 
 As suggested on the previous study, evaluation with a chest CT may be helpful
 to definitively exclude the possibility of a slowly growing malignancy at this
 site.
