                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with trach/PEG evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy ends 7.4 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar opacities consistent
 with aspiration have significantly improved since previous exam.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 unremarkable.  Right-sided PICC line ends in lower SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy is in adequate position.
 2.  Significant improvement of bibasilar opacities, possibly due to
 aspiration.
