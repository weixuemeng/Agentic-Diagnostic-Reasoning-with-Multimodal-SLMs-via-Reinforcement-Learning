                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with one year of cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A crescentic opacity projecting inferiorly from the right hilus
 is partially obscured by the right heart, but does not taper likely a normal
 vessel.  It is either an abnormally large vessel (seen in the congenital
 disorder of hypogenetic lung syndrome) or a region of atelectasis.  In either
 case, given the protracted symptoms, I would advise chest CT.
 
 Lungs are otherwise well inflated and clear.  Heart size is top normal, but
 the pulmonary and hilar vasculature are otherwise normal.  There is no pleural
 abnormality.
