                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough and worsening SOB.  //
 Infection? Plum Edema from CHF?      Infection? Plum Edema from CHF?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is probably little overall
 change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with coarse
 prominence of interstitial markings, which could reflect chronic pulmonary
 disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both. The increased
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm has
 substantially cleared. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen
 bilaterally.
