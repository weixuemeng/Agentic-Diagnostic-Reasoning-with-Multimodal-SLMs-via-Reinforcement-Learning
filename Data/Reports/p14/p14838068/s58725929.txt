                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old woman with HIV, CHF with SOB 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs appear somewhat
 hyperinflated with coarsened lung markings within the lungs bilaterally
 relatively sparing the right mid lung.  Overall findings appear stable from
 prior exam and clinical correlation for underlying chronic lung disease is
 advised.  There is no superimposed consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic interstitial opacities suggesting chronic lung disease.  No definite
 signs of superimposed pneumonia.  Consider high-resolution CT of the chest to
 further assess on a nonemergent basis.
