                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Architectural distortion with
 increased opacity in the lung apices bilaterally and superior retraction of
 the hila suggests a chronic process.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 No pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular engorgement, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Architectural distortion with scarring and superior retraction of hila suggest
 a chronic process, such a sarcoidosis. Clinical correlation and comparison
 with prior radiographs is recommended, or further evaluation with CT can be
 obtained if prior studies are unavailable.
