 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with morbid obesity, ___ SIRS criteria, lactate
 3.0  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___ MOST RECENTLY ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are considerably lower accounting in part but probably not
 completely for an apparent enlargement of the vascular pedicle of the
 mediastinum, and a crowding of dilated pulmonary vasculature. Heart is
 probably unchanged, moderately enlarged. Overall findings suggest increased
 volume overload.  There are no focal findings in the lungs to suggest
 pneumonia, but an early pneumonia would be difficult to see. Pleural effusion
 is small if any.  No pneumothorax.
