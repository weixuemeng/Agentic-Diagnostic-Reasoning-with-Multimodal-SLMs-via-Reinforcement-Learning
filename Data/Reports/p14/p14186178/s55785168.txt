                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of nausea and elevated lactate.  Please evaluate for
 interval line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  This is a very limited exam due to low lung volumes and obscuration
 of the apices by the patient's chin.  There is a right-sided IJ whose tip is
 difficult to definitively visualize.  Aside from bilateral atelectasis, the
 small visualized portion of the upper-to-mid lungs is unremarkable.  No
 definite pneumothorax is identified.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right IJ tip is difficult to visualize on this exam. An exam with
 better inspiration is recommended.
