                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, worsening pain, confusion, weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis
 from outside institution dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are present.  New moderate-to-large left pleural
 effusion is noted which obscures the cardiac silhouette thereby making
 assessment of the heart size difficult.  Additionally, there is left basilar
 opacification which may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  There is likely mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with left basilar
 opacification likely reflecting compressive atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
