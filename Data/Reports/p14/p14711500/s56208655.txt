 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with decompensated HCV cirrhosis and
 diabetes who presents with worsening mental status and hyponatremia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 18:03.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest of ___ at 11:52 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Feeding tube is seen with its tip projecting over the stomach.  Lungs are
 somewhat lower in volume with streaky linear opacity at the right base likely
 represents subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  There is a small left
 effusion with associated airspace opacity in the retrocardiac region which
 most likely represents compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
