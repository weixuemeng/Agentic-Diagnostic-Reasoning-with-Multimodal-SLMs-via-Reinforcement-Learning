                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with pancreatic head mass status post Whipple, now with
 fever, rule out pneumonia versus atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right IJ central line terminates in the lower SVC.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Aside from subsegmental left mid and lower lung atelectasis, the
 rest of the lung parenchyma is clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The elevation of the right hemidiaphragm predates surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental left mid and lower lung atelectasis without focal
 consolidation.
