                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath
 and right rib pain, rule out rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiologist note, patient has anterior to posterior chest pain under the right
 breast area.
 
 Involving the lateral segment of the right middle lobe, there is a
 wedge-shaped opacity.  There are also is apparent focal mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Findings may be due to focal lung collapse.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, a pulmonary infarct would not be excluded.  Left
 lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced rib fracture is seen,
 although if clinical concern for rib fracture, suggest dedicated rib series as
 this is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral right middle lobe wedge-shaped opacity with possible
 focal mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Correlate with any history
 of recent trauma or procedure at this site if clinical concern for pulmonary
 embolism, as this cannot be excluded.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 the ___ Emergency Department on ___ after the conclusion of this
 study.
