                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, now improving clinically  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___  at 05:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  On the
 current film, there is again suggestion of looping of the tube in the
 hypopharynx.  Left-sided PICC line is present, tip likely over the mid SVC.
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, spine doubt
 significant interval change.  Background hyperinflation suggests bCOPD.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is  prominent, similar to the prior study.  Again
 seen are left greater right pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, with more extensive hazy opacity in the right mid/lower zones. 
 There is upper zone redistribution with mild vascular plethora, but I doubt
 overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearance is similar compared with 1 day earlier.
 
 Apparent looping of the NG tube in the hypopharynx again noted.  Clinical
 correlation requested.
