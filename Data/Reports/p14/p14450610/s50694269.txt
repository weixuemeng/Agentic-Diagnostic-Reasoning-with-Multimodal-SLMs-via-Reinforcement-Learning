                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory failure, status post intubation, confirm ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___.
 
 On the current examination, an ET tube is present, the tip lies at the level
 of the mid clavicular heads approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  An NG-type
 tube is present.  The tip lies beneath the diaphragm extending off the film. 
 Equivocal site of the side port overlying the lower esophagus.  This may also
 be an artifact, and therefore clinical correlation is requested.  
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly similar to the prior film.  There is also upper
 zone re-distribution, diffuse vascular blurring and probable subtle areas of
 alveolar opacity in both lungs, consistent with CHF.  There is increased
 opacity at both bases consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.
 The possibility of small effusions would be difficult to exclude.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.  
 2.  NG tube beneath diaphragm off film.  Location of side port uncertain --
 please see comment above.
 3.  CHF with interstitial and suspected alveolar edema.
 4.  Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  Small effusions cannot be
 excluded.
