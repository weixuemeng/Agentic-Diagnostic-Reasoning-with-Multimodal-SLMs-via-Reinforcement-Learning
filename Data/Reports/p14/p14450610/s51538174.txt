                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of respiratory distress.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion with diffuse bilateral moderate pulmonary edema.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Adjacent opacities are likely secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  There
 is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent opacities likely secondary
 to atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
