  goiter.
  2.  Prominence of the mediastinum is worrisome for an ascending aortic
  aneurysm.
  3. Subtle retrocardiac opacity only seen on lateral projection likely
  represents degenerative changes of thoracic spine.

 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is thickening of the right paratracheal stripe since ___ worrisome
 for mass lesion in a patient with known large retrosternal thyroid goiter.
 
   The lungs are well inflated and clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 There is prominence of the mediastinum worrisome for an ascending aortic
 aneurysm.  Heart size and hila are otherwise unremarkable.  Evidence of prior
 cardiac surgery with intact median sternotomy wires and valve replacement.
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity is only seen on lateral projection is most
 consistent with degenerative changes as seen on CT from ___.

 aneurysm.
 3. Subtle retrocardiac opacity only seen on lateral projection likely
 represents degenerative changes of thoracic spine.
