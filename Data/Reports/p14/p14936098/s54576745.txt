                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No focal
 consolidation, definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Mild
 interstitial opacity is re- demonstrated within the right lung base
 particularly laterally, which could reflect a chronic process.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence for pneumonia.  Mild interstitial abnormality within the right
 lung base may reflect chronic changes.
