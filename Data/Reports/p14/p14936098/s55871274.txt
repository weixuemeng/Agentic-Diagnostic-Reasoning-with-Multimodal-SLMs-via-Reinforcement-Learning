                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of CVA, post-fall assess for rib
 fractures.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard
 position.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Calcified granuloma
 in the left mid lung is again noted.  There are minimal reticular opacities in
 the lower lobes bilaterally.  They are nonspecific and likely chronic, could
 be related with mild chronic interstitial edema or interstitial lung disease. 
 Dense opacity in the right upper lobe projecting between the posterior fourth
 and fifth ribs is likely a calcified granuloma.
 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumonia.
