                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increasing aggression and headache.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  As on prior, there are relatively low lung volumes seen. 
 This likely accounts for crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings.  The
 lungs are clear of consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
 There is an apparent healing fracture of the left lateral seventh rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
