                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sudden onset tachycardia now resolved  // eval
 for CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is
 patchy left mid to lower lung opacity.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is seen.  Bilateral paratracheal opacity in the upper mediastinum
 without indentation on the trachea may relate to prominent vasculature.  The
 lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  Relative lucency of the upper lungs is
 seen; combination of findings suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Thoracic scoliosis is noted.  Pigtail catheter is noted overlying the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy mid left lung opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution to exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion.
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening.
 
 Cardiomegaly.
 
 COPD.
