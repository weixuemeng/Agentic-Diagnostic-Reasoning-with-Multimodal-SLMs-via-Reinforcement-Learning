                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post pericardial stripping,
 evaluate for pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding supine chest examination of ___.  The patient has
 been extubated.  The previously persistent right-sided internal jugular
 approach sheath has been removed completely.  No pneumothorax has developed. 
 Midline sternotomy wires, as before.  The heart silhouette appears larger than
 on the preceding examination; however, the cardiac enlargement is uncertain,
 considering portable AP single view chest technique.  The accessible pulmonary
 vasculature is not more congested than it was before.
