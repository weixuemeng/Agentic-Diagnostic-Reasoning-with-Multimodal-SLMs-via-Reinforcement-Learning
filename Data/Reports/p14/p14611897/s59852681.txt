 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration. There is still enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with the left lower lobe pneumonia seen on CT
 scan. Mild hyperexpansion is consistent with the substantial emphysema noted
 on CT.
