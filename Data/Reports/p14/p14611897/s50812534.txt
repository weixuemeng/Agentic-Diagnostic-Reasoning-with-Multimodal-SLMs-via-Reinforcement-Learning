                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased
 retrosternal clear space compatible with underlying COPD.  Linear opacities
 are noted at the lung bases which may reflect areas of scarring and/or
 atelectasis.  Minimal patchy opacity is also noted at the right costophrenic
 angle, which could reflect an area of infection.  Mildly increased
 interstitial markings are noted within both lungs, which could reflect a
 chronic interstitial process.  No large pleural effusion is demonstrated, and
 no pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are present within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity projecting over the right costophrenic angle may
 reflect an area of pneumonia.  COPD.
