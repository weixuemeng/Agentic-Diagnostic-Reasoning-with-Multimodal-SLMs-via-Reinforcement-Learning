                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 23:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 23:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs appear mildly hyperinflated.  There is asymmetric left apical
 pleural thickening.  In addition, there are at least three discrete nodular
 opacities seen in the right upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe. 
 In the absence of comparison studies, although these may represent granulomas,
 this cannot be ascertained with certainty and therefore either comparison to
 remote chest films or a dedicated imaging with CT should be considered at this
 time.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 patient's nurse, ___, was notified by phone of these findings on ___ at
 9:17 a.m. at the time of discovery.
