                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Slight blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles may relate to the hyperinflated lungs, although
 trace pleural effusions are not excluded.  There is patchy opacity projecting
 over the left lower lung adjacent to the left heart border.  Suggest oblique
 views for further evaluation.  The mediastinum is not widened.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The mediastinum is not widened.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs.  Slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 may relate to the hyperinflated lungs, although trace effusions not excluded. 
 Opacity projecting just adjacent to the left heart border on the frontal view,
 not definitively seen on the lateral view may relate to nipple shadow or other
 external artifact.  Suggest repeat with nipple markers and/or oblique views
 for confirmation.
