                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Intermittent garbled speech.
 
 COMPARISON:  Torso CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs show stable cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours.  Biapical pleural thickening also appears unchanged. A lingular
 nodule noted on the prior CT is not well visualized on this examination
 probably due to differences in technique.  A newly apparent area of increased
 density projecting over the right lung apex and course of the right posterior
 lateral fifth rib suggests an interval rib fracture although it is difficult
 to exclude a pulmonary nodule.  Follow-up by was also previously recommended
 for a small pulmonary nodule in the lingula.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Possible nodule versus bone finding or scarring at the right apex. 
 Previously, one year follow-up was recommended for a lingular nodule, which
 cannot be assessed by radiography.  Follow-up chest CT is recommended to
 assess both findings.
