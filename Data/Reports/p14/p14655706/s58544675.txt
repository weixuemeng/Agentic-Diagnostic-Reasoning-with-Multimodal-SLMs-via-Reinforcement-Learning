                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and right lower lobe pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a opacity in the right middle lobe, as well as one in the
 left lower lobe.  This is most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  There is
 no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommended
 followup chest radiograph after treatment to ensure resolution.
