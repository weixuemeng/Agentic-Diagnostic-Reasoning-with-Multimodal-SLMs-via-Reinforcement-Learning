                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV Non small cell lung cancer with cough and swollen glands. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest there is evidence ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and  lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Small ground-glass nodlues appreciated on the prior CT are only
 vaguely identified here, particularly in the right lung.  There is no large
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
