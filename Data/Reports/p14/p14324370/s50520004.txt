                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metastatic lung cancer, malignant
 effusion, and shortness of breath.  Study requested for evaluation of effusion
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior radiograph from ___, lung
 volumes are low which accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  There has been interval increase of a right-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is no effusion on the left.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Again seen is a tiny density in the left chest wall, projecting over the left
 mid lung, which corresponds to a metallic artifact seen on prior chest CT
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase of right-sided pleural effusion.
