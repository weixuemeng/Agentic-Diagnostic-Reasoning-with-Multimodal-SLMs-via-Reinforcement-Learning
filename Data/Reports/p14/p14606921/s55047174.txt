                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Peripheral
 reticular opacities are noted, most pronounced in the mid-to-lower lungs,
 which appear stable to minimally progressed which could reflect the patient's
 known emphysema/fibrosis.  There is no clear sign of a superimposed
 consolidation or signs of CHF.  Old right rib cage deformity is noted.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peripheral reticular markings notable at the lung bases likely
 indicative of chronic fibrotic change.  No superimposed pneumonia or CHF.
