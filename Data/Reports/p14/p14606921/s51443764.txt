                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary hypertension, ?scleroderma, with
 worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia  // eval for pnumeonia, acute process
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, heart size remains normal and
 lobulated enlargement of the hila is unchanged. The latter could reflect
 enlarged pulmonary vessels related to history of pulmonary hypertension,
 likely with superimposed lymph node enlargement, especially on the right.
 Superimposed upon pre-existing basilar predominant interstitial abnormalities
 is an area of increased confluent opacification of the right lung base.  There
 are no pleural effusions.  Mild compression deformities are seen within the
 mid thoracic spine and appear unchanged. Deformities of right-sided ribs may
 be posttraumatic or postsurgical.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Confluent right lower lobe opacification is concerning for pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  This is superimposed upon chronic basilar
 predominant interstitial lung disease.
