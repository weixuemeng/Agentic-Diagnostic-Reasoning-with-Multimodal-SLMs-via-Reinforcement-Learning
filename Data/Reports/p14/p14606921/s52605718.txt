                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD/pulm fibrosis/pulm HTN with worsening
 cough/SOB  // r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs. CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall appearance of the chest is similar to previous studies, with mild
 cardiac enlargement, marked enlargement of central pulmonary arteries
 (suggestive of pulmonary hypertension), and right mediastinal and hilar
 prominence attributed to lymphadenopathy based on prior CT.  Diffuse
 interstitial abnormality is also similar to prior exams.  Healed right rib
 fractures are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar radiographic appearance of the chest compared to ___.
 However, in a patient with such complex radiographic appearance, a subtle
 abnormality may be difficult to detect. Considering worsening pulmonary
 symptoms, CT may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lungs in order
 to exclude progressive interstitial fibrosis, superimposed early pneumonia, or
 other acute process.
