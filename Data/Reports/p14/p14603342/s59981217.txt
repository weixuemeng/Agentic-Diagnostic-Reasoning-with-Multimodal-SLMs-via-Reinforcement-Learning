                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Most
 striking in the anterior right upper lobe, there is a region of vague opacity
 with peribronchial cuffing and interstitial prominence with less striking but
 similar types of changes seen throughout each lung, new since the prior
 examination.  A predominantly peripheral distribution is not typical for
 pulmonary edema, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting an interstitial abnormality with bronchial
 cuffing and suggestion of peripheral predominance.  Differential
 considerations include airway inflammation, atypical pattern of infection or
 the possibility of interstitial disease.
