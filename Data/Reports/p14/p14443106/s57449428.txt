                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is stable in position with lead extending to the
 expected locations of the right ventricle coronary sinus.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains markedly enlarged.  There is persistent obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm which may in part relate to overlying soft tissue ;
 however, on the lateral view, there is focal opacity projecting over the
 posterior lung base which could be due to focal consolidation or less likely
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity projecting over the posterior lung base on the lateral view, not well
 seen on the frontal view, but could be due to consolidation from infection or
 aspiration, less likely pleural effusion.
 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
