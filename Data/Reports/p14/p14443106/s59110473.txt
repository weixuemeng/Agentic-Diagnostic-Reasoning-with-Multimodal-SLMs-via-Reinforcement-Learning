                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating the regions
 of the coronary sinus and right ventricle.  Heart remains severely enlarged,
 perhaps minimally decreased in size from the prior study.  Mediastinal contour
 is unchanged.  There is continued mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved in
 the interval.  Left basilar opacification likely reflects a combination of a
 small pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, not substantially changed
 from the prior.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.  Continued opacification
 of the left lung base likely reflective of a combination of left basilar
 atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
