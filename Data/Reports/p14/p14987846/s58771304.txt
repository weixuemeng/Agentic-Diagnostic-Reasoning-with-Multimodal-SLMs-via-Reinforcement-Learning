                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacity in
 the left mid lung likely due to atelectasis versus scarring.  There is also
 blunting of the lateral costophrenic angle on the left, potentially due to
 scar.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are tiny metallic densities which
 project over the left hilum, not clearly seen on the lateral view but
 potentially in the posteriorly.  There is a moderate lower thoracic
 dextroscoliosis.  The cardiomediastinal contour which is grossly within normal
 limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Metallic densities projecting
 over the region of the left hilum, potentially within the posterior soft
 tissues.
