                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube
 in place with the tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications are even more prominent on the current study.
 
 Nasogastric tube is in place, though the tip cannot be visualized as it passes
 through the mediastinum and upper abdomen.  An abdominal film would be
 necessary to precisely demonstrate the tip of the tube.
