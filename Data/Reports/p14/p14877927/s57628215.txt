                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  However, there is no evidence of
 fibrosis.  Scarring at both lateral aspects of the chest on the frontal
 radiograph, however, could suggest the presence of minimal fibrotic changes. 
 There is no pleural calcification and no obvious pleural thickening.  Punctate
 calcifications in the left upper lobe suggest prior exposure to TB. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
