                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are faint streaky opacities at the bases and periphery of the
 mid lungs, similar to the prior study, compatible with atelectasis.  There is
 no focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal with exception of a tortuous and
 unfolded aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are two
 screws projecting over the right proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic areas
 of linear atelectasis.
