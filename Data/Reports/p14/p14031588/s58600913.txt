                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Swollen bilateral ankles, assess CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta appears unfolded.  There is mild central hilar
 prominence/engorgement, which could reflect mild increased central pulmonary
 arterial pressures.  The lungs appear clear without focal consolidation,
 effusion, pneumothorax, or signs of pulmonary edema.  Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild central hilar engorgement could reflect increased
 pulmonary arterial pressures.  Otherwise, unremarkable exam.
