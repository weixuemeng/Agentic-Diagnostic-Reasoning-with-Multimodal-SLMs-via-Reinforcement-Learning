                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Increased attenuation in the peripheral
 lung bases likely represents artifact due to overlying soft tissues; however
 there is subtle opacity projecting over the lateral left lung base, while not
 substantiated on the lateral view, consolidation from infection can not be
 entirely excluded. There is no vascular congestion, overt edema, or large
 pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased attenuation in the peripheral lung bases likely
 represents artifact due to overlying soft tissues; however there is subtle
 opacity projecting over the lateral left lung base, while not substantiated on
 the lateral view, consolidation from infection can not be entirely excluded.
