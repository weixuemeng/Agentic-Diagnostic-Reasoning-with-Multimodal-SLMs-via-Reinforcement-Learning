                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Likely alveolar proteinosis, status post BAL.  Evaluate interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiographs ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 courses along the esophagus and terminates likely within the stomach.
 
 Diffuse bilateral patchy opacities in appear largely unchanged from yesterday
 evening with further definition of the diaphragmatic and cardiac contours. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged severe bilateral air opacities with unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  
 While alveolar proteinosis is a consideration, given the patient's underlying
 degree of peripheral fibrosis at baseline seen on outside studies, AIP should
 remain in the differential.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:37 AM on ___ by
 telephone at the time of dictation.
