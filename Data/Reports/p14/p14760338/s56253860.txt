                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:30 A.M.  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with diffuse interstitial changes.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 552.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 5:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial and confluent airspace opacities are
 unchanged in this patient with suspected alveolar proteinosis.  Evaluation for
 a superimposed acute infectious process is challenging given the radiographic
 appearance.  The heart remains enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stably
 enlarged.  No large effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Calcification in
 the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
