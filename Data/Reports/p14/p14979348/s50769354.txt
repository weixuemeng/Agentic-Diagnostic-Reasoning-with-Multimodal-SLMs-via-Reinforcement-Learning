                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, drooling, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate to severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with a slightly globular
 configuration.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases are not
 substantially changed in the interval, potentially atelectasis, but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No substantial interval change from the prior exam obtained earlier in the
 day.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with patchy opacities in lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 2. Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a somewhat
 globular configuration raises the possibility for the presence of a
 pericardial effusion and consider echocardiography for further assessment.
