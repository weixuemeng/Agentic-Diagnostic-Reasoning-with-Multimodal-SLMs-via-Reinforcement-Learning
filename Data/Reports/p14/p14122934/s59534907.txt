                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB, crackles all the way both lung fields 
 // ? CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung volume is low with elevation of left hemidiaphragm suggesting
 volume loss likely secondary to left basilar atelectasis.  Small moderate left
 pleural effusion.  Right basilar atelectasis.  There are extensive indistinct
 interstitial markings which are more likely consistent with pulmonary edema
 but some may reflect chronic lung disease and/or interstitial lung disease. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged with associated pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Stable calcification of the aortic arch and descending
 aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interstitial opacities and worsened cardiomegaly likely consistent with
 mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  However, some interstitial disease could
 possibly be due to chronic lung disease such as ILD.
 2.  Small moderate pleural effusion.
 3.  Interval worsening of bibasilar atelectasis, left worse than right.
