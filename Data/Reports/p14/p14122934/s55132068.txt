                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, right rib pain, nonproductive cough, history of
 aortic stenosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the previous radiograph.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted along with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Additionally more
 focal opacity within the retrocardiac region is concerning for an area of
 pneumonia though atelectasis could have a similar appearance.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  There are multilevel mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Retrocardiac opacity may reflect pneumonia, though atelectasis may have a
 similar appearance.
