                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The small right lateral pneumothorax on chest CT of one day earlier is not
 apparent on the radiograph, but may be below the resolution of detection. 
 Consolidation involving portions of the right middle and right lower lobe have
 slightly progressed in the interval, and likely represent contusion in the
 setting of recent trauma, although aspiration is an additional consideration. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no substantial pleural effusions.
