                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fracture.  Preop evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are mildly hyperexpanded without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Opacity in the left upper lung could reflect overlap of the ___
 rib end, ___ posterior rib and scapula however this is newly apparent.  Heart
 and mediastinal contours are unremarkable with incomplete evaluation of
 thoracolumbar posterior fusion hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with left upper lung opacity,
 nodule versus superimposition of normal structures.  Consider apical lordotic
 radiographs on a nonemergent basis to further assess.
