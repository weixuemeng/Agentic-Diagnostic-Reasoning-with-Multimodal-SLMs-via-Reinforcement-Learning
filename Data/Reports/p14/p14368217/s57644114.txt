                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is
 tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration
 cannot be completely excluded. Blunting of the costophrenic angles on the
 lateral view suggests small bilateral pleural effusions. Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No pneumothorax is present. Multiple old
 left-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
