                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified although the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the
 field of view.  There are multilevel degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis
