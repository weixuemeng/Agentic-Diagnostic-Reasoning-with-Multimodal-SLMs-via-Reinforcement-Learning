                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left femoral embolectomy, here to evaluate for pulmonary
 consolidation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 21:30. Outside chest radiograph
 and CT abdomen of ___.
 
 Technique:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just below the
 thoracic inlet, 5.3 cm above the carina.  A left pectoral pacemaker is
 unchanged with a single lead terminating right ventricular apex.  A small to
 moderate left apical pneumothorax is unchanged from the outside chest
 radiograph and appears opacified by apical fluid on the most recent prior
 study.  There is interval increased opacification of the bilateral lung bases
 on the left greater than the right.  The left lingular and basilar
 opacification appears complex, corresponding to complex loculated
 penumathoraces and adjacent parenchymal opacities better seen on the outside
 CT.  Right basilar opacification likely reflects a combination of layering
 pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  The right border of the cardiac
 silhouette is normal in appearance.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in appropriate position. 
 
 2.  Small to moderate left apical pneumothorax unchanged from outside chest
 radiograph of ___.
 
 3.  Opacification of the lingular and left lung base corresponding to complex
 loculated hydropneumothoraces and adjacent parenchymal opacities better
 characterized on the outside CT.
 
 4.  Moderate right pleural effusion.
