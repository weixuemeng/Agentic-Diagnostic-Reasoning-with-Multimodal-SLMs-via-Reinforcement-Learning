                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 8 cm
 above the carina.  This has been subsequently advanced on a separately
 dictated radiograph from ___.  An area of homogeneous round opacity
 at the left apex is new, and likely represents shift of pleural fluid into a
 pre-existing left apical pneumothorax.  Moderate amount of pleural fluid is
 present on the left, including within loculated hydropneumothoraces at the
 left lung base, shown to better detail on recent outside CT. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present, as well as a layering small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. 
 Dense opacity in left retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.
