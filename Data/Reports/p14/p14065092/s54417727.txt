                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly increased when compared to the
 previous exam.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Fibronodular opacities within the lung apices persist, though
 there are least 2 new ill-defined nodular opacities noted within the right
 upper lobe.  Calcified granuloma within the left lower lobe, superior segment
 is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased nodular opacities within the right lung apex could reflect a
 superimposed process on a background of chronic granulomatous disease within
 the lung apices.  These processes could be infectious, inflammatory, or
 possibly neoplastic.  Chest CT is suggested for further assessment.
