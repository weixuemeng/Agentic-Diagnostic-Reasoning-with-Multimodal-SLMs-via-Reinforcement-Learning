                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  A band-like opacity projecting over the right
 upper lobe suggests minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacity suggesting minor atelectasis in the right upper
 lobe, otherwise unremarkable study.
