                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, myalgia, exclude lung infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes remain normal.  A
 pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has almost completely
 resolved.  On today's image, only a minimal band-like parenchymal opacity,
 obviously reflecting scarring, is visible.  No evidence of new pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
