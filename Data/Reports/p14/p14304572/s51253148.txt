                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypokinesis on TTE s/p aggressive fluid
 resuscitation, minimally improving despite diuresis  // Worsening pulm edema
 vs. ARDS vs. infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slightly improved aeration
 in the upper lung regions. Otherwise, the rather diffuse parenchymal
 opacities, with a slight lower lobe predominance, and air bronchograms, is not
 substantially changed. There is mild retrocardiac atelectasis but no pleural
 effusions are seen.  The findings are again suggestive of pulmonary edema,
 most likely based on capillary permeability.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
