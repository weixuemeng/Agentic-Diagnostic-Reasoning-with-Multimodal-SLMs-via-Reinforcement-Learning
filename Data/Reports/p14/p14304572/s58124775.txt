 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS.  // Any interval change in lung
 opacities? is ET tube appropriately placed?      Any interval change in lung
 opacities? is ET tube appropriat
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 08:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 2.8 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and side port projecting over
 the stomach. There continues to be bilateral diffuse airspace disease which
 appears slightly improved suggesting a component of superimposed edema in the
 setting of ARDS or a diffuse infection. Clinical correlation is advised.  No
 pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 diminished given semi-erect technique.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
