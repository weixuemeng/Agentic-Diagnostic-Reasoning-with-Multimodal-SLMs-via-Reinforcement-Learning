                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:55 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with thrombocytopenia and respiratory distress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung could represent
 pneumonia, but I suspect this is mild pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.  Findings
 have not changed appreciably since ___ on the right.  There is greater
 involvement in the left lower lobe today than previously.  Heart size is
 normal, though increased since ___, no other reason to suspect mild
 edema.  Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
