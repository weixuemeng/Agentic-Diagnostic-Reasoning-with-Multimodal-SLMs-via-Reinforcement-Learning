                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset hypoxia post-op with recent
 history of sick contacts, also has new cough  // pulmonary edema,
 consolidation, pneumonia, bronchitis?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive bilateral very
 diffuse pattern of parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, without
 substantial interstitial component and without the presence of pleural
 effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax. The symmetry of the
 changes as well as their rather centralized predominance would favor acute
 pulmonary edema.  On the other hand, the absence of an interstitial component
 would be more typical in infection.
