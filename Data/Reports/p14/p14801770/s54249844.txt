                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with high fever and productive cough; normal exam
 // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear and a wedge-shaped opacities are present in both juxta hilar regions,
 and appear to correspond to the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and
 superior segments of the lower lobes.  Subtle reticulonodular opacities are
 also present in the left perihilar region. Heart size is normal, and there is
 no definite mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is no pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal opacities in the juxta hilar regions, probably a combination of
 atelectasis and infectious consolidation in this patient with history of fever
 and cough.  Short-term followup radiographs are recommended in 4 weeks after
 completion of antibiotic therapy to document resolution and to exclude
 obstructing lesions or a non infectious process such as AB with PA.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 13:48 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
