 As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube and endotracheal
 tube are unchanged. The left lung base has increased in transparency, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation. At the left lung base, however, there is a
 new parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms, suggesting either developing
 pneumonia or aspiration.  No pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
