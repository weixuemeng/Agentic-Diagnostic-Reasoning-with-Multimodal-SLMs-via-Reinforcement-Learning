                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated with recent strep PNA, now with
 increasing secretions  // eval for interval improvement      eval for interval
 improvement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large area of greater opacification at the base of the right hemithorax is
 probably worsening atelectasis in the setting of persistently elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  Upright radiographs, particularly with a lateral view would be
 helpful in distinguishing between atelectasis and pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Atelectasis at the left base is mild.  Heart size is normal.
 ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric drainage tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view.
