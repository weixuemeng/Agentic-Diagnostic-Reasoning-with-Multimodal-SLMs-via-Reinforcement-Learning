                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NASH cirrhosis and confusion.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral upright chest radiographs demonstrates mild
 interstitial prominance with bibasilar right greater than left linear
 atelectasis and crowding of vasculature most prominent in the right lower
 lobe, which is unchanged since ___. No additional focal
 opacities.  Heart is mildly enlarged and unchanged from prior study.  No
 pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Unchanged heterogeneous bibasilar right greater than left opacities likely
 represent atelectasis; however, could represent infection or aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Mild vascular congestion.
