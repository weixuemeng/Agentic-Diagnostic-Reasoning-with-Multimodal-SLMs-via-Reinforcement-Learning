                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle right basilar opacity which appears slightly increased as compared to
 the prior study.  Findings could be due to atelectasis or aspiration; however,
 underlying infection is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due
 to trace pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There may be mild central pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Slight increase in right basilar opacity is non-specific but could be due
 to infection or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.  
 2.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
