 HISTORY:  Mild cough and altered mental status.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle posteriorly is chronic, likely reflecting mild pleural
 thickening.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.

 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
