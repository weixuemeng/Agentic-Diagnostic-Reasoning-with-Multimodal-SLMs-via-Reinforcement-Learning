                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal, lateral, AP upright chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased diffuse bilateral heterogeneous opacities with
 interstitial prominence and increased heart size is suggestive of mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion.  Heart may be partially large due to AP
 technique and patient rotation. Assessment of lower lungs is limited. Right
 basilar opacity is unchanged and may represent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. 
 Limited assessment of bones is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight increase in mild pulmonary edema.  No definite pneumonia.
