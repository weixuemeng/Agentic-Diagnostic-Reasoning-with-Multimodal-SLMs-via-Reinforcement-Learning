                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post partum with shortness of breath, evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There is a moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral patchy opacities. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles indicates probable bilateral pleural
 effusions, but could be confirmed with a lateral view.  These findings are
 consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary edema with possible small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
