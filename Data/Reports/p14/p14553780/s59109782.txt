                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stemi  // eval aorta contour
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged with a
 left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases most likely reflective
 of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected however
 the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected. A remote left mid clavicular fracture is re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
