                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Coronary disease and aortic stenosis presenting with tachypnea
 and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac borders are obscured, noting low lung volumes, but the heart
 appears probably enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. The aortic
 arch is calcified. The right hilum is enlarged which is suspected to reflect
 primarily enlargement of central pulmonary arteries. Diffuse opacification has
 increased.  The right lung base is better aerated but there is a persistent
 opacity at the left lung base, probably due to atelectasis. A background of
 moderate pulmonary edema appears somewhat worse.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Some worsening of pulmonary edema. Better aeration at the right lung base.
