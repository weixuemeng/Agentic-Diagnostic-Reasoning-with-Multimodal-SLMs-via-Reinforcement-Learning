                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent ST elevation myocardial infarction with possible
 aspiration of an end systolic heart failure, now presenting with respiratory
 distress and new leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is bilateral
 heterogeneous opacification which is again worse on the right than left but
 substantially improved, probably indicating improvement in background
 pulmonary edema. However patchy opacities persist and there is volume loss
 with persistent opacification at the lung bases, greater on the left than
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent opacity at the left lung base, with a configuration that is
 commonly due to atelectasis although pneumonia is not excluded. Improvement in
 diffuse lung opacification suggesting decreased fluid overload. However,
 differential considerations for persistent patchy asymmetric opacities include
 resolving alveolar edema or possibly pneumonia.
