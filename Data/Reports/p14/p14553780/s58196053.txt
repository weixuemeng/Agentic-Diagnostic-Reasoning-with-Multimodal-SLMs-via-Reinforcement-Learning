                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, perhaps
 minimally worse since the previous study.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 bilaterally is compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal
 opacity within the lung bases could reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes are seen within the
 glenohumeral joints bilaterally as well as diffusely throughout the thoracic
 spine.  Healed fracture deformity of the left mid clavicle is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions with probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.
