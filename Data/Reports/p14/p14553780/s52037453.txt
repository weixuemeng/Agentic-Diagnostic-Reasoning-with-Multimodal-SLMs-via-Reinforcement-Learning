 lines and tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 11:44.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous moderate pulmonary edema which worsened acutely on ___ has
 improved in the right upper lobe, and probably redistributed to the right
 lower lobe.
 
 Moderate atelectasis has developed in the left upper lobe.  This volume loss
 may explain the apparent change in size of the left hilus, but acute
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is possible.  Clinical correlation
 advised.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged following removal of the Impella
 device, and there is no pneumothorax, but a moderate left pleural effusion may
 be slightly larger.  .
