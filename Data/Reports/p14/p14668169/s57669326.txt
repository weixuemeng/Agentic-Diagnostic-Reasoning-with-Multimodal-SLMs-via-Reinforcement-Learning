                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of ETOH, SI, MIx___ s/p fall down ___ stairs p/w
 bifrontal SAH, L LeFort I and R Lefort II fxs, nondisplaced R humeral greater
 tuberosity fx.  // interval cxr     interval cxr
 
 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiograph ___ to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent heterogeneous consolidation at the right base is more likely slowly
 improving pneumonia than pulmonary contusion or atelectasis.  At the left base
 a much milder region of peribronchial infiltration has worsened. This could be
 recent aspiration.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no edema, pleural
 effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  Heart is normal size.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
