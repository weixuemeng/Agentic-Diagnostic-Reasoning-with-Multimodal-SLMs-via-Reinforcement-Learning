                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p unwittnessed fall down ___ stairs, +EtOH  // interval CXR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, the endotracheal tube has been
 slightly retracted, now terminating well above the level of the clavicles,
 approximately 9.8 cm above the carina.  This could be advanced several cm for
 standard positioning.  Side-port of nasogastric tube is proximal to the GE
 junction and could be advanced several cm.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 worsening opacity in the right middle and right lower lobes with associated
 volume loss.  This may reflect worsening atelectasis with or without
 coexisting aspiration or infectious consolidation.
