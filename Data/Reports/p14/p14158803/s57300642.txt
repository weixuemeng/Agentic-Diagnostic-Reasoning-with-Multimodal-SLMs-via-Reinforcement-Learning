                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F from ___ with known chronic lung infiltrate
 now with chest pain related to recent skin biopsy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Focal opacity in the left
 upper lobe with associated bronchiectasis is unchanged from the previous
 examination.  Streaky opacity within the right middle lobe correlates with
 areas of mucous plugging and small airways infection as seen on the previous
 study.  No new areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated. Other previously
 described nodular opacities noted diffusely within the lungs are better seen
 on the prior CT. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The lungs
 are hyperinflated. No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change compared to the previous CT. Unchanged focal
 area of opacification in the left upper lobe with bronchiectasis and streaky,
 patchy opacity in the right middle lobe which appears to correspond to the
 areas of mucous plugging with small airways infection on CT.  Other previously
 described widespread nodular opacities concerning for infection are better
 visualized on the CT.
