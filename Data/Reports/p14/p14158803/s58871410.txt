  Increased interstitial markings particularly in the left mid to upper lung
  with likely a chronic component given distortion of the left hilum.
  Superimposed acute infection or underlying mass lesion is also possible.
  Correlation with older films should they become available would be of use.
  Otherwise additional imaging such as followup chest x-ray after treatment (if
  planned) or CT scan at this time is suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ week h/o productive cough  // r/o
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 While there are increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, the most
 striking abnormality is an opacity in the left upper lobe extending to the
 periphery of the lung where there is also a pleural based opacity in the area.
 There is retraction of the hila suggesting a chronic component.  No pleural
 effusion is noted. No pneumothorax. Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta
 slightly unfolded.
 
 A 7 mm nodular opacity is noted in the right upper lobe projecting over the
 mid clavicle but is likely calcified; alternatively it may be a bone island.
 Attention on followup exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings particularly in the left mid to upper lung
 with likely a chronic component given distortion of the left hilum.
 Superimposed acute infection or underlying mass lesion is also possible.
 Correlation with older films should they become available would be of use.
 Otherwise additional imaging such as followup chest x-ray after treatment (if
 planned) or CT scan at this time is suggested.
