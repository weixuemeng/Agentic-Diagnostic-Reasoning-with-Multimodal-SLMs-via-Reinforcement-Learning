                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath and desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The left lung is
 relatively well expanded.  Increased opacity of the right lower lung is likely
 a combination of small to moderate size pleural effusion and consolidation. 
 Minimal retrocardiac opacity may also be present.  There is no pneumothorax or
 left pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal contours and heart size are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion with accompanying consolidative
 opacity.  Given the respiratory therapy note in the ED dashboard describing
 copious secretions, aspiration could be considered; however a right lower lobe
 pneumonia is an alternate consideration.  Minimal left basilar opacity could
 reflect multifocality of disease.
