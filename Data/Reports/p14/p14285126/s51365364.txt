                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with failure to thrive, endorses paroxysmal dyspnea,
 history of lung/esophageal  cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications and mild tortuosity.  The patient is status
 post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with similar appearance of the
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Fiducial marker is noted within a right
 apical lesion with surrounding opacity compatible with post treatment changes,
 better assessed on the prior CT and grossly unchanged.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated without new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  Hypertrophic changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Post thoracotomy changes of the right rib cage are again noted along
 with remote left-sided rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from recent chest CT.  Opacity about a fiducial
 marker in the right apex likely reflects post treatment changes.  Status post
 esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  No new focal consolidation.
