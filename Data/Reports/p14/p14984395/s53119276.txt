                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post thoracentesis.  Assess for pneumothorax. 
 
 Comparison was made with prior study ___.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There has been interval marked decrease
 in size in left pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly is stable and mild.  Widened
 mediastinum is unchanged.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has almost resolved. 
 Opacity in the right lower lobe is a combination of small pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be totally
 excluded.
 
 The hilum bilaterally are enlarged.  This could be due to lymphadenopathy.
 
 As mentioned before, CT of the chest with contrast is recommended to evaluate
 the mediastinum.
