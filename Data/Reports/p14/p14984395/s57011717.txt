 HISTORY:  Left effusion after Pleurx catheter, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a left Pleurx
 catheter at the base with decreased left effusion and improved lung aeration. 
 The hemidiaphragmatic contour is now relatively sharply seen.  
 
 There has been an increase in the amount of right effusion since the previous
 study.  The PICC line tip remains either at the cavoatrial junction or
 possibly in the upper portion of the right atrium.
