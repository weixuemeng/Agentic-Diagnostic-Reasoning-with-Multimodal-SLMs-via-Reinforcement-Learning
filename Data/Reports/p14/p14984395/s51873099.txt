                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post mediastinoscopy, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is not
 significantly changed.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as
 before.  A small left pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is no right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A linear lucency along the left
 heart border could be due to minimal pneumomediastinum or a medial left
 pneumothorax, not unexpected status post mediastinoscopy.  S-shaped scoliosis
 of the thoracolumbar spine is re-demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible minimal pneumomediastinum versus medial left pneumothorax. 
 Follow-up to resolution is recommended.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Possible tiny small left pleural effusion.
 
 Impression point #1 was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:56 p.m.
 via telephone on the day of the study.
