                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the left
 pleural effusion is constant.  Also constant is the minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic sinus.  However, on the right, better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal image, a new pleural effusion has occurred. 
 However, this effusion is limited to the costophrenic sinus.  No other
 changes.  The catheter projecting over the left lung base and left upper
 quadrant is constant.  Constant moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Constant position of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
