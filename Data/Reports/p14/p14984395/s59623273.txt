                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post mediastinoscopy with possible pneumomediastinum on
 prior chest radiograph.  The patient is clinically well, but repeating chest
 radiograph to assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 9:31 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As before, a right Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC.  Linear lucency
 along the left heart border seen on the prior radiograph from earlier today is
 less conspicuous on the present study.  There is minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis, not significantly changed.  A small left pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Previously seen lucency
 along the left heart border is less conspicuous on the present study.
 
 2.  Unchanged minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
