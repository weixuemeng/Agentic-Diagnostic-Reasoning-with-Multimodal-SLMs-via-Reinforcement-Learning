                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and tachypnea.  History of lymphoma and
 left-sided pleural effusion with Pleurx catheter placement.  Question acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava, as
 before.  A small-caliber chest tube is present on the left.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, including a moderate
 cardiomegaly.  There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, similar to
 perhaps somewhat increased on the right without definite change on the left. 
 Patchy basilar opacities have increased but appear streaky and suggest
 atelectasis associated with pleural effusions.  The bones are probably
 demineralized to some degree.  Moderate-to-severe scoliosis centered along the
 thoracolumbar junction, leftward convex at that site, appears unchanged with a
 more moderate rightward convex curvature centered along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably increasing but small to moderate pleural effusion on the
 right with similar left-sided pleural effusion.
