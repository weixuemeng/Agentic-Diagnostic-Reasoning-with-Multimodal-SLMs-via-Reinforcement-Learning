 Heart is now mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are
 engorged, suggesting volume overload or biventricular decompensation, but

 vasculitis and no pleural effusion is present.  Atrioventricular pacer leads
 follow their expected courses from the left pectoral pacemaker.  There is a
 remnant right lead, also ending in the right ventricle.
