                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are remarkable for tip of
 endotracheal tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Bilateral, asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities
 affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left, appear similar to
 the recent study, and could reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and
 pneumonia.  Moderate, apparently partially loculated right pleural effusion is
 also unchanged.
