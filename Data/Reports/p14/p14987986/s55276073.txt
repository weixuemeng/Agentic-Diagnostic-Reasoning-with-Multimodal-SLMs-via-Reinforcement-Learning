                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia, increased work of breathing, evaluation for
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, multiple new ECG cables are
 overlaying the patient and decrease in the image quality.  There is unchanged
 evidence of moderate pulmonary edema, associated with known multifocal
 pneumonia.  The transparency of the right upper lobe has increased, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Overall, however, lung volumes remained low.
 Moderate cardiomegaly, no larger pleural effusions.  No new focal parenchymal
 opacities.  Position of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are
 constant.
