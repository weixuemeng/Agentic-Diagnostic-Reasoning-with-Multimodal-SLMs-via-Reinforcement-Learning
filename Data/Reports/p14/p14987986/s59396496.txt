                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 17:43.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION ___-year-old with right-sided pneumonia, now with
 increasing oxygen requirement, question worsening infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:46.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 5:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacemaker in unchanged position.  Overall stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours given marked patient rotation to the left on the current
 examination.  Persistent patchy opacity in the right upper lobe consistent
 with pneumonia.  However, there is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature which suggests superimposed mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.
 No pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusions.
