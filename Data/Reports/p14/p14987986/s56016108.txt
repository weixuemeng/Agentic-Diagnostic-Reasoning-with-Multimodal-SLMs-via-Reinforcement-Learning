                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with Henoch-Schonlein purpura and IgA
 nephropathy found to have pleural effusion and cavity in the lung status post
 initiation of CVVH.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral
 cardiac pacer/AICD with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  An enteric tube extends inferiorly below the diaphragm and out of
 view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, likely accentuated by
 semi-upright position and AP technique.  Since one day ago, there is some
 improvement of right lower lobe aeration, although there is persistent
 multifocal pneumonia in bilateral lungs.  Cavitary pneumonia in the right
 upper lobe is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion on the
 left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild improvement of right lower lobe aeration.
