                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease and pneumonia, intubated.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The pacemaker leads terminate in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  An additional abandoned pacemaker lead
 is noted as well coming from the right subclavian vein.  The left internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The left PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC as well.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged as well as
 right lower and upper lung consolidations.  The left mid lung consolidation is
 better appreciated on the current study, since not obscured by the pacemaker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia.
