                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cavitary pneumonia and pleural effusion,
 here for interval change assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable left pectoral
 cardiac pacer/AICD with similarly distributed leads and unchanged Dobbhoff
 tube with weighted tip extending into the stomach.  A right internal jugular
 approach central venous catheter sheath demonstrates stable high positioning. 
 Large right pleural effusion is redemonstrated, with similar distribution of
 multifocal bilateral consolidations, which mask underlying cavitations seen on
 CT dated ___.  Stable perihilar vascular engorgement and
 cardiomediastinal prominence suggest a component of concurrent pulmonary
 edema.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall similar extent of multifocal consolidations in bilateral
 lungs and large right pleural effusion, likely with a concurrent component of
 pulmonary edema.  Cavitation is better delineated on recent prior CT.
