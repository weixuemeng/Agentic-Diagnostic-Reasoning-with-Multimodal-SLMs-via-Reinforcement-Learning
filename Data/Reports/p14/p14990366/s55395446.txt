                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with new NG tube colectomy, confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral ground-glass opacities sparing the right lung base have
 significantly improved.  It was probably secondary to asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Left lower lobe opacities, mostly due to atelectasis, are unchanged. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Right hilar region convexity is more pronounced today,
 of indeterminate significance.  It does not have the usual shape of lobar
 atelectasis, and without prior chest x-ray before the surgery, it is difficult
 to assess if it is chronic or acute.  There are some radiolucencies in this
 density.  The ET tube is in adequate position.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Unusual line is seen in left upper mediastinum, could be due to the projection
 only.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Patient with recent sigmoidectomy for diverticulosis.
 2.  NG tube is in adequate position.
 3.  Bilateral ground-glass opacities with sparing of right lower lung have
 improved and were probably secondary to atypical pulmonary edema.
 4.  Right dense hilum convexity is more pronounced today and is of unknown
 etiology.  It has an unusual shape for atelectasis.  Chest CT is suggested.
 
 Dr. ___ has been verbally contacted for the results.
