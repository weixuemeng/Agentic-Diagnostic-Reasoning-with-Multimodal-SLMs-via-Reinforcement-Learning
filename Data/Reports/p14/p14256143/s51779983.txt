 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever, shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Anchor screws are noted over the right
 humerus from presumed prior rotator cuff repair.  Degenerative change is also
 seen at the right shoulder, not fully imaged.  There appears to be narrowing
 of the space between the humeral head and the acromion.  Some degenerative
 changes are again seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
