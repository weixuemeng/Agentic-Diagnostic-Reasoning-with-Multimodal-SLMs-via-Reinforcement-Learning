                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with likely aspiration event, SDH, SAH, fever. 
 // etiology new oxygen requirement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Upper zone redistribution is again
 noted, but doubt overt CHF.  Patchy increased retrocardiac opacity is again
 seen, similar to prior, compatible left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base is more pronounced.
 Equivocal small left effusion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 raises question of a small right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially unchanged.  Minimal atelectasis and possible small right effusion
 are slightly more pronounced on today's examination.
