 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with malpositioned picc.  // please reassess
 post flush
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 15:38
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PICC line has been flushed.
 The tip of the line now projects over the cavoatrial junction. There is no
 evidence of complication. The opacity at the right lung bases persists. Very
 low lung volumes are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
