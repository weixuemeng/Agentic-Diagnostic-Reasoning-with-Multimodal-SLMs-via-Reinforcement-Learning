                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A left PICC has been removed.  There are two percutaneous transhepatic biliary
 drains identified in the right upper quadrant.  There is no right pleural
 effusion, and there is no opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 Left basilar volume loss is chronic.  There is a somewhat linear nodular
 density identified at the right apex, projecting between the posterior fourth
 and fifth ribs, not clearly apparent on prior studies.  This may be
 artifactual, though close attention to this area on followup examinations is
 recommended.
 
 The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or edema.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ at 2:30 p.m.
