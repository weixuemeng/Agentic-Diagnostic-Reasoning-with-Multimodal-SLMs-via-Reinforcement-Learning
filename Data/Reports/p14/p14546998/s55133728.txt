                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers and leukocytosis  // r/o pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are low, accentuating
 cardiomediastinal contours and resulting and crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  New patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are worse on the right
