                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a right juxtrahilar rounded 3.5 cm opacity, which may represent
 pneumonia or possibly a mass.  Opacities likely representing pneumonia are
 seen in the right middle lobe and the lingula.  There is no right pleural
 effusion.  The left costophrenic angles not included on this study.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The spleen
 appears to be slightly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacities in the right middle lobe and lingula, likely representing a
 multifocal pneumonia.
 
 2.  Right juxtahilar round 3.5 cm opacity, which may represent an additional
 site of pneumonia (e.g. round bacterial pneumonia, fungal infection or
 nocardia) or possibly a neoplastic mass.
 
 3. Short-term follow up CXR is recommended following antibiotic therapy to
 ensure resolution and to exclude right lung neoplasm.
