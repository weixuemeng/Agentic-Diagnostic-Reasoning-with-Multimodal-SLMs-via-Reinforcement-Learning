                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is again noted. Marked enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is similar. 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the previous study. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity
 within the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base, likely atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes. Infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
