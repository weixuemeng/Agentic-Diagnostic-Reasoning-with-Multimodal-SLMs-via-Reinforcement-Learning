 lobe heterogeneous opacity.  Tubular opacity in the left upper lobe is
 unchanged.  No interval change in small left pleural effusion and right upper
 thorax suture lines.  Heart size is partially obscured by the pleural
 parenchymal process.  Mediastinal contour is normal with a tortuous aorta.

 which may represent pneumonia, chronic inflammation or possible
 bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
