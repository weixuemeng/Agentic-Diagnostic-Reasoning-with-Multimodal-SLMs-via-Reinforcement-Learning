                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent chest x-ray or consolidation concerning for pulmonary
 hemorrhage, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ with additional reference chest x-ray
 from___ from ___.
 
 Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly with left
 ventricular configuration.  The aorta is calcified, tortuous and unfolded. 
 Doubt CHF.
 
 There is a large area of alveolar-type opacity in the right mid and lower
 zones, more pronounced medially and tapering laterally.  There is minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion. Tiny clip or
 calcification seen in the right lung laterally.  Chain sutures noted in the
 right upper lung. 
 
 There is some patchy opacity at the left base with slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, ? atelectasis versus small infiltrate.    Note is made of
 calcified atelectasis and/or scar in the left upper zone extending to the left
 upper chest wall and chain sutures at the left lung base medially. Tapering of
 the left sixth rib likely reflects postoperative change. ? also old, healed
 left-sided rib fractures.     Review of prior CT report refers to a
 lingulectomy.  
 
 A small nodular density is seen in the right mid zone measuring approximately
 6.8 mm, interposed in the mid axillary line between the right seventh and
 eighth ribs -- this has a correlate on a chest CT dated ___ (s7:im ___ of
 that exam).
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large opacity in the right mid and lower zones, similar versus slightly
 more pronounced compared with ___ and similar to the outside film from
 ___.  This was also seen on the ___ chest CT.  At that time, the CT
 report said that although pneumonia remains in the differential, this could
 reflect some chronic inflammation or lymphangitic spread.
 
 2.  Patchy opacity at left base with possible minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angle, slightly worse compared with ___, but improved
 compared with ___.  The differential diagnosis includes atelectasis or
 small nonspecific infiltrate.
 
 3.  Right midzone lung nodule. Please see reports of prior chest CTs which
 have raised concern for possible malignancy.
 
 4.  Scarring in the left suprahilar upper zone, presumably related to prior
 surgery.  
 
 5.  No new infiltrate identified.
