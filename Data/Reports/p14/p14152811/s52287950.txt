                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of lung cancer with
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, there
 has been significant interval improvement in the previously seen right lower
 lobe opacity with some persisten residual opacity in the superior segment of
 the right lower lobe.  Linear opacity in the left upper lung is unchanged. 
 There is more conspicuous patchy with somewhat linear components of opacity at
 the left lung base.  Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle may be
 due to pleural thickening or scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged denoting a tortuous thoracic aorta.  Post-thoracotomy changes are
 identified of the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of opacity in the right lower lung which
 still persists in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  Lingular
 linear and patchy opacities which are more conspicuous from prior.
