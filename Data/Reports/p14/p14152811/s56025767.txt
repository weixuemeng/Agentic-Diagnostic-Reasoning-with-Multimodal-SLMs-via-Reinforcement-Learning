 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing and known
 changes are still visible bilaterally.  The large perihilar scar on the left
 is not substantially changed.  Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta persist.  The predominantly alveolar opacity at the right lung
 base is slightly more extensive than on the previous image.  No other changes
 are noted.
