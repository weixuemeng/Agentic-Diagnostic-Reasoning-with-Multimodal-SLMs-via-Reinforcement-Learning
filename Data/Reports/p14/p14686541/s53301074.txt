                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and increased oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral view is suboptimal due to overlying arms.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is seen on lateral view, which may represent tiny pleural effusion or
 scarring.  Compared to prior exams, there is slight increased pulmonary
 vascular prominence, which may be predominantly technical.  Few bibasilar
 linear opacities may represent atelectasis.  Heart size is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Aortic calcifications are again noted.  Mitral annulus
 calcification is again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild increased pulmonary vascular prominence and
 possible tiny right pleural effusion.
