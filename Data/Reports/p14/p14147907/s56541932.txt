                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is the
 appearance of even further enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 relatively mild vascular congestion.  There is some increased opacification at
 the right base. Although this could merely reflect atelectatic change, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia must be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
