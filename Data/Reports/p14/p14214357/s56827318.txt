                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p right chest tube pull  // eval interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. No
 obvious right-sided pneumothorax. There is atelectasis at the right base and
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, slightly more pronounced
 than on the prior film.
 
 There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation slightly increased
 compared with the prior film. Curvilinear density is noted at the left lung
 apex, but the appearance is not conclusive for pneumothorax. Lateral view
 shows small bilateral effusions posteriorly.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Left subclavian PICC line again noted, tip over mid SVC.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No right apical pneumothorax status post removal of right chest tube.
 2. Small bilateral effusions seen posteriorly.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse.
 4. Doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
