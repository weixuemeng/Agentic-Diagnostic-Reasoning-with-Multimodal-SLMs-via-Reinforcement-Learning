 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral
 layering effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Again, the

 consolidation, though this would be difficult to detect given the extent of
 opacification in the lower portion of the lungs.
