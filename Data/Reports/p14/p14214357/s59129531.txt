                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Perforated hiatal hernia. Evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis from approximately 2.5 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a mildly
 enlarged cardiac silhouette.  There is a large mass overlying much of the
 cardiac silhouette and right lower lung, measuring ___.6 cm wide and consistent
 with the large hiatal hernia seen on prior CT. The trachea is deviated to the
 right with splaying of the mainstem bronchi. Pneumomediastinum is better seen
 in prior CT. No free air is seen higher in the neck. Intra-abdominal free air
 seen on prior CT is not appreciated on this exam.  The lungs are grossly
 clear, without a large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large mass overlying the lower lung, consistent with the large hiatal
 hernia seen on CT from the same day, with rightward deviation of the trachea
 and splaying of the mainstem bronchi.
 2. Limited evaluation of known pneumomediastinum. No free air is seen higher
 in the neck
