                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT 5:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with brainstem hemorrhage, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 21:31.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film, ___ at 5:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC
 near the cavoatrial junction.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not definitely identified.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation. 
 There is improving aeration in the retrocardiac region suggestive of resolving
 atelectasis, although resolving pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Interval extubation with slight reduction in lung volumes.  Crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema on the current
 study.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is
 diminished given semi-supine technique.
