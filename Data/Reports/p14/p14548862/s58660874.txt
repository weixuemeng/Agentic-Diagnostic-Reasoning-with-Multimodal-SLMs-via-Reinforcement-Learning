 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left upper quadrant pain and back pain after taking
 high-dose ibuprofen.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  There is slight prominence of the ascending
 aorta which appears more prominent compared to the prior study, although
 similar compared to chest radiograph from ___, which could be due to
 underlying tortuosity or mild dilatation of the ascending aorta.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Slight prominence of the
 ascending aorta could be due to tortuosity or mild dilatation of the ascending
 aorta and could be further evaluated on contrast-enhanced chest CT,
 non-emergently if has not been done previously.
