                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with neutropenic, dizzy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Mild widening of the right paratracheal stripe is compatible with
 underlying lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the previous CT, but appears
 improved.  There is minimal asymmetric fullness of the right hilum compared to
 the left, also likely reflective of underlying lymphadenopathy which has
 improved in the interval.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild widening of the right paratracheal stripe and fullness of the right hilum
 likely reflect underlying lymphadenopathy, improved compared to the previous
 PET-CT allowing for differences in modalities.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality otherwise noted.
