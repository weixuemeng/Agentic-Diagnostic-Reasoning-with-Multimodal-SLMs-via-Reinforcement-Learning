                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:45 chest radiograph and ___ CT torso
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with a left
 ventricular predominance.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted within a mildly tortuous aorta.  Low lung
 volumes are demonstrated with crowding of bronchovascular structures and mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the lung
 bases, more so on the left, and perhaps slightly progressed in the interval. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Remote fracture deformity of the right proximal
 humerus is again noted.  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar patchy opacities, more pronounced on the left, and
 perhaps slightly worse on the left in the interval.  These may reflect areas
 of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary
 edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
