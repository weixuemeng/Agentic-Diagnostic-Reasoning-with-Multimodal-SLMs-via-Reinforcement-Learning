                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ams  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 5.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below
 the field of view, side-port just past the GE junction.  Metallic density
 projects over the left hilum.  Additional bead like metallic density projects
 over the mid abdomen.  Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the
 lungs.  More dense opacity seen at the left lung base obscuring the descending
 thoracic aorta.  Hazy right basilar opacity is also noted.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but likely accentuated by technique.  No displaced
 fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.  Left greater
 than right basilar opacities could be atelectasis although infection or
 aspiration are not excluded.  Metallic densities, projecting over the left
 hilum, location indeterminate.  Apparent jewelry projects over the upper
 abdomen to be correlated clinically.
