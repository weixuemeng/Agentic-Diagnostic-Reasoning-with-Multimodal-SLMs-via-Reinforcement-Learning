 A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged position with
 the tip in the distal SVC.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position
 with the tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Heart remains stably
 enlarged.  The perihilar edema has improved.  However, there is persistent
 consolidation in the retrocardiac region likely representing lower lobe
 collapse in the setting of a small layering left effusion.
