 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are relatively
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Minimal left
 base atelectasis is seen which is less apparent on the second image.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 There may be minimal anterior wedging of a thoracic vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age.  Very minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion may be present.  There is gaseous distention of what appears to be
 the stomach under the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal
 consolidation seen.  Gaseous distention of what appears to be the stomach vs
 represent splenic flexure.  Correlate clinically.
