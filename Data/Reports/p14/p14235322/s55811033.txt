                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, somnolence  // eval for
 infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This exaggerates the cardiac silhouette size which
 appears mildly to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflects atelectasis given the presence
 of low lung volumes, but infection is difficult to exclude in the correct
 clinical setting.
