                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer including bilateral
 lower lobe lymphangitic spread now with fevers and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral extensive
 parenchymal abnormalities, which, when compared to chest radiographs dated ___, appear improved. These findings are consistent with known
 lympahngitis bilateral spread of malignancy.  There does not appear to be a
 new focal consolidation, though it is difficult to definitively rule out a
 pneumonia in the setting of bilateral opacities. Opacifications are worse when
 compared to film in ___, raising the question of recurrent pneumonia on
 today's examination.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable in
 appearance.  A left-sided subclavian port is seen with its terminal tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Extensive parenchymal abnormalities largely extensive metastatic carcinoma
 which appears mildly improved from ___ but worse when compared to
 Spetember ___ film, raising the possibility of recurrent pneumonia.
