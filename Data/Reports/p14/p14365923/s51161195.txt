                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with metastatic breast cancer on treatment, recent
 staging CT shows infiltrate in left lower lung and right middle lobe.  We went
 to see if we can follow this by chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.  There is no prior chest x-ray for
 comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right basal ground-glass and alveolar opacities are compatible with pneumonia
 as shown in recent CT.  Left lung is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath ends in lower SVC.  Mediastinal
 and cardiac contours are within normal limits.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Right lower lung opacities are consistent with pneumonia as shown in recent
 CT.
