                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and pleurex
 catheter on the right.  Evaluate lung fields bilat and compare to recent prior
 imaging.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall progression of findings compared to the prior exam. Increase in size
 of the known right pleural effusion, now large-to-moderate. New increased
 opacity in the left lingula and lower lung with a small left pleural effusion.
 It is unclear if right-sided lower lung opacities are also present given the
 concurrent right pleural effusion. Increased bilateral pulmonary vascular
 congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema. The right Pleur-ex catheter lies
 within the right hemithorax, although the precise location of tip cannot be
 ascertained.  No pneumothorax. Probable cardiomegaly, although the heart
 borders are obscured by the overlying pleural effusions. The port-A-Cath
 appears unchanged in position and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Progression of the known right pleural effusion, now large-to-moderate,
 and a new small left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  New, more prominent opacities in the left lingula and lower lung, which
 may be secondary to pulmonary edema.  However, some more unilateral appearance
 raises the possibility of superimposed consolidation.
 
 3.  Interval resolution of the right pneumothorax.
 
 4.  Pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 14:36 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
