                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided chest tube is again
 visualized. The tube has drained a previously extensive right pleural
 effusion.  At the site of tube insertion, at the basal and lateral aspect of
 the thorax, a minimal pneumothorax is seen.  There is an unchanged apical
 fluid component on the right. Finally, better visualized on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph, is a small remnant right pleural effusion.
 
 Unchanged right apical nodular density projecting over the third right rib. 
 Unchanged minimal scarring at the left lung apex.  The pre-existing
 parenchymal opacity at the left lung bases has substantially improved. The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
