                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of breast carcinoma with
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis, now presenting with increasing cough and
 worsening exertional dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Redemonstrated are diffuse basilar
 predominant reticular opacities within the right lower lobe, right middle
 lobe, and left lower lobe, findings consistent with history of lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis.  However, there is increased density involving the peripheral
 right lower lobe, right middle lobe and in the peripheral left lower lobe.  In
 the absence of infectious symptoms, these likely reflect progression of her
 metastatic disease, though superimposed pneumonia is possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion is identified.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left approach
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse basilar predominant reticular opacities with progressive
 increased density in the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower
 lobe.  In the absence of infectious symptoms, findings likely reflect
 progression of metastatic disease, correlate clinically.
