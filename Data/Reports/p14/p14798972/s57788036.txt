                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right port placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:08 p.m.:
 
 Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax has increased over the past five hours,
 now surrounds the entire right lung, previously basal.  New leftward
 mediastinal shift despite persistent right lower lobe collapse, which would be
 expected to move the mediastinum rightward, suggests the pneumothorax is
 accumulating under pressure.  Left lung grossly clear.  Heart size normal.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 6:45 p.m. on ___.
