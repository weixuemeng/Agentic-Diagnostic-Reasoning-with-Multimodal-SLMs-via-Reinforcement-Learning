                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette appears stable with expected widening
 of the right mediastinum due to the neoesophagus.  Right chest tube is in
 place.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  No appreciable pleural effusion
 is demonstrated as well although small amount of fluid cannot be excluded. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
