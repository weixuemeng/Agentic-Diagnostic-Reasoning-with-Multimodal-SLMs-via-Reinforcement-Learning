 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube has been repositioned or replaced, with tip now
 terminating at approximately the T10 vertebral body level, with the side port
 at approximately the T7 level with an intrathoracic neoesophagus in this
 patient status post esophagectomy.  Subcutaneous emphysema in right chest wall
 has slightly improved.  Lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the
 prior study with associated improved aeration at lung bases.  Otherwise, no
 relevant change.
