                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Esophagectomy with gastric pull-through.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right chest tube terminates in the stadnard position.  An,
 epidural catheter overlies the patient.  A nasoenteric tube terminates below
 the diaphragm.  Right perihilar opacity likely represents neoesophagus.  There
 is some subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral thorax.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and top
 normal heart size are consistent with recent surgery.
