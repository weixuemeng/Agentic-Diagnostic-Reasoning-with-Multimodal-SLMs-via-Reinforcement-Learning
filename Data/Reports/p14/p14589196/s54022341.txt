                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast cancer had a PICC line placed weeks
 ago, pre placement measurement was 47 cm, it was removed yesterday, and
 unfortunately measured at 44 cm.  Didn't look broken, however, the discrepancy
 remains. Likely the initial measurement was not correct, however needs CXR to
 evaluate. Thank you!  // Is there PICC line still in patient?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No evidence of retained PICC line.  Chronic elevation of left hemidiaphragm. 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion and mild left basilar atelectasis. 
 Interval resolution of right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The pleural surfaces are normal.  The
 spinal fusion hardware is intact.  Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No overt evidence of retained PICC line but a small fragment online in the
 lungs or heart would be better detected by chest CT than conventional
 radiographs.  If clinical concern remains, CT imaging would be recommended.
 2.  Interval resolution of right pleural effusion with persistence of left
 pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT imaging can be considered if concern remains for a
 fractured PICC line.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ ___ on
 ___ at 11:57 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
