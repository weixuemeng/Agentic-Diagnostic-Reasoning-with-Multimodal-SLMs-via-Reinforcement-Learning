 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PPM with HRs in the 30s  // assess for
 interval change in pacer- dislodgment?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:27 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, it appears as if the ventricular lead
 was pulled back. On the current image, the lead projects in a much more
 proximal location. However, it could still be located in the right ventricle. 
 For more precise assessment, an additional lateral view should be provided.
 The atrial lead is in unchanged position.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax, no
 pleural effusion.
