 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated.  Streaky and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect infection, atelectasis or possibly aspiration.  If there is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax.  Scarring within the lung
 apices is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.  Old
 right-sided rib fracture is again seen.

 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific, and may be in reflective
 of atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
