                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Evaluate possible bronchitis or pneumonia.  Cough and left lower
 lobe rales.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild hyperinflation is chronic.  Lungs are clear of any clinically significant
 focal abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable,
 including elevation of the pleural reflection crossing the aortic arch just
 below the thoracic inlet.  This bulge would give rise to some concern, except
 it has been stable since ___ and is therefore a benign condition, including
 mediastinal fat collection.  Smooth biapical pleural thickening, partially
 calcified on the right, is stable scarring.
