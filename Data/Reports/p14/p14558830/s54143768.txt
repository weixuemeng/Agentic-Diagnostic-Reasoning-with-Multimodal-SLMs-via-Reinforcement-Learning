                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pleural effusion.
 
 Comparisons made with prior CT of ___.
 
 There is a large right pleural effusion that has increased.  There is a change
 in the right perihilar opacity due to postradiation changes.  I cannot exclude
 the presence of a mass and CT should be performed for further evaluation. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe lung nodule is better seen
 in prior CT.  Left PICC tip is in the mid to lower SVC.  The sternal wires are
 aligned.  Cardiomediastinal contours are midline.  Cardiac size cannot be
 evaluated, is partially obscured by pleural parenchymal abnormality.  Patient
 is status post CABG and coronary stent.
