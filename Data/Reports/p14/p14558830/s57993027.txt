                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion after
 PleurX placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is still presence of right-sided loculated pleural effusion with minimal
 interval change, and unchanged overall position of the right PleurX catheter. 
 There is slight right mediastinal shift most likely due to underlying volume
 loss.  Left lung is essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  No focal
 consolidations have developed in the interim.
