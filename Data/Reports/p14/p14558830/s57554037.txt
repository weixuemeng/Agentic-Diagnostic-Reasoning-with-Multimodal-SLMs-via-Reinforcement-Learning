                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged deviated towards the right side. 
 Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has
 minimally increased.  The left lung is clear.  Right perihilar post-radiation
 changes are better seen in prior CT. The left lung is grossly clear.
 
 Persistent radiolucency medially in the lower right hemithorax likely
 corresponds to aereated lung medial to the atelectasis, but a small
 pneumothorax cannot be totally excluded.
