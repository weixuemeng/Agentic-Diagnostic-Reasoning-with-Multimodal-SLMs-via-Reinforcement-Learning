                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with lung cancer, right pleural effusion.  Assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Small right pleural effusion has minimally increased.  Aeration of the right
 middle lobe and right lower lobes has improved.  Rounded opacity in the right
 perihilar region is likely atelectasis.  Post-radiation changes in the right
 perihilar region are better seen in prior CT from a day earlier.  The left
 lung is clear.  Cardiac size is normal, partially obscured by the lung
 abnormalities.  Right basal chest tube remains in place.
