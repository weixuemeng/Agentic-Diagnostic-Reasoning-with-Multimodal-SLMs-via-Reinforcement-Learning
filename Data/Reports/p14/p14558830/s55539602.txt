 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with lung cancer status post PleurX placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 There has been interval decrease in a small right pleural effusion.  There is
 no evident pneumothorax.  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectases
 have improved.  Right perihilar postradiation changes are better seen in prior
 CT from earlier in the same day.  The left lung is clear.  Cardiac size is
 obscured by the parenchymal abnormalities.  Right basal chest tube remains in
 place.
