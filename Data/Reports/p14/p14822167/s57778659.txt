                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man ? 2.4 cm rounded opacity  on pre-op x-ray  //
 Assess for ? 2.4 cm rounded opacity noted on pre-op x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the 2.5 cm rounded opacity, projecting
 over the right costophrenic sinus, is in unchanged position and of unchanged
 morphology.  The structure could represent a slightly enlarged ventral part of
 the sixth right rib.  However, to exclude a neoplastic lesion, the current
 imaging should be complemented with a lateral radiograph and, potentially, a
 CT.
