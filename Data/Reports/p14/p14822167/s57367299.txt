                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post fall with open foot fracture. 
 Preoperative assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 demonstrated.  2.4 cm rounded opacity projecting over the lateral aspect of
 the right lung base may reflect a nipple shadow.  Atelectasis in the right
 lung base is present.  The left lung is clear.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  No displaced
 fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. 2.4 cm rounded opacity projecting over the lateral aspect of the right lung
 base may reflect a nipple shadow.  Repeat radiographs with nipple markers are
 recommended for further assessment.
 2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown acuity with right basilar
 atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiographs with nipple markers are recommended for
 further assessment.
