                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.  Chest CT
 available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  In comparison to the most recent
 available chest radiograph from ___, a new vague left midlung
 zone opacity is present, not well localized on the lateral view, which may
 denote focal atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but a small
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Again seen is a background of coarse
 interstitial markings which are minimally changed.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours remain stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Vague left midlung opacity which may represent a small consolidation. 
 Chest CTA is pending at the time of interpretation. 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
