                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation for interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has mildly increased.  There is unchanged tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Increased perihilar haziness and overall number of
 interstitial markings.  In addition, there is minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, caused by a small pleural effusion.  Overall, the findings
 are rather suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema than of interstitial
 lung disease.  The interstitium should be reassessed after diuresis.
 
 No reduction in lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.  At the time of
 observation and dictation, 05:10 p.m. on ___, the referring
 physician, ___. ___, was notified by Dr. ___.
