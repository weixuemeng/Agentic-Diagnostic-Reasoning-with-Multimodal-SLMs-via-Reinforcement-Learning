                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Preop evaluation.  Patient with lower extremity vascular
 disease.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Pacemaker leads are in standard position.  Left lower lobe
 opacities are likely atelectasis.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There
 is no pneumothorax or large effusions.
