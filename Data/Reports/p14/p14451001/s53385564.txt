  An enteric tube terminates either within the distal stomach or proximal small
  bowel.  Mildly increased opacity bilaterally suggestive of pulmonary edema.  A
  larger caliber tube projecting to the left of the trachea is noted.  After
  discussion with the MICU resident, this likely reflects the external portion
  of the enteric tube.  The patient has been extubated.
