                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure, ETT advanced today  // eval
 ETT repositioning
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 03:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, the
 endotracheal tube has been advanced, and now terminates 4.8 cm above the
 carina.  Enteric tube terminates in the superior fundus of the stomach.  Right
 central venous catheter introducer sheath terminates in the mid SVC.  Adjacent
 right-sided PICC also terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals multifocal patchy opacities likely
 representing underlying infectious process.  This has progressed from the most
 recent chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, and suggests a
 component of underlying vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube terminating 4.8 cm above
 the carina.
 2. Apparent worsening of multifocal opacities, presumably pneumonia, since
 several hours earlier, suggesting that there may be a component of vascular
 congestion.
