                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCV/ETOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, admitted
 with partial SBP, now with fever to 103  // ? pneumonia     ? pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower
 lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is
 engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  An ill -defined area of opacification is again
 seen adjacent to the left heart border that could represent a focus of
 consolidation.  There is also more coalescent areas of opacification at the
 bases.  Although this could represent merely vascular congestion or
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting the possibility of
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
