                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory distress  // Interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, bilateral symmetric
 airspace opacities have worsened, particularly in the left mid lung and right
 lower lung, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia, though pulmonary edema,
 ARDS and alveolar hemorrhage cannot be definitively excluded. Possible
 loculated left pleural effusion along the periphery of the left lower
 hemithorax is difficult to assess, though does not appear to be significantly
 worse.  No other relevant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval worsening of bilateral symmetric airspace opacities, most
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Loculated left pleural effusion, likely unchanged.
