                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and altered mental status s/p
 intubation, readjusted ETT  // please eval ETT placement (repositioned)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph from earlier today, an endotracheal tube is been
 advanced, now terminating 7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube has also
 been advanced, but side port is still proximal to the GE junction level.  Exam
 is otherwise remarkable for new heterogeneous opacities in the right lower
 lobe, potentially due to acute aspiration event and less likely asymmetrical
 edema.
