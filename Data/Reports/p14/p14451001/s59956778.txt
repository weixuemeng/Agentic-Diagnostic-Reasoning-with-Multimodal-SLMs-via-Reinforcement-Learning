                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with anemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires and
 multiple clips in the left upper abdomen are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen within the left mid and lower
 lung fields, as well as streaky right basilar opacity, findings unchanged from
 prior, and likely reflective of slowly resolving pneumonia.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study.  Minimal patchy bibasilar
 opacities, more pronounced on the left, are unchanged, likely reflective of
 slowly resolving infection.
