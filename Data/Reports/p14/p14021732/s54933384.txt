                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain with fall over anterior rib.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the appearance of the heart and lungs.  No definite evidence of rib fracture,
 though oblique views could be obtained if this is a serious clinical concern. 
 No pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectatic changes at the bases in a patient with
 hyperexpansion consistent with some chronic pulmonary disease.  Wedging of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body is seen, most likely representing a chronic
 process.
