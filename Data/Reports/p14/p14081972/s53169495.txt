                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with cardiac aneurysm, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent, with some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart, presumably related to the low lung volumes. 
 There has been interval placement of a left subclavian pacer, with its tip in
 the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
 
 No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note is an old healed fracture of the mid portion of the right
 clavicle.
