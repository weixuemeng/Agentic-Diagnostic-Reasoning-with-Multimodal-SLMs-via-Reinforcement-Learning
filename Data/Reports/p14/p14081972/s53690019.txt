                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TIA versus seizures, now with lung crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there are relatively low lung volumes, which may accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  The pacer wire again extends to the region of the apex
 of the right ventricle.  There is no evidence of vascular congestion or acute
 focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note is the old healed fracture of the mid portion of the right
 clavicle.
