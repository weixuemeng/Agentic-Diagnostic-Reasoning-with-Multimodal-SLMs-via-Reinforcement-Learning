                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, cough x 10 days  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  There
 is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta, as on prior exams.  Patchy airspace
 opacity in the right lower lung likely relate to a suboptimal inspiratory
 effort in the setting of low lung volumes, however developing infection should
 be considered in the correct clinical setting.  There is no evidence of focal
 lung consolidation elsewhere.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lung airspace opacity likely due to a suboptimal
 inspiratory effort.  Early infection cannot be excluded, recommend attention
 on followup.
