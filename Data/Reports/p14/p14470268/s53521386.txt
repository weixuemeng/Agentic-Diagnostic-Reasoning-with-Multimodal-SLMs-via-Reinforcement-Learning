                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, cough  // please evaluate for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality reflected both in linear
 opacities and in mild bronchial cuffing, but I doubt that this is acute. Very
 slight increase in radiodensity in the left midlung has been present for some
 time.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement.
