                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is mild diffuse increase in interstitial markings which may be due to
 mild interstitial edema.  Relative confluent opacity projecting over the left
 mid-to-lower lung raises concern for infection or aspiration.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
