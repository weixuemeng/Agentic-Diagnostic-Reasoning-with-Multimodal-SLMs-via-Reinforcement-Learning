 above the carina.  A right IJ central line tip terminates above the cavoatrial
 junction. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Opacities in the bilateral lung
 bases may represent a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions,
 however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. The heart
 remains mildly enlarged.
