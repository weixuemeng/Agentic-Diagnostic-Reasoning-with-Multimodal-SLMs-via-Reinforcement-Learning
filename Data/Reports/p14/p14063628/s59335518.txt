  1. The tip of the new right IJ central line is seen terminating in the right
  atrium.  Recommend retraction for optimal positioning.
  2.  Otherwise, stable appearance of cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, dense
  bibasilar opacities, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and small
  pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p right IJ placement, please eval placement  // ___F s/p
 right IJ placement, please eval placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Enteric tube the seen coursing into the stomach and
 continues out of view.  An ETT is seen terminating 3.4 cm above the carina.  A
 right IJ central line tip terminates in the right atrium.  Mild pulmonary
 edema is unchanged.  Opacities in the bilateral lung bases may represent a
 combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions, however, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  The heart remains mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The tip of the new right IJ central line is seen terminating in the right
 atrium.  Recommend retraction for optimal positioning.
 2.  Otherwise, stable appearance of cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, and
 dense bibasilar opacities, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and
 small pleural effusions, stable since prior exam.
