                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sepsis/ abdominal pain POD1 from 
 cholecystectomy// Eval for bile leak/collection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The
 mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  There is likely mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No definite subdiaphragmatic free air is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Clips and common bile duct
 stent are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary
 edema.
