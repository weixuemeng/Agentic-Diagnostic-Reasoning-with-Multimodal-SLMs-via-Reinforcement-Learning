                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but infection is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
