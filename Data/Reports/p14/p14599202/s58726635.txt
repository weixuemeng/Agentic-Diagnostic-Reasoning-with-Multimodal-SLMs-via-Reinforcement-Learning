                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is
 considerably increased opacification in the posterior right lower hemithorax
 which is at least in part likely to reflect a pleural effusion but probably
 also substantial atelectasis or consolidation involving basilar parts of the
 right lower lobe. The right hemidiaphragm is modeately elevated.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity is probably due minor atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased posterior right basilar opacities suggesting a pleural effusion with
 coinciding atelectasis versus consolidation.
