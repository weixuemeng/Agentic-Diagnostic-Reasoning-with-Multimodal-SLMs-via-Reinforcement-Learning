 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right MCA stroke and worsening oxygen

 change?     interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Some of the apparent improvement in severe multi focal consolidation over the
 past 2 days is due to decreasing moderate right pleural effusion, the rest is
 due to genuine clearing of the consolidation, that still persists throughout
 the right lung and on the left at the apex. Borderline cardiomegaly is stable.
 Left pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube and esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
