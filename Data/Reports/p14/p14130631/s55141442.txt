 minor fissure and along the right apex. Accounting for decreased inspiratory
 volume in current study, bilateral airspace opacities are unchanged, right
 greater than left. There is unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 consistent with effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

 Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral airspace opacities, right
