                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pleural effusion, status post Pleurx, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval, a left pleural catheter has been introduced.  The
 catheter is in correct position.  There is a near total evacuation of the
 pre-existing left pleural effusion.  Only a minimal remnant effusion in the
 region of the costophrenic sinus remains.  On the right, extensive effusion
 and opacities are unchanged.  No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities in
 the imaged ventilated lung areas.
