  IMPRESSION:

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with right juxtahilar pulmonary
 metastasis with new onset hemoptysis or hematemesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Multiple chest radiographs from
 ___ to ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is near total opacification of the right
 lung due to tumor mass and surrounding pleural effusion.  Compared to
 ___, there is minimally improved aeration of the lower right lung.  The
 small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  The left lower lobe lung features
 lymphovascular markings with tiny nodules consistent with lymphovascular
 carcinomatosis better appreciated on the CT.  There is stable rightward
 deviation of the trachea and undermines the nonvisible extent of the hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimally improved right lung aeration in the presence of juxtahilar tumor
 and pleural effusion.
 2.  Evidence of lymphovascular carcinomatosis of the left lower lung and
 stable small pleural effusion.
 3.  No evidence of pneumonia.
