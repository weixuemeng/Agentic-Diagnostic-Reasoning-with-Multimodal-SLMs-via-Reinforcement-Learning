                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  MRSA endocarditis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___ chest x-ray and CT from
 ___.
 
 Large bilateral effusions have increased on the left.  Pulmonary edema now
 moderate-to-severe has worsened.  Asymmetric left perihilar opacity and
 opacity in the left upper lobe could be due to asymmetric edema, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 position.
