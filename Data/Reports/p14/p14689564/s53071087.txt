                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after an MVR, with MRSA endocarditis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right PIC line has migrated from the right atrium to the upper SVC via a loop
 in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Careful withdrawal of 3.5 cm might reduce
 that loop and still leave the tip in the mid SVC.  In a similar vein, the
 feeding tube is looped several times in the upper stomach.
 
 Previous vascular congestion has resolved.  No findings of heart failure. 
 Heart is normal size.  Opacification in the right lower chest could be either
 a posteriorly collected pleural effusion or severe right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  On the left, the appearance suggests both, but the volume of
 pleural fluid on each side is less today than it was on ___ when the
 last chest radiograph was taken.
 
 Dr ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone.
