                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, reported diagnosis of
 pneumonia at a clinic, comparison film not available  // eval heart and lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally, suggesting
 vascular congestion cyst, mild edema. No definite focal consolidation is seen.
 Bibasilar opacities likely relate to fluid overload, and are symmetric
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting infectious process not entirely
 excluded but felt less likely. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of
 the diaphragms. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings bilaterally
 suggests fluid overload. Bibasilar opacities are symmetric and felt to more
 likely relate to fluid overload or chronic lung disease rather than infection
 although infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
