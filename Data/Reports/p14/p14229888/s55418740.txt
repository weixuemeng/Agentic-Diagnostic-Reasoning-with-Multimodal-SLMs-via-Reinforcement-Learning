                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dementia, AMS and fatigue for one day.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable aside from mild unfolding of the descending aorta.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  Lungs are mildly hypoinflated, but
 clear, without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Note is made of
 a left axillary dual-lead pacemaker with tips terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle as expected.  Compression deformities of two upper lumbar
 vertebral bodies are noted on the lateral view with prior vertebroplasties. 
 Mild loss in height among two upper thoracic vertebral bodies is probably
 chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
