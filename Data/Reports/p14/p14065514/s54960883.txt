                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Esophageal cancer, removal of masses, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pectoral
 Port-A-Cath has been removed.  There is unchanged evidence of right perihilar
 surgical intervention with clips and hilar enlargement.  This is consistent
 with history of esophageal cancer.  The current radiograph shows no acute
 changes, in particular, no evidence of pleural effusions or nodular or
 mass-like opacities.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
