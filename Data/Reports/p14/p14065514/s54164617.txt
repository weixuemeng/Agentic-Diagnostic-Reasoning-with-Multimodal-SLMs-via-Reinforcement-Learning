                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___, chest radiograph ___, CT
 abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  The cardiac silhouette size
 is normal.  The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through
 with unchanged mediastinal contour. The hilar contours are also stable.  Small
 right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally is not
 significantly changed from the prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis, but may be
 slightly improved compared to the prior chest radiograph.  Small left-sided
 pleural effusion also likely persists.  Minimal streaky right basilar opacity
 likely reflects atelectasis, subjacent to the effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, partially loculated on the right, not
 significantly changed from the recent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  Adjacent
 right basilar streaky opacity most likely reflects atelectasis.
