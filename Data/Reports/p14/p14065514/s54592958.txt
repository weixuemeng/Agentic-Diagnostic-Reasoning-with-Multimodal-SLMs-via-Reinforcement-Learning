                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer, nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric
 pull-through at, with no significant interval change in the appearance of the
 mediastinum compared to the prior radiograph.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable, with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, suggestive of a trace effusion, but
 no pneumothorax is identified.  Left lung is clear.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus suggests a trace pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise
 identified.  No free air under the diaphragms identified.
