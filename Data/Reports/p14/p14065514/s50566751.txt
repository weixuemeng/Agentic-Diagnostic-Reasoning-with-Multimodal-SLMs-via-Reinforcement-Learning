                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and shortness of breath.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Right chest wall port is again seen.  Previously
 identified right apical pneumothorax is no longer seen.  Low lung volumes are
 noted.  Right basilar linear opacities have partially cleared.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear, noting blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle,
 unchanged, potentially due to scarring or small effusion.  Prominent soft
 tissue density in the region of the right paratracheal stripe inferiorly is
 again noted, potentially related to postoperative changes of gastric
 pull-through.
 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Improved aeration at
 the right lung base compared to prior.  Previously seen right apical
 pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
