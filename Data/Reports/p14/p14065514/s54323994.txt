                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumothorax followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:33 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right small pneumothorax has slightly improved from ___.5 to ___.7 mm.  An
 air-fluid level is seen in the right basal pleura.  Air overlying the right
 mediastinum is probably compatible with a gastic pull up in this patient with
 esophageal cancer.  Bibasal atelectasis is slightly improved.  Left lung is
 unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Right small pneumothorax has slightly improved.
