                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post esophagectomy six days ago,
 evaluate for pneumothorax after CT removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view
 chest examination obtained four hours earlier during the same day.  On the
 present examination, the apical right-sided pneumothorax has increased in size
 and measures now 2 to 3 cm in width surrounding the apical area.  No marked
 decrease in lung volume and no new pulmonary infiltrates are identified.  The
 right-sided Port-A-Cath system remains in unchanged position.  No new
 pulmonary abnormalities or pneumothorax in the left hemithorax. Lateral view
 discloses that the pneumothorax separation reaches also anteriorly as well as
 posteriorly terminating with a small loculated air-fluid level at the level of
 the eighth vertebral body of the thoracic spine as seen on the lateral view. 
 No other new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities are identified.  There exists
 moderate gas distension of the bowel pull-through in the right-sided
 mediastinal area.
 
 Increase in right-sided pneumothorax was observed and immediately submitted
 via page to ___ at 3:45 p.m.
