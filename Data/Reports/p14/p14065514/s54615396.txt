                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer, productive cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC.  Cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged with evidence of prior esophagectomy and
 gastric pull-through.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Persistent
 small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left are again noted,
 with the amount of fluid loculated laterally on the right decreased compared
 to the prior study.  Previously noted right basilar atelectasis subjacent to
 the partially loculated pleural effusion appears improved.  No new focal areas
 of consolidation are present.  No pneumothorax is present in the osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, with slight interval decrease in
 the amount of loculated fluid laterally on the right and improvement in
 aeration of the right lung base.
