                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of severe left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Please
 evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new small left pleural effusion compared to the prior
 study.  There appears to be an adjacent opacification.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New left small pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation likely secondary
 to compressive atelectasis; however, an infection must be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Furthermore, if there is clinical concern for pulmonary embolus, a CTA of the
 chest is recommended for further evaluation, as pulmonary embolus cannot be
 excluded by this study.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 3p on
 the day of the exam.
