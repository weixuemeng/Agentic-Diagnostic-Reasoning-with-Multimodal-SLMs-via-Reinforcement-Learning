                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of CLL, renal cell cancer, status
 post cyclophosphamide with right lung Pleurx for recurrent effusions,
 presenting with shortness of breath and found to have right-sided empyema,
 status post drainage, now off drain, evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The right PICC tip terminates in the mid
 SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, worse on the left, stable
 on the right.  Emphysematic changes are noted in the soft tissues along the
 right lateral hemithorax, unchanged from the prior examination.  Minimal
 airspace opacification, particularly along the right lung base may represent
 layering pleural effusion; however, worsening atelectasis or underlying
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC tip appears to be in the mid SVC.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left and stable on the right
 compared to the most recent prior examination.
 3.  Increased airspace opacifications, particularly at the right lung base may
 represent worsening atelectasis, layering pleural effusion; however,
 underlying infectious process cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
 4.  Surgical emphysematic changes in the soft tissues along the right
 hemithorax, unchanged from the prior examination.
