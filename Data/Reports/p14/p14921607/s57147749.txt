                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of recurrent right pleural
 effusion status post thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been marked improvement in previously visualized moderate
 pleural effusion on the right with a small pleural effusion persisting.  There
 is also a small left pleural effusion. 
 
 Otherwise, mild bibasilar atelectatic changes are again visualized but the
 lungs are without any focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine along with demineralized osseous structures appear stable. 
 Post-surgical changes are visualized with surgical clips overlying the left
 hemiabdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Marked decrease in right effusion following thoracentesis with no
 pneumothorax.
