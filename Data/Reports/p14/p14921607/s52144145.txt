                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion, left Pleurx catheter, assessment for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal pleural effusion on
 the left with subsequent atelectasis.  The effusion is better seen on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  On the right, the pre-existing
 pleural effusion has decreased in extent, also decreased is the apical lateral
 portion of the effusion that was obviously loculated.  Despite improvement,
 effusion is still seen at the right lung base and combined with areas of
 atelectasis.  The prexisting right paramediastinal widening, obviously caused
 by a combination of lymphadenopathy and, potentially, posterior encapsulated
 pleural effusion, is better visible than on the previous radiograph.  CT could
 provide a better delineation of these changes.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
