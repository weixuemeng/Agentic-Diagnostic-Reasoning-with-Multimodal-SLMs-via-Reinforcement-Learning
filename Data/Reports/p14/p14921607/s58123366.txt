                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___-year-old woman with crackles halfway up the right base.  Question effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Subcutanous air
 has resolved. There is a larger, moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.
 Right pleural effusion hsd decreased in size. Upper lungs are clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be evaluated secondary to pleural
 effusion.  
 
 Of note, the supra-hilar region of the right mediastinum appears somewhat
 fuller than prior radiographs. This is suspicious for adenopathy in a patient
 with known malignancy. 
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via
 telephone at 11:50 a.m. at the time of the discovery.
