                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of malignant right pleural effusion
 status post talc pleurodesis on ___.  Patient now with right rib pain after
 thoracentesis today.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and recent portable chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right apical chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Post-pleurodesis changes in the right
 lung base appear unchanged compared to recent prior examinations. 
 Subcutaneous air within the soft tissues of the right chest wall has decreased
 in the interval.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle similar to
 prior, suggestive of a chronic small left effusion.  A small amount of fluid
 is seen layering in the minor fissure.  Bibasilar atelectasis is probable. 
 The upper and mid lungs appear clear.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or
 overt edema is identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The heart size may be minimally increased, possibly due to a new
 pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Post-procedural changes from recent right pleurodesis.  Decreased
 subcutaneous air in the right chest wall.
 2.  Unchanged position of right apical chest tube.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 4.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
 5.  Mild increase in cardiac size could reflect developing pericardial
 effusion.
