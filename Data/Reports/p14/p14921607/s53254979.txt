                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath status post left thoracentesis, question
 pneumothorax, change in left effusion.
 
 CHEST, 1 VW
 
 
 Compared with ___ at 23:22 p.m., the right-sided catheter is unchanged.
 There is a curvilinear contour projecting over the right third rib medially. 
 No definite pneumothorax.  Vessels can be seen coursing above this curvilinear
 contour, suggesting it is related to skin fold.  
 
 Compared with the prior study, there are markedly increased interstitial
 markings throughout the right lung.  A small-to-moderate right effusion is
 unchanged, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The subcutaneous
 emphysema along the right chest wall is unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette is
 probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences.  The left lung is
 grossly clear, except for a small left pleural effusion and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation -- this similar or slightly less compared with
 the ___ film.  In the left lung, the vessels appear attenuated, which could
 reflect some background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Marked interval worsening of increased interstitial markings in the right
 lung.  Given the rapid time course, this suggests asymmetric interstitial
 edema.  However, the differential diagnosis could include rapid accumulation
 of lymphedema or, alternatively, an interstitial and infectious infiltrate.  
 
 2) Small-to-moderate right and small left effusions, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  
 
 3) Unusual curvilinear interface at right lung apex, without definite
 pneumothorax.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No
 left-sided pneumothorax detected.
