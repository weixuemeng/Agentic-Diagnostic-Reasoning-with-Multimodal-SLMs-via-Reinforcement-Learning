 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pleural effusion has nearly completely resolved following
 reported placement of Pleurx catheter.  The catheter is not well visualized
 radiographically.  There is likely a very tiny left apical pneumothorax
 present.  In association with reduction in volume of the left pleural
 effusion, improved aeration of the lingula and left lower lobe are
 demonstrated with residual minor atelectasis.  On the right, a moderate to
 large multiloculated pleural effusion has increased in size, however. 
 Apparent widening of right mediastinal contours is likely a combination of
 medially loculated pleural effusion and known underlying lymphadenopathy on
 prior CT.
