                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following large volume right thoracentesis, a small right
 pneumothorax has developed at the apex, as well as loculated
 hydropneumothoraces at the right base laterally.  The right lung has
 re-expanded, but note is made of poorly defined opacities in the perihilar and
 basilar regions, likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema following
 large-volume thoracentesis.  Minimal poorly defined opacities persist at the
 left lung base, and note is made of a probable small persistent left pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pneumothorax following thoracentesis, as well as
 probable mild re-expansion pulmonary edema.  Pneumothorax has been
 communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 4:15 p.m.
