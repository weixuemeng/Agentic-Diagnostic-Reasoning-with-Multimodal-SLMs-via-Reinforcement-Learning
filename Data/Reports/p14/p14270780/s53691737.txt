                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, with interval mild decrease in a left pleural
 effusion.  Left base atelectasis is likely related to a combination of pleural
 effusion and resultant atelectasis.  There is no new focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval mild decrease in a left pleural effusion, with retrocardiac opacity
 likely atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 right clinical setting.
