                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman NASH cirrhosis with dyspnea  // acute
 intrathoracic process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 08:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen left pigtail catheter is no longer visualized.  There has
 been interval accumulation of a small to moderate size left pleural effusion
 with some degree of underlying collapse and/or consolidation, though there is
 relative translucency of the left lung base itself.  Air bronchograms are seen
 in the retrocardiac region.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right base, but, in the right lung, no focal infiltrate,
 consolidation, or effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung base pigtail catheter no longer visualized.  Interval development of
 small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 If clinically desired, a left-side-down decubitus view a help to better
 quantify the amount of pleural fluid.
