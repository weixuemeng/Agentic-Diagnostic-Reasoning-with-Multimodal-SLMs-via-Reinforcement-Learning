 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Apparent interval enlargement of the
 heart may be due to differences in technique.  Left lung base opacity is
 unchanged and consistent with a fat pad.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body and
 endplate sclerosis of upper thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Apparent increased size of the cardiac
 silhouette is likely due to differences in technique.
