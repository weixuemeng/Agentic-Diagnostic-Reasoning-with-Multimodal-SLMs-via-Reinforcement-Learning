                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen involving the aortic knob.  There is
 moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  There is likely a
 moderate-sized hiatal hernia accounting for the lucency projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette.  Interstitial opacities within the lung bases may reflect
 an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is grossly noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with probable trace bilateral pleural effusions,
 potentially superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease.
 Moderate size hiatal hernia.
