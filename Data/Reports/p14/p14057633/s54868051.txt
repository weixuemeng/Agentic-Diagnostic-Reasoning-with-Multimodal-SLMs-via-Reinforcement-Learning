                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pacer, check placement.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A dual-lead left-sided pacer device is in place with the leads terminating
 over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle,
 respectively.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within
 normal limits given portable technique and patient rotation.  Lungs appear
 well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pneumothorax,
 pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.
