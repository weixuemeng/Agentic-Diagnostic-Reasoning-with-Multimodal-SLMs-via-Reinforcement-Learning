                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with large epidural hematoma, intubated, with
 known PNA  // please evaluate for interval change; worsening PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral multifocal pulmonary opacities primarily in the bases, left greater
 than right with obscuring of the left hemidiaphragm border. Small left pleural
 effusion with left retrocardiac consolidation also seen.  Distention of the
 azygos vein raises the possibility of volume overload and pulmonary edema
 superimposed on known infection.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Dobhoff tube tip in the stomach. 
 ET tube 3.7 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral multifocal opacities with increasing opacities in the left lung
 base, small left pleural effusion, and left retrocardiac consolidation.
 Evolution of pulmonary findings with distention of the azygos vein raises the
 possibility of volume overload superimposed on known infection.
