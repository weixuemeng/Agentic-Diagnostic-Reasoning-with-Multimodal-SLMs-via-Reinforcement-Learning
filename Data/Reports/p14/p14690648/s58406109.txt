 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and apparent area of asymmetrical edema in the right
 perihilar region.  Differential diagnosis includes localized aspiration or
 early, developing pneumonia.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for incidental
 calcified granulomas in the left lung and a small right pleural effusion.
