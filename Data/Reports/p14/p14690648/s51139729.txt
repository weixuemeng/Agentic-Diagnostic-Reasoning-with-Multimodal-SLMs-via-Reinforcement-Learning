                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, intubated and sedated with endotracheal tube.
 
 CHEST:
 
 The endotracheal tube lies 3.1 cm from the carinal angle.  The position of the
 nasogastric tube cannot be determined.  It can be seen as far as the middle
 esophagus, but I expect it extends further.
 
 Atelectasis in both lungs is present.  The opacities present on the prior
 chest x-ray of ___ are significantly better.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in better position, clearing of right lung
 infiltrates.
