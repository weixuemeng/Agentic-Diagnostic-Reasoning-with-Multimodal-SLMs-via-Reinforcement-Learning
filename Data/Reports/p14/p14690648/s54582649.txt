 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion after transfusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  Mild perihilar fullness and upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
 vascularity suggests pulmonary venous hypertension without frank pulmonary
 edema.  Projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung is a nodular focus,
 probably a nipple shadow, not discernable on the prior study.  Relative
 increased density projecting over the left retrocardiac area is probably due
 to soft tissue attenuation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension without clear
 edema.  Nodular focus projecting over the right mid lung, probably a nipple
 shadow.  However, when clinically appropriate, confirmation using a repeat
 view with nipple markers is recommended.
