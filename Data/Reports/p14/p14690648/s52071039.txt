                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears moderately enlarged.  There is mild unfolding and
 calcification along the aorta.  Mild relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm compared to the right is noted.  There are also several small
 calcified nodules projecting over the left mid lung suggesting granulomas. 
 The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are difficult to assess, but there is
 apparently a moderate wedge compression deformity along the lower thoracic
 spine, as well as moderate degenerative changes throughout the visualized
 thoracic spine with narrowed interspaces.
  
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No evidence of acute disease.
