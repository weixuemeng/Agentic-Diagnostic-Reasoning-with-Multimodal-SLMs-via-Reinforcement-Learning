 The lungs remain hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation, effusion,
 pneumothorax, or edema.  The heart is likely mildly enlarged given the
 hyperinflated lungs, unchanged.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Hilar
 contours are normal.  Aortic knob calcifications and descending thoracic aorta
 calcifications are mild.  Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the upper thoracic
 spine and moderate levoconvex scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is more
 pronounced on today's exam and may be positional.  Vertebral body heights of
 the visualized thoracic spine on the lateral view appear unchanged without
 significant loss of vertebral body height.

 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs.
 3.  mild cardiomegaly.  No bronchovascular congestion, edema, or effusion.
