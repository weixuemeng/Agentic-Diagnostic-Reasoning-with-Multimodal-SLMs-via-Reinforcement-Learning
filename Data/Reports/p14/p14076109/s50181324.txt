                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 opacity projecting over the lower spine on the lateral view, not well
 substantiated on the frontal view, could be due to atelectasis, although an
 early/mild infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No prior for comparison.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  A well-defined ovoid 1
 cm calcific structure projecting over the right mid lung may relate to a
 calcified granuloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle basilar opacity could be due to right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
