                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 ___-year-old female patient status post right lower lobectomy in ___
 for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.  Now increased shortness of breath,
 check for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormalities identified.  The thoracic aorta is moderately
 widened and elongated and calcium deposits are seen in the wall, mostly at the
 level of the arch.  There are no local aortic wall contour abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute new infiltrates.
 The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation
 and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal
 view.  Moderate degree of demineralization is seen in the skeletal structures
 with an accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine as seen on the
 lateral view, but there is no evidence of any local vertebral body compression
 fracture.  The diminished pulmonary vasculature in the right hemithorax is
 consistent with history of a right lower lobe resection performed in ___.  No
 new parenchymal, pleural or vascular abnormalities have developed.
