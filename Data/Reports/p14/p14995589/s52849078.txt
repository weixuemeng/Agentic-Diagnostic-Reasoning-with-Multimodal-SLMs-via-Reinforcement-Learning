 The heart is borderline in size.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are probably unchanged within the limitations of the technique. Mild perihilar
 congestion is suspected and appears new.  In addition, there are small
 bilateral pleural effusions with opacities at the lung bases probably
 attributable to associated atelectasis.  Fissures are thickened.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions with suspected atelectasis.
