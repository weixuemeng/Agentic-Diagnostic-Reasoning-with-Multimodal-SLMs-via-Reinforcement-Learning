                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right leg cellulitis with brief hypotensive
 episode.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Exam is limited secondary to AP technique and patient
 body habitus as well as low inspiratory volume.  Increased bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, may be due to atelectasis.  There is no
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent but potentially accentuated for the
 reasons above.  Hiatal hernia is better seen on the lateral exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this limited
 exam due to low lung volumes technique and poor inspiratory effort.
