                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with trauma to the chest by a metal beam and
 right anterior chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes account for some bronchovascular crowding. No focal
 parenchymal opacities are identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No rib fractures
 are seen
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. No rib fracture is identified.
 However CXR is suboptimal for the detection of rib fractures and if there is
 further clinical concern dedicated rib views should the obtained.
