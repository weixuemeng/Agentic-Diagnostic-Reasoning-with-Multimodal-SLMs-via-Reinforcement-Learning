                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pancreatitis after
 IR-guided placement of the NG tube.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 Currently, the Dobbhoff tube tip is either in the stomach or in duodenum, most
 likely within the third portion of the duodenum.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.
