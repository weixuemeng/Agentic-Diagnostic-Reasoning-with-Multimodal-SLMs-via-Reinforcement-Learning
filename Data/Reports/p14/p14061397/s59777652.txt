                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and bacteremia, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube and
 dialysis catheter have been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  However, no convincing
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Vascular stent and prominence of
 the main pulmonary artery are again seen.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the
 bases, more prominent on the left.
