                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure in a patient with cardiac enlargement and tortuosity of the
 aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
 Tip of the dialysis catheter appears to extend to the lower right atrium or
 possibly the inferior vena cava.
