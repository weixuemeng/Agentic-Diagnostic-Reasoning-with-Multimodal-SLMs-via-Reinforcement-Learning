                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter again terminates in the right atrium,
 passing through a left brachiocephalic stent, as before.  The patient is also
 status post right shoulder replacement, as before.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged including tortuosity and calcification
 along the aorta and a left ventricular configuration to the cardiac contour. 
 The lung volumes are low, with streaky basilar opacities, which are more
 extensive in the left retrocardiac region than right and probably attributable
 to atelectasis.  Pleural effusions and pneumonia are not completely excluded,
 however.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities, greater on the
 left than right, probably attributable to atelectasis, but not entirely
 specific.  
 
 If pulmonary symptoms are present or other concern for pneumonia, than when
 clinically appropriate, short-term followup chest radiographs, preferably with
 standard PA and lateral technique if possible, could be considered.
