                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, missed hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is currently available on the PACS for
 comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large dual-lumen left-sided central venous catheter is seen
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction/right atrium.  There are relatively low
 lung volumes.  Left base opacity may relate to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally, there a couple subtle
 small patchy opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung and infectious process
 is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen; however, trace pleural
 effusions would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  There is mild prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  The aorta
 is calcified and tortuous.  Partially imaged right humeral prosthesis is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may be
 due to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally, two small subtle patchy areas of
 opacity in the right mid and lower lung could also be due to infection.  Prior
 studies are not currently available for comparison on PACS.
