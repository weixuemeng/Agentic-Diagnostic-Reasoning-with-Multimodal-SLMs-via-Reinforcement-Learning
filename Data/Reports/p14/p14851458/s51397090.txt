 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:00 PM
  IMPRESSION:  
  
  1.  Interval development of moderate sized left pleural effusion and
  mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema/vascular congestion suggesting acute heart
  failure.
  
  2.  Nodular character among diffuse opacities, probably due to heterogeneous
  involvement with edema; follow-up radiographs are recommended after diuresis
  to exclude underlying nodules, however.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac history and history of diabetes and hypertension, now
 with chest pressure and crackles on pulmonary exam, here to evaluate for
 pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior ___ study, there is
 interval development of a moderate to large sized left pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis or consolidation at the left lung base.  Patchy
 opacification at the right lung predominantly in the lower lung zones most
 likely represents mild to moderate pulmonary edema, although opacities in the
 right mid to lower lung are somewhat nodular.  No significant pleural effusion
 is seen in the right hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is moderately engorged compatible with underlying pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but
 likely remains enlarged as seen on the ___ study.  Increased prominence of
 the right paratracheal stripe is likely related to prominent mediastinal
 vasculature.  Aortic calcifications are re-demonstrated.  The trachea is
 midline.  Diffuse degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted with
 exuberant costochondral calcification.
