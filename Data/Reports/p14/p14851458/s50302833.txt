                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large left pleural effusion which appears slightly increased as
 compared to the prior study, with underlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is also moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema.  More confluent right base opacity may relate to pulmonary
 edema, however underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac
 silhouette is grossly stable although not accurately assessed due to the
 bibasilar opacities.  Aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left pleural effusion possibly minimally increased.  Moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema.  More confluent right basilar opacity may relate to pulmonary
 edema and small right pleural effusion however, underlying consolidation is
 not excluded.
