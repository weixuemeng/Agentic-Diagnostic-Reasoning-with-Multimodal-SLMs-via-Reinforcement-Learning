                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac surgery.  Evaluate for pneumothorax
 post-removal of chest tube.
 
 REPORT:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Abdominal epicardiac
 pacing leads are seen.  A prosthetic valve is also identified.  There is a
 right-sided central line in good position.  There is some expected blunting of
 the left costophrenic sulcus with a small effusion and perhaps minimal
 increased density in the right lower lung zone.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 No pneumothorax.
