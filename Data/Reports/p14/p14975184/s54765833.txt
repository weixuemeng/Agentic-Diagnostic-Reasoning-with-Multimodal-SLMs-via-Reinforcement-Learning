 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, fever.  Assess for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  Vertical linear
 retrocardiac opacity is stable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 A right hemodialysis catheter tip is in the right atrium.  1
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation is recommended to assess for superimposed pneumonia.
