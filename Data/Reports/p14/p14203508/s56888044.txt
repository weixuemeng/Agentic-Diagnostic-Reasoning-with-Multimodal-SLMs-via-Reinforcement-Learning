                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with airway swelling post op, intubated,
 concern for pneumonia  // assess for PNA, interval change, ETT     assess for
 PNA, interval change, ETT
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to previous chest film dated ___ at 05:13
 as well selected images from a chest CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 04:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. The pulmonary arteries
 remain prominent and may reflect underlying pulmonary artery hypertension.
 Several calcified masses in the left lower lobe better seen on the CT from
 ___ are not well visualized. There continues to be more focal consolidation
 at the left base likely with an associated effusion.  Overall, however, the
 left lower lobe process appears to be worsening suggesting that there likely
 is a superimposed infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Multiple calcified nodes are
 again seen in the neck. Hardware is seen overlying the mid to lower cervical
 spine.
