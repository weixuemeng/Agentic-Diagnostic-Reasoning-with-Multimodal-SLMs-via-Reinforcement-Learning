 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 08:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There are
 increasing bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis ,although
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Prominent pulmonary arteries
 raising the possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There
 are small layering effusions. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No overt pulmonary
 edema. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Multiple calcified nodes
 within the neck unchanged.
