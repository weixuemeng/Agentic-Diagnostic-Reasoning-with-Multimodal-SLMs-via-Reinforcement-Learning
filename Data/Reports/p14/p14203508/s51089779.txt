                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with resp insuffiency, s/p cervical anterior
 and posterior decompression/fusion  // tube placement, lung volumes     tube
 placement, lung volumes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, obliquity of the patient somewhat
 obscures detail. Nevertheless, there is engorgement of indistinct pulmonary
 vessels consistent with over-hydration or pulmonary vascular congestion. The
 left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, raising the possibility of volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. What presumably is an
 endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.
 Evidence of cervical fusion procedure and innumerable large calcified nodes in
 the neck.
