                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cervical decompression, continued
 intubation, s/p BAL ___  // Eval post-BAL changes and pleural effusion.    
 Eval post-BAL changes and pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  Increasing streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right base.
 Continued opacification in the retrocardiac region obscuring the hemidiaphragm
 is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
 Prominence of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally is again seen, consistent
 with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels
 suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
