                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, cough, not responsive to bronchodilators.  Eval for
 acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with the prior radiograph, lung volumes are low, accentuating
 the heart size and bronchovascular structures.  Bronchial cuffing bilaterally
 may suggest underlying bronchitis.  Lungs are otherwise clear, without pleural
 effusions, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes causing crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  
 Bronchial cuffing suggests bronchitis. No focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.
