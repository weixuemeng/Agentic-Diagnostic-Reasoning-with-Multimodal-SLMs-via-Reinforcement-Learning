                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ruptured aneurysm  // eval for pulm
 infiltrates, ?ARDS?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube remains in good position.  VP shunt is partially assessed.  There is
 worsening opacification in the left base with complete obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm probably reflecting some atelectasis.  In addition there is
 probably mild developing consolidation both right and left base.  Some lucency
 projected over the lower left chest probably reflects some interposed Bowel
 rather than a deep sulcus though attention to this area is suggested on
 follow-up.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Developing consolidation. Worsening atelectasis left base.
