  Low lying endotracheal tube. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for
  optimal positioning. Low lung volumes. Patchy left upper and left basilar
  opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis though aspiration or infection are
  not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new endotracheal tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 1.6 cm from the
 carina. Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette
 size which is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contour is also widened, but
 again this may be due to low lung volumes and supine positioning. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.
 Patchy opacities are noted within the left upper lobe and left lung base. No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. A VP shunt catheter is
 noted coursing along the right neck and chest. No acute osseous abnormalities
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for
 optimal positioning.
 2. Low lung volumes. Patchy left upper and left basilar opacities may reflect
 areas of atelectasis though aspiration or infection are not excluded.
