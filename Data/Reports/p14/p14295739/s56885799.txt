                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with advanced dementia, right shoulder
 septic arthritis and colitis, appearing more ill this morning with poor
 inspiratory efforts.  Please evaluate for consolidation or effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examinations in sitting semi-upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with a
 similar preceding study of ___.  The heart size has increased and
 bilateral basal densities are now obscuring diaphragmatic contour and blunting
 the lateral pleural sinuses.  The lateral view confirms the bilateral pleural
 effusions that have increased and blunting the posterior pleural sinuses more
 than before.  Within the heart shadow, there are rather typical calcifications
 within the aortic valve area strongly suggesting the presence of aortic valve
 stenosis.  Additional linear calcifications in the ascending aorta are seen as
 before.  No new abnormalities in the pulmonary parenchymal area and skeletal
 structures are unchanged.  Several preceding chest examinations are reviewed
 and include studies of ___, ___, and ___.  A previously
 suspected calcification on the right lung base was identified as being located
 in the right breast.  Thus, there is no evidence of new acute or old chronic
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities.
 
 On the previous examinations, the rather typical aortic valve calcifications
 were also noted but reported apparently as this finding was of no greater
 importance in this elderly demented patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of bilateral pleural effusion, increasing heart size
 indicative of chronic CHF.  No evidence of pneumonia.
