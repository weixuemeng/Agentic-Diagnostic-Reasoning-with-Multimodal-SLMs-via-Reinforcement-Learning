                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of esophageal
 stricture with elevated white blood cell count and concern for aspiration.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable including tortuous aorta with known
 aortic arch aneurysmatic dilatation.  The left upper lobe nodule is
 re-demonstrated.  Lungs are well expanded.  There are opacities in both lower
 lobes, faint and might reflect areas of aspiration.  Pneumonia would be
 another possibility.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
