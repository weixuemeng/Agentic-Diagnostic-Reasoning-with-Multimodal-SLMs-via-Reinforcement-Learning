                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous with enlargement of the aortic
 knob and displaced intimal calcifications compatible with known aortic arch
 aneurysm, unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted.  Increased streaky
 opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be excluded.  15 mm lingular nodule is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A mid thoracic vertebral body compression deformity is re-
 demonstrated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased streaky opacity within the right lung base which could reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Emphysema.
 
 3.  Unchanged 15 mm nodule within the lingula.  As noted on the prior PET CT
 from ___, continued imaging followup of this lesion is
 recommended, and a chest CT should be obtained at this time.  
 
 4.  Aortic arch aneurysm, unchanged.
