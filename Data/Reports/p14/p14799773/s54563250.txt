                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible new opacities on portable chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a much better degree of inspiration.  The apparent increased
 opacification at the bases, more prominent on the right, most likely
 represented crowding of interstitial markings.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia at this time.  
 
 The left mid lung opacification appears stable.
