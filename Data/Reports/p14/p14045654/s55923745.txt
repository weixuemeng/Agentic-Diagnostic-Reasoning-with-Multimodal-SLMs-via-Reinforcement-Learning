                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hyperglycemia and seizures.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There low lung volumes..  The aorta is tortuous and heart size is
 normal.  Bronchovascular crowding is likely secondary to low lung volumes.
 Streaky bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 and bibasilar streaky opacities, possibly atelectasis, but aspiration is not
 excluded.
