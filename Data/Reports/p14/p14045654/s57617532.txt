                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with minor injury to right knee.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are low, exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular markings.  Indistinct
 appearance of the pulmonary vascular markings is compatible with mild edema. 
 Bibasilar linear opacities are compatible with atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  A TIPS is seen in the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, exaggerated by low lung volumes.
