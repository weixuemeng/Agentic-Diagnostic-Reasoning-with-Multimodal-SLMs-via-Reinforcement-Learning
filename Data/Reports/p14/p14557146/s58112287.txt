                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent coughing in chronic smoker.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with emphysema, though
 there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  No vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.  Enlargement and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
