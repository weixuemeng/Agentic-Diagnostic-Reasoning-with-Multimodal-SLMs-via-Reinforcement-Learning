                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little change in comparison to prior study.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated consistent with emphysema.  The aorta appears tortuous.

 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Emphysema is again noted.
