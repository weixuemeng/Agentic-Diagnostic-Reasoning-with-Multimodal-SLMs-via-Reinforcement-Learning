                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation on amiodarone.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs without
 interstitial abnormality to suggest amiodarone toxicity.  The remainder of the
 exam is unchanged, with a similar appearance of the tortuous aorta and a heart
 which is normal in size. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperexpanded lungs suggestive of COPD. No interstitial abnormality to suggest
 amiodarone toxicity.
