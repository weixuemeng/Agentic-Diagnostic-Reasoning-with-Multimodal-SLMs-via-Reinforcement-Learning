                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of severe COPD and increased dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are hyperinflated bilaterally with paucity of pulmonary
 markings in the upper fields consistent with diagnosis of COPD.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of CHF.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.  An area of subtly increased opacity in the right lower lung
 field which, in view of the symptoms, may be suggestive of pneumonia. 
 Incidentally seen is a calcified left axillary joint body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity for which, in view of symptoms,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
