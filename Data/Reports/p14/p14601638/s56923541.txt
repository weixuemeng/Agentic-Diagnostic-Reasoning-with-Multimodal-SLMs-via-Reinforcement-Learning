                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Short of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show severe COPD with paucity of
 lung markings in the upper lung zones.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms.  These findings are unchanged from the prior
 exam.  Linear opacities at the left base appears stable from prior exam and
 are likely due to atelectasis or scarring.  In the proper clinical setting, an
 early pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable severe COPD.
 2.  Probable left basilar atelectasis and/or scarring.  In the proper clinical
 setting, an early pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.
