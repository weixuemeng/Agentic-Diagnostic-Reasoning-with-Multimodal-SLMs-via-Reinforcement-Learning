                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated following transfer for suspected
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiographs ___ at 04:12.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube terminates 5 cm above the carina in appropriate location.  A
 right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable. 
 Focal opacity in the left mid lung is concerning for pneumonia.  Diffuse mild
 interstitial prominence of the central predominance is suggestive of pulmonary
 vascular congestion possible early pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe opacities
 could represent atelectasis and or pneumonia.  Partially visualized is lower
 thoracic and lumbar spine spinal fusion hardware.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal opacity in the left mid lung concerning for pneumonia.
 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion .
 3. Bibasilar opacities improved on the left suggests improved atelectasis,
 residual opacities in the right lung could represent atelectasis or pneumonia
 4. ET tube terminating 5.0 cm above the carina, in grossly appropriate
 location.  Right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.
