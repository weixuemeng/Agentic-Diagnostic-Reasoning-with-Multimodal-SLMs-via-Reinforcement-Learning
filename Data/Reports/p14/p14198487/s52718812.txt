                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p multiple lumbar spine fusions with fever.  //
 Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable compared to ___ radiograph.  Lungs are remarkable
 for a new patchy opacity partially obscuring P medial left hemidiaphragm.  In
 the recent postoperative setting, this could reflect localized atelectasis,
 aspiration, and less likely an early focus of pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear except minimal linear bibasilar atelectasis peripherally.
