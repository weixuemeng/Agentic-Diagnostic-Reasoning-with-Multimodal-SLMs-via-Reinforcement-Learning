                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension, L picc  line  // Eval for acute
 process, PICC line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, overall similar compared to ___.  Overt pulmonary edema.  Left retrocardiac opacity persists,
 although perhaps slightly better aerated compared to the prior study.  This
 most likely represents dependent atelectasis, although superimposed infection
 would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 no sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Final hardware is partially imaged in the upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Overall stable pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely representing atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
