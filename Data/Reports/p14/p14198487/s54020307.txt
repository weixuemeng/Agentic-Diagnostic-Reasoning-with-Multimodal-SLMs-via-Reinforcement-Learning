                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA, hypoxemic resp failure, septic shock 
 // NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___ at 05:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained approximately 7 hours prior,
 there has been interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the
 distal stomach.  Mid left lung opacity identified on prior radiograph is not
 well appreciated on the current study, possibly due to differences in patient
 positioning.  There is increased retrocardiac opacification.  Increased right
 lower lung opacities may be exaggerated by superimposed projection projection
 of the inferior right scapula.  These opacities may reflect underlying
 pneumonia or solid.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is essentially unchanged. 
 An ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Right-sided PICC
 terminates near the confluence of the right subclavian vein and right
 brachiocephalic vein.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An enteric tube terminates in the distal stomach.
 A right-sided PICC terminates near the confluence of the right subclavian vein
 and right brachiocephalic vein.
 Right lower lung and retrocardiac opacities are concerning for pneumonia or
 atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 3:25 PM, approximately 20
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
