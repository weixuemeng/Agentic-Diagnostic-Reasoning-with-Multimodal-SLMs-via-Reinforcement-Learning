                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo, intubated and sedated. septic  // assess NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___ at 13:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1.5 hours prior, no significant
 changes are appreciated.  An NG tube passes into the stomach and outside the
 field of view.  Previously identified mid left lung opacity is better
 appreciated.  Retrocardiac and right lower lung opacities are essentially
 unchanged.  Support lines and tubes are otherwise unchanged in position, with
 a right-sided PICC that terminates more proximally than is standard practice
 near the confluence of the right subclavian and right brachiocephalic veins.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube terminates in the distal stomach.
 Mid left lung, retrocardiac, and right lower lung opacities are concerning for
 pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
