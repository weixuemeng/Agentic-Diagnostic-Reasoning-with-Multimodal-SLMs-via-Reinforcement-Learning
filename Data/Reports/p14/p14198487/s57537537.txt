                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance, unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are re- demonstrated
 in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis though aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  Sub acute
 left-sided rib fractures are again.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, as seen previously, findings which may
 reflect atelectasis though aspiration cannot be excluded.
