                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV/AIDS  CD4<200, admitted with neutropenic
 fever and septic shock attributed to aspiration pneumonia. Now with severe
 headache and decreasing O2 saturation.  // re-assess infiltrate    re-assess
 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 both before and after chest CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The chest CTA ___ was performed at 16:26 ; it showed no pneumonia but
 evidence of chronic aspiration.  A chest radiograph earlier in the day, 13:55
 showed a clear right lower lobe, but a subsequent chest radiograph at 18:41
 showed greater opacity in the right infrahilar lung, and that area is slightly
 more abnormal today.
 
 Given the technical limitations of bedside radiographs, I am hesitant to say
 the the changes are real and diagnostic of pneumonia, but they certainly could
 be.  I would much prefer to be looking at a series of conventional chest
 radiographs in order to make that determination.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs, if feasible.
