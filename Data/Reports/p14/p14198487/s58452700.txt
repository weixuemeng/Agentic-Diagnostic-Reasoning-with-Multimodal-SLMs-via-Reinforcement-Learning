                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes remain low. The heart
 size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, slightly improved
 compared to the previous examination, and may reflect atelectasis however
 recurrent aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 which may be due to pleural thickening or a trace right pleural effusion.  A
 balloon projects over the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, possibly from a
 percutaneous gastrostomy catheter.  Spinal fusion hardware in the lumbar spine
 is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are improved compared to the previous
 chest radiograph, and may reflect atelectasis but recurrent aspiration or
 infection is not excluded.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be
 due to pleural thickening or a trace right pleural effusion.
