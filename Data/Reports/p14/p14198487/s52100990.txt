                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, PE, respiratory distress  // Evaluate
 for edema, interval worsening of aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, worsening opacity in the left
 retrocardiac region is probably a combination of elevated left hemidiaphragm
 bend adjacent worsening atelectasis, although coexisting aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Tubular opacity in right lower lobe appears to correspond to an area of mucous
 plugging on CT abdomen of the same date.  No other relevant changes.
