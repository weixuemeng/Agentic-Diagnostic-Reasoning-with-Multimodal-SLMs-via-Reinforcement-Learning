                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion and collapse, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 substantial right pleural effusion with concomitant lower lobe collapse. 
 Probably some much less prominent atelectatic changes with a possible pleural
 effusion on the left.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists,
 enhanced by the low lung volumes.  Dual-channel pacer device has leads
 extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.  No definite
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
