                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mid right thoracic pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart remains moderately enlarged
 but unchanged.  Large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  Fat containing posterior diaphragmatic hernia on
 the right is unchanged.  Patchy ill-defined opacity in the right lung base is
 new with with similar-appearing opacification in the left lung base.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  A small right pleural effusion
 is likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures is seen.  Loss of height of a low thoracic vertebral body
 appears relatively unchanged.  Worsening compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body is noted compared to the previous radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased bibasilar airspace opacities which are nonspecific but could
 reflect infection.
 
 2. Large hiatal hernia and fat containing right posterior diaphragmatic
 hernia.
 
 3. Probable small right pleural effusion.
 
 4. Slight interval increase in extent of a compression deformity of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body.
