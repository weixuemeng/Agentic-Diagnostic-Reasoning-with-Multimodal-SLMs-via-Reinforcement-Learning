                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with unresponsive period, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Lung volumes are
 markedly low which limits the evaluation.  Allowing for this, no definite sign
 of pneumonia, CHF, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size appears
 grossly within normal limits.  Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for
 slight hilar prominence.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings on this limited exam.
