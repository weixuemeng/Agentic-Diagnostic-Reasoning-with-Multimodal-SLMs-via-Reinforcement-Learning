                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is
 elevation of right hemidiaphragm which is of unknown chronicity.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Degenerative changes are seen within
 the thoracic spine.  Several surgical clips project over the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, the latter of
 which is of unknown chronicity.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
