                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Previously demonstrated left
 PICC is no longer visualized.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged
 with tortuosity of thoracic aorta again noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base appears slightly improved,
 likely reflective of residual aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion also
 appears resolved compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 Degenerative changes of the right AC joint are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the left PICC.  Improvement in the right basilar patchy
 opacity likely reflective of chronic aspiration with resolution of previously
 noted small right pleural effusion.
