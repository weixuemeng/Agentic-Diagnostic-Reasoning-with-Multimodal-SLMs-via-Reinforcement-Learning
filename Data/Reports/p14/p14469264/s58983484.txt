                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains mildly dilated and
 tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  New
 focal consolidation within the right lower lobe is compatible with pneumonia. 
 Minimal retrocardiac patchy opacity is also seen.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 compatible with underlying COPD.  There is no pleural effusion is definitively
 seen.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 Osteophytic spurring is seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity could reflect an
 additional site of pneumonia or atelectasis.  Follow up radiographs after
 treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
