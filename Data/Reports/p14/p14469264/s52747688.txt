                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD now with tachypnea RR > ___, low grade
 fevers CXR ?R basilar pneumonia  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ portable chest radiograph, the patient is again
 rotated.  Hyperinflation of both ungs and flattening of the hemidiaphragms are
 attributable to COPD.  Heterogeneous coalescing opacification at the lung
 bases, right greater than left, has progressed slightly, most consistent with
 worsening aspiration pneumonia.   The right costophrenic angle is blunted by a
 small right pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Worsening bibasilar, aspiration pneumonia.
 2. COPD
