                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female found down.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph obscured by trauma board
 demonstrates low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged though this
 may reflect expiratory phase scanning.  Diffuse bilateral lung opacifications
 likely reflect technique and low lung volumes.  No definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is evident on this limited study.
 
 IMPRESSION: Expiratory phase scan with limited evaluation of cardiac
 silhouette and lungs.  If concerned for cardiopulmonary process, repeat chest
 x-ray.
