                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are clear with
 no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The lungs do,
 however, appear hyperinflated and may represent chronic obstructive lung
 disease.  Otherwise, two-lead pacemaker appears in place.  The aorta appears
 mildly tortuous.  Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
