                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for
 apical lordotic projection and relatively low lung volumes.  Bilateral lower
 lobe opacities are present, with some interval improvement on the right, but
 slight worsening in the left retrocardiac region.  On the lateral view, these
 project posteriorly over the spine and are associated with air bronchograms. 
 There are no pleural effusions.  Skeletal structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar confluent opacities, slightly improved on the right and
 slightly worse on the left.  Considering recent history of altered mental
 status, aspiration pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
