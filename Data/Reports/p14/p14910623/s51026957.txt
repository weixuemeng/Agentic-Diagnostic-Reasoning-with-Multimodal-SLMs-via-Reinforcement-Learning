 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post pneumonia, treated with
 levofloxacin.  Questionable left upper lobe pneumonia on latest chest
 examination, now with resumption of cough and sputum, possible other pneumonic

 ___.  Heart size, mediastinal structures, and thoracic aorta
 are unchanged in appearance.  Pulmonary vasculature not congested.  The
 previously identified multiple scattered patchy infiltrates in the left upper

 parenchymal infiltrates.  Pleural spaces remain free.  Comparison of lateral
 views also confirms disappearance of the previously described patchy
 infiltrates.
