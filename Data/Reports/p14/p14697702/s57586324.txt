                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain, hypoxia, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Torso CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged and
 attributable to a large hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver as
 seen on recent CT.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right,
 are compatible with areas of atelectasis, and appear similar compared to the
 prior CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm due to
 known right hepatic lobe hypodense lesion as seen on recent CT.
