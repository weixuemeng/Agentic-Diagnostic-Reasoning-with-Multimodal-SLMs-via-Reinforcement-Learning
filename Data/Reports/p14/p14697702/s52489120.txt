                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative tachycardia with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low lung
 volumes with increasing areas of opacification at the right base, most likely
 reflecting post-operative atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Of incidental note is no change in the appearance of the old healed fracture
 of the left clavicle.
