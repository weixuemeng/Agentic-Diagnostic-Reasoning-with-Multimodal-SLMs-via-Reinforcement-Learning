                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Brief episode of chest pain while exercising.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, but the presence of low
 lung volumes causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Several clips are
 demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
