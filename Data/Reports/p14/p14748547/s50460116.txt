                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest wall hematoma, pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal as the patient's arm obscures a large portion of the field
 of view.  Given this, the patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob
 is calcified.  Left-sided pacer device is stable in position as are abandoned
 leads.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Grossly clear lungs.
