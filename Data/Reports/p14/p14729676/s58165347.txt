 above the carina.  A transesophageal tube is seen, with the side port
 terminating past the GE junction and the tip not visible past the film.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal.  There are patchy, bibasilar opacities, worse on
 the right than on the left, which, in the appropriate clinical context, may
 represent infection.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
