                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and viral syndrome.  Evaluate for
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is increase in the interstitial
 markings, more pronounced in the right lung, with more focal patchy opacities
 throughout the right lower lung region.  No focal opacities are noted in the
 left.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings with more focal patchy opacities
 in the right lower lung region raise concern for pneumonia, possibly atypical.
 Recommend follow-up to resolution.
