                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post bypass surgery and
 adjustment of Swan position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding study
 performed one hour earlier during the same day.  During the interval, the
 position of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been adjusted and is now seen to point
 with its tip towards the right of the midline being located in the central
 portion of the pulmonary artery.  The previously described bent of the tip has
 been eliminated.  No other interval changes are seen.
