                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with coughcig smoker for a long time  // r/o
 acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. There is
 no obvious evidence for the presence of nodules or masses.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of pathological changes in lung
 volume. A small platelike atelectasis or scar at the bases of the right upper
 lobe is completely unchanged. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 Unchanged normal structure of the hilus.
 Given the post smoking history of the patient, CT should be considered to rule
 out smoking related lung disease, given the superior sensitivity of this
 technique.
