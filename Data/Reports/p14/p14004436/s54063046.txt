                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, here to evaluate for
 pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant crowding of
 bronchovascular structures. Within this limitation, there is no significant
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is resultant
 prominence of the cardiac mediastinal silhouette due to low lung volumes which
 is likely within limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary process.
