                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest tightness yesterday, now with
 left-sided numbness.  Per medical history, the patient has history of
 sarcoidosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exams
 dating back to ___ with most recent from ___.
 
 When compared to most recent exam, there has been apparent interval increase
 in size and conspicuity of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, more numerous
 at the right mid lung and right lung base compared to prior.  Increased
 density projecting over the right hilum, compatible with adenopathy as on
 prior.  There is no large confluent consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Apparent interval increase in number and conspicuity of multiple bilateral
 pulmonary nodules, more so on the right than on the left when compared to most
 recent exam from ___.  While this could be compatible with
 patient's known history of sarcoidosis, nonurgent CT scan of the chest should
 be considered for more complete evaluation.
