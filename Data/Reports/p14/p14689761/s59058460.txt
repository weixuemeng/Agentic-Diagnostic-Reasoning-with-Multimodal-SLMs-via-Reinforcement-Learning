                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest burning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been a decrease in right hilar and subcarinal fullness
 since that examination.  However, a number of nodular foci appear increased or
 new in each lung; these are otherwise hard to assess in detail.  The minor
 fissure shows new thickening.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent increase in size and number of pulmonary nodules.  When
 clinically appropriate, correlation with chest CT is recommended.  Persistent
 but decreased hilar and subcarinal soft tissue fullness reflecting a probable
 reduction in lymphadenopathy.
