                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough for 2 weeks. hx of sarcoidosis  // eval
 for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Right perihilar fullness
 has increased since the prior study from ___ although is more similar
 in appearance compared to ___, which may represent increase and
 adenopathy in this patient with history of sarcoidosis. Right lung nodular
 densities are grossly stable. However, there appears to be increase in
 conspicuity and possibly number of left-sided pulmonary nodular opacities ; as
 also suggested on the prior study, correlation with chest CT would be
 recommended. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right hilar fullness may be due to increased adenopathy in this
 patient with sarcoidosis, underlying consolidation not excluded. Increased
 conspicuity and possibly number of pulmonary nodular opacities, particularly
 on the left, could relate to sarcoidosis, however, as also suggested on the
 prior study, correlate with chest CT.
