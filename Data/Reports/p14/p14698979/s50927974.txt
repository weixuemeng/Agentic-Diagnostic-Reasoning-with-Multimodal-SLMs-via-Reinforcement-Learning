                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, with moderate hyponatremia.  Assess for pulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 noted with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There are slightly
 asymmetric lung volumes, left greater than right, but there is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  There is linear opacity in the right apex which is
 poorly characterized due to overlying external structures and portable
 technique.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  
 
 Of note, there is a necklace overlying the upper mediastinum, but without
 significant obscuration of the underlying structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity in the right upper lung is likely due to fcal
 parenchymal scarring or atelectasis.  Recommend PA and lateral chest
 radiograph to better characterize this finding and to exclude scar carcinoma.
