                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Linearly oriented opacity within the right upper lobe is probably
 an area of localized scar or atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 except for pleural and parenchymal scarring in the periphery of the left apex.
 The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter
 continues to terminate in the lower superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linearly oriented right upper lobe opacity favors a focal area of
 scarring or atelectasis.
