  Increased density in the lateral view projecting over the spine which could
  represent interval development of infection, potentially within the right
  lower lobe although not definitively localized on the frontal view. 
  Alternatively, increased density within the bones is possible. Followup will
  be necessary.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with productive cough and weakness  // Please assess for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral view there is increased density projecting over the lower
 thoracic spine.  This may localize the right on the frontal although is not
 dramatically different from prior.  Known bilateral pulmonary nodules are
 better assessed on chest CT.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Left-sided volume loss is compatible with prior left-sided lobectomy.  Chronic
 deformity of the left posterior rib is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density in the lateral view projecting over the spine which could
 represent interval development of infection, potentially within the right
 lower lobe although not definitively localized on the frontal view. 
 Alternatively, increased density within the bones is possible.  Followup will
 be necessary.
