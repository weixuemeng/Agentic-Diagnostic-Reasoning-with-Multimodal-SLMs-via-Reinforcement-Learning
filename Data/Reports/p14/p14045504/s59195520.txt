                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left upper lobectomy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 Two left chest tubes are in place.  Minimal pneumothorax is noted along the
 left chest wall.  Subcutaneous air appears to be unchanged or even minimally
 increased since the prior study.  Right lung remains unremarkable.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are grossly stable.  Gastric bubble is noted.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects area of atelectasis.
