                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left apicolateral hydropneumothorax is similar in appearance to the
 previous study.  Although it appears small in size on the frontal view, it is
 more substantial on the lateral view in the retrosternal region and is best
 characterized as moderate in size.  Postoperative alterations of the
 cardiomediastinal contours on the left are unchanged as well as left-sided
 volume loss consistent with prior left upper lobe resection.  Improving
 atelectasis at the lung bases, and a decrease in small left pleural effusion,
 which is nearly resolved.  Probable persistent small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left hydropneumothorax.
