 COMPARISON:  CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A left hilar
 opacity which is new from ___ with hazy opacification and volume loss of
 the left upper lobe is concerning for a left hilar mass with distal

 left juxtaphrenic peak is suspicious for extensive left upper lobe volume
 loss.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Heart size is normal.  The right hilar contours are normal.  No upper
 abdominal or acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left hilar opacity with findings suggesting extensive left upper
 lobe atelectasis associated with an obstructing mass.  CT is recommended for
 further evaluation, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible, to
 assess further when clinically appropriate.
