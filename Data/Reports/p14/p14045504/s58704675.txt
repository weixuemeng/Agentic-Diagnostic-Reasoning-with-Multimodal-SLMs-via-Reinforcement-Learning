                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobectomy.  Chest tube removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to 1:55 a.m.:
 
 The frontal view shows small left pneumothorax along the lateral costal
 pleural surface is unchanged since earlier in the day, but the lateral view
 shows a larger persistent anterior pleural space vacated by the resected left
 upper lobe.  It also shows small bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacification
 of the base of the right lung is less pronounced now than it was on the
 earlier study, probably due to absorption of asymmetric pulmonary edema.  I
 would not expect pneumonia to improve so rapidly.  Mild cardiomegaly
 unchanged.  Moderate left basal atelectasis stable.  No right pneumothorax. 
 ___ was paged.
