 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing left apical
 pneumothorax is completely resolved.  There is a normal post-surgical
 appearance of the left lung, including elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 with clips projecting over the left lung base.  A pre-existing post-surgical
 discontinuation of the sixth left rib is slightly more evident than on the
 previous image.  Unremarkable right lung.
