                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with RUQ rib pain +___'s  // eval for pnaeval for acute
 chlocysitis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 Vague opacity at the left lung base laterally on the frontal view is
 compatible with previously seen metastatic lesion.  Vague right upper lung
 opacities with some adjacent linear opacities air seen in the region of
 previously characterized metastatic foci as well.  More dense right perihilar
 opacity better characterized by prior CT as metastatic disease.  There is an
 additional lesion abutting the descending thoracic aorta in the retrocardiac
 region, also present on prior CT scan.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.  Surgical clips project over the left chest wall.  Mild
 height loss of lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged from prior CT. 
 There is no free intraperitoneal air visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Additional regions of consolidation
 in the lungs seen in the region of prior metastatic disease.  Difficult to
 assess for interval change in these lesions given differences in technique.
