                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left upper lobectomy.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 9:53 a.m., the small left-sided pneumothorax appears
 slightly larger.  In addition, the anterior pleural space vacated by the
 resected left upper lobe is persistent and slightly more prominent on today's
 exam. Left-sided volume loss itself is unchanged with slight left-ward shift
 of the mediastinum and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Again noted is
 osteotomy or fracture of the left posterolateral sixth rib, which is probably
 unchanged.  Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is noted anterior to the
 anterior edge of the hemidiaphragm, newly visible on today's of the exam.
 
 Left base atelectasis is slightly improved. The right lung is grossly clear
 except for minimal atelectasis and/or scarring at the right lung base. Small
 bilateral effusions, probably  unchanged.  Cardiomegaly, unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small left apical pneumothorax, slightly larger than one day earlier.
 Please see comment.   Left hemithorax volume loss, unchanged.
 
 2) Osteotomy vs fracture left 6th rib posteriorly.
 
 3) Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema anterior to the anterior edge of the
 hemidiaphragm, newly visible.
