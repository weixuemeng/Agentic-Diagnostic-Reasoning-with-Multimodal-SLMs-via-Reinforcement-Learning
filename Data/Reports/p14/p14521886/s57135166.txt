                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPESSION:
 
 A pacemaker/ICD is seen on the left side with the leads terminating over the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricles, respectively. 
 There has been a median sternotomy for CABG.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 with a left ventricular prominence suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy.
 No pulmonary edema is seen.  No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.  No focal
 airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is a 1.8 cm
 nodular opacity at the right apex which most likely is related to the
 costochondral junction rather than representing a lung mass.  Correlation with
 prior chest films would be advised to assess this further.  If these prior
 chest films are not available, then further imaging evaluation with CT should
 be considered.   Results of this examination were placed in the critical
 results dashboard to ensure appropriate communication of this finding on
 ___ at 12:24 p.m.
