                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fatigue and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 within normal limits.  Faint nodular opacity within the right lung base
 measuring up to 12 mm is unchanged compared to the prior study.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Scarring within the lung apices is present.  Mild reduction of
 height of a low thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Nodular opacity projecting
 over the right lung base is unchanged compared to the prior study, and is
 unlikely to reflect a nipple shadow.  CT is recommended for further evaluation
 on a non-emergent basis.
