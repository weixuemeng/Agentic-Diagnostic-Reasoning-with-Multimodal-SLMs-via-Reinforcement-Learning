                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA and hypoxia  // volume overload vs.
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with chest radiograph on ___, overall lung volumes are
 decreased.  A right lower and middle lung opacity slightly worse compared with
 prior.  There is a new opacity at the left lung base, likely atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly decreased compared with prior, but
 remains mild.  A right pleural effusion is similar to prior.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval worsening of a right mid and lower lung consolidation is
 concerning for evolving pneumonia and less likely represents asymmetric
 pulmonary edema given the interval slight improvement in pulmonary vascular
 congestion compared with prior.  Small right pleural effusion is similar to
 prior.
 2. New opacity at the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.
