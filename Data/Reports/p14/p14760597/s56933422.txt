                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with patchy opacity
 in the right lung base, potentially atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base may
 reflect atelectasis, however an infectious process is not excluded.
