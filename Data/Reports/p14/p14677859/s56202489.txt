                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and hypoxemia.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded. There are diffuse interstitial
 abnormalities and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly likely reflecting some
 component of interstitial pulmonary edema. Opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.    The aortic arch
 is calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Borderline interstitial pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion. 
 3.  Hyperexpanded lungs likely reflecting COPD.
