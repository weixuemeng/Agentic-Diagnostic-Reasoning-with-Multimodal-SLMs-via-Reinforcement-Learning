                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM ___ AT 824
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with extreme lethargy, assess for interval
 change, oxygenation in the 70s overnight, unclear cause for spontaneous
 resolution.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 824 is just submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continue to be bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated
 bibasilar airspace disease which could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 Overall, however, the underlying vascular pattern has improved which suggests
 that the previously seen findings did have a component of congestive failure. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.  A calcified pleural plaque is seen at the
 right lateral apex, raises possibility of prior asbestos exposure.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 positioning and technique between studies.  There continues to be a
 thoracolumbar scoliosis.
