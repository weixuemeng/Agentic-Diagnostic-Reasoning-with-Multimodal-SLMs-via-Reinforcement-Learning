                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fall.  Evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Study is limited by patient's positioning
 and scoliosis.  Within this limitation, opacity at the left lung base may
 represent pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis; however,
 infectious process cannot be completely excluded. Bilateral low lung volumes
 are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings.  Cardiac silhouette
 appears accentuated by low lung volumes.  Aorta appears mildly tortuous.  No
 acute rib fractures are identified.  If there is continued clinical concern
 for rib fractures, then a dedicated rib series can be obtained.  There is
 severe dextroscoliosis.
