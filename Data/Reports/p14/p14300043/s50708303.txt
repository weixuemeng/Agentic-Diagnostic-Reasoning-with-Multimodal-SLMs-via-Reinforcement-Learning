                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 21:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with acute hypoxia, assess for worsening
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.  Portable semi-erect chest film
 ___ at 21:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient positioning and rotation between studies.  There is
 interval increase in hazy opacity throughout both lungs as well as increasing
 patchy opacities in both mid-to-lower lungs.  These findings most likely
 reflect worsening pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Pulmonary edema would be much
 less likely.  No pneumothorax.  Prominent thoracolumbar scoliosis, unchanged. 
 Slight irregularity to the right seventh anterolateral rib, which may
 represent a non-displaced fracture.
