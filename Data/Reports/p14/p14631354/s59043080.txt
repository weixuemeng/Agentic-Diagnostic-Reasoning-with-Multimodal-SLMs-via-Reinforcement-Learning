                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Palpable bony mass at the sternal area adjacent to
 head of the clavicle on the left.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Within the limitations of the study technique, there is no abnormality to
 explain patient's symptoms demonstrated.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are normal in
 diameter.  Bone structures are unremarkable.
 
 Further assessment with chest CT is required to exclude the possibility of
 radiographically occult lesion.
