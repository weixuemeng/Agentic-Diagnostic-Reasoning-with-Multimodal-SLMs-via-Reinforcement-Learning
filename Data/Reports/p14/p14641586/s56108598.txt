                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with palpitations  // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  PRIOR EXAM DATED ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Retrocardiac opacity is again
 noted which is compatible with hiatal hernia.  There is bibasilar atelectasis
 also noted.  Subtle ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung could also
 represent aspiration versus pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Upper
 lungs appear well aerated.  The heart size is difficult to assess. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hiatal hernia, bibasilar atelectasis, difficult to exclude an early pneumonia
 in the left lower lung in the correct clinical setting.
