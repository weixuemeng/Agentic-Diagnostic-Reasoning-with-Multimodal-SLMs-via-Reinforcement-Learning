                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, hemoptysis + h/o pna  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the sternal wires are in unchanged
 position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with elongation of the descending
 aorta. The left pleural effusion has resolved.  In the perihilar lung regions
 on the right, there is a minimal increase in radiodensity on the frontal view
 that is not reflected on the lateral view. Nevertheless, given the clinical
 presentation of the patient, developing pneumonia cannot be excluded and
 should be confirmed clinically. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is normal.
