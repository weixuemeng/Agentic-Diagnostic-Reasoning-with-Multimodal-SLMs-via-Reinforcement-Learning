                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Permanent pacemaker is present with leads overlying the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The right ventricular lead has an unusual
 cephalad course of the distal tip.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
 normal in size, and pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Moderate elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged since the prior study, and is associated
 with adjacent basilar atelectasis.  Focal atelectasis is also present at the
 left lung base.  Small right pleural effusion is present, and has also been
 documented on recent abdominal CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion.  Linear opacities at both lung
 bases favor atelectasis over infectious pneumonia, but followup radiographs
 may be helpful to exclude early infectious consolidation given clinical
 suspicion for this entity.
