                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p left fem pop exploration  // post op
 baserline- tubes, lines
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC.  The patient is intubated,
 the endotracheal tube is positioned 4 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip terminates below the diaphragm.
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low resulting crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Mild prominence of the interstitial markings and bilateral hila
 is likely related to this.  No frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is unchanged compared to the prior study.  No consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
