                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with graft infection  // r/o inf, eff
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminates approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube is incompletely visualized however the tip lies
 below the diaphragm.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 The trachea is central, lung volumes remain slightly low.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study.  There has
 been progression of the atelectasis at the left lung base with a more linear
 appearance on the current study.  Mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular
 likely reflects a degree of fluid overload.  No pleural effusion seen.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of the left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no significant
 interval change.
