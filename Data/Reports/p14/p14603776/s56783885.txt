 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with polytrauma.  History of transection of

 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates left upper
 mediastinal widening which is not significantly changed since the prior study.
 Likewise, the previously seen left pleural fluid and left basilar atelectasis
 are also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Of note,
 the right lower lung demonstrates possible air bronchograms.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Possible right lower lung air bronchograms suggesting pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, not significantly changed
 since the prior exam.
