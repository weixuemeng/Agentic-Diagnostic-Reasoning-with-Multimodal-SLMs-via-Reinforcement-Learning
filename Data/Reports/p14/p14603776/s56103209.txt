                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:41 P.M. ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with polytrauma after left chest tube
 discontinued.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 A small amount of air defines the track of the left apical pleural tube since
 removed.  I would recommend a followup film in 24 hours to detect any
 clinically significant pneumothorax.  Small volume of left pleural fluid is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with substantial narrowing
 of what was presumably an upper mediastinal hematoma.
