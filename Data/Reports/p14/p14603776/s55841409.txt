                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 1:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post hematoma evacuation from a
 chest, evaluate for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 8:17.
 
 A portable supine chest film from ___ at 1:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of two left-sided chest tubes.  No large pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.  There is patchy opacity in the right upper lobe likely reflecting
 atelectasis given elevation of the minor fissure.  Patchy opacity at the left
 base also likely reflects an area of patchy atelectasis, although aeration at
 the left base has overall improved.  Stable widening of the mediastinal
 contours in this patient status post aortic surgery.  Heart remains upper
 limits of normal in size given portable technique.  Multiple rib fractures,
 unchanged.  Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized upper lumbar
 spine.  Prominent amount of gas within distended stomach.
