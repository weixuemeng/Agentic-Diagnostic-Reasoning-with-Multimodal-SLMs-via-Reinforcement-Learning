 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax with no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with
 persistent widening of the mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch in this
 patient status post previous surgery for aortic transsection.  Atelectasis in
 left retrocardiac region is again demonstrated, as well as a small left
 pleural effusion.  Within the right lung, an area of focal atelectasis in the
 right upper lobe has resolved, and minimal peribronchiolar opacities are
 present in the right infrahilar region, and may reflect atelectasis or focal
 aspiration.  Moderate gastric distention is noted in the imaged portion of the
 upper abdomen, as well as postoperative changes in the spine.
