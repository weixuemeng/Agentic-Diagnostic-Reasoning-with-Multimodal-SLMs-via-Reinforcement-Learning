 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:43 PM
  Extensive subcutaneous air overlying the thoracic/cervical region, as before.
  Left retrocardiac consolidation, likely the result of moderate atelectasis and
  adjacent pleural effusion, not significantly changed.  Blunting of left
  costophrenic angle, consistent with a small pleural effusion.  Heart size and
  mediastinal contours unchanged.  Right apical pleural thickening/fluid,
  unchanged.  Unchanged tiny left pneumothorax.  Oral contrast material in the
  esophagus and stomach.  Left posterior rib fracture, as before.  ___ wet
  read.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dropping saturations.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is still presence of contrast material within the esophagus and stomach
 related to recent barium administration.  Left retrocardiac consolidation is
 unchanged.  There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema
 which is still present.  Small pleural effusion is noted.  Subcutaneous air
 appears to be improved since the prior study.
