                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  The full right costophrenic angle is
 not included on the frontal image.  Given the above, no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
