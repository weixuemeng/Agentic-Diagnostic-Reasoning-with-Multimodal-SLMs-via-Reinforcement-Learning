                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for perforation.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the single upright view presented, there is no clear evidence of
 free intraperitoneal gas.  Continued dilatation of loops of bowel in the left
 upper quadrant, though on this view, it is somewhat difficult to determine
 whether they reflect large or small bowel.
