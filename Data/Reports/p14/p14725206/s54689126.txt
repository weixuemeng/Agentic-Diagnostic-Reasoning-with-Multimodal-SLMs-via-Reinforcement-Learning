                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever.  History of chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Abnormal mediastinal and right hilar
 contours appear similar to the prior scout view.  A focal opacity in the right
 upper lobe also appears unchanged allowing for differences in modality.  These
 findings are most consistent with stable malignant disease in the chest. 
 Small changes would not be easily detected with radiography, however. 
 Likewise, there are several nodules in the left lung which correlate generally
 with prior findings, although small to moderate differences would again be
 difficult to detect.  There is similar moderate relative elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably stable chest findings with no definite evidence for
 acute disease.  Background abnormalities limit assessment for any potential
 subtle pulmonary infection, however.
