                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multiple rib fractures, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Left hemithorax appears to be
 smaller in volume as compared to the right one, in part related to still
 displaced at least the three broken ribs, fifth, sixth and seventh.  There is
 small amount of left pleural effusion versus a pleural thickening.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Lungs are well aerated.
