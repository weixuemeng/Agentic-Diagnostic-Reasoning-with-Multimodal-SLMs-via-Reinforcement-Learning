                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 12:50 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cellulitis and spiking fever.  Look for
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Relative elevation of the left lung base could be due to small left
 subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Right lung clear.  Vascular crowding probably
 explains increased opacification at the base of the left lung.  Conventional
 PA and lateral chest radiographs would be definitive to exclude left basal
 pneumonia.  Heart size normal.  Right lung clear.  No right pleural
 abnormality.
