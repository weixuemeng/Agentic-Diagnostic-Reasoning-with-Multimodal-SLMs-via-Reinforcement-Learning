                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  There is no convincing evidence of apical pneumothorax on the left
 at this time, though the area is somewhat obscured by overlying bony elements.
 The left costophrenic angle shows mild blunting, though this could well be due
 to overlying soft tissues rather than post-procedure pleural effusion.
