                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New pacemaker.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the pacer leads.  The ventricular pacer has a somewhat more
 elevated position than frequently seen.  A lateral view would be most helpful
 to determine whether it definitely is within the right ventricle.
 
 No evidence of acute pneumonia.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists.
