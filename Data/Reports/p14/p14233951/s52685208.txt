                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, status post T-spine radiation, question aspiration pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 6:07 a.m.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The heart is mildly enlarged, with left
 ventricular configuration. Doubt CHF. There are opacities along both the mid
 chest wall, which are associated with known rib lesions.  There are small
 bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, which are
 both new compared with the film from one day earlier.  On today's exam, the
 previously seen area of opacity in the right lung apex is lucent.  
 
  Multiple bone lesions seen on the torso CT from ___ are not well
 visualized radiographically, but lucency in the presumptive T5 vertebral body
 likely is related to a vertebral body lesion demonstrated on that study. Poor
 visualization of the right third posterior rib near the midline could also
 reflect a focal bone lesion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 new compared with one day earlier.
 2.  Extensive bone metastases, best demonstrated on a CT from ___.
