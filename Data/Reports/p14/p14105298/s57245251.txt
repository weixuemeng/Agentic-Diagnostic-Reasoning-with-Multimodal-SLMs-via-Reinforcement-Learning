                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea with clinical concern for pneumonia, here to evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating
 in the right atrium and the right ventricle with the ventricular lead oriented
 superiorly towards the free wall of the right ventricle, as before.  There is
 increased interstitial thickening bilaterally on the right greater than the
 left consistent with worsening interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is
 substantial atelectasis if not complete collapse of the right lower lobe from
 ___.  Increased opacification of the right lung base silhouetting the
 diaphragm suggests increased small to moderate right pleural effusion.  There
 is slightly improved aeration at the left lung base with a persistent small
 pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Prominence of the aortic knob widening the mediastinal contour is unchanged,
 likely related to an unfolded thoracic aorta; however, aneurysmal dilatation
 of the thoracic aorta or dissection is not excluded.  This appearance is new
 from the remote prior ___ study but unchanged from ___.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening interstitial pulmonary edema from ___.
 2.  Increased substantial atelectasis or complete collapse of the right lower
 lobe from ___ with increased small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 3.  Prominence of the aortic arch unchanged from ___ but new from ___ may
 represent unfolding of the thoracic aorta or thoracic aortic aneurysm,
 although dissection is not excluded.
