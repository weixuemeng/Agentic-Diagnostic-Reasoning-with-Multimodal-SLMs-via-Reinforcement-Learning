 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aspiration pneumonia, shortness of breath, evaluation for new
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal decrease in extent of the left pleural effusion, constant in
 extent of the right pleural effusion (but the effusion is more medially
 located).  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette with only minimal signs of
 fluid overload.  No new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Unchanged
 pacemaker and right PICC line.
