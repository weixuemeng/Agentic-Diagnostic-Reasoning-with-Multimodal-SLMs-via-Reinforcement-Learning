                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral leg swelling and pleuritic chest
 pain.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 The lungs are clear of consolidation; subtle bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect overlying breast shadows.  Streaky atelectasis or scarring is present
 at the right lung base.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis or scarring, but otherwise normal
 chest.
