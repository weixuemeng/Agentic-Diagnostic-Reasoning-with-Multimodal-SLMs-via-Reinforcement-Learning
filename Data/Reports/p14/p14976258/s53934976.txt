                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cardiac amyloid and crackles at
 right base.  Evaluate for pneumonia on right side.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with next preceding chest examinations
 of ___ and ___.  Moderate degree of cardiomegaly remains. 
 No typical configurational abnormality is present but prominence of left
 ventricle and some enlargement of left atrial contours is quite obvious. 
 Thoracic aorta moderately widened and elongated but unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature shows an upper zone redistribution pattern and some perivascular
 haze on the bases.  Also observed is some remaining pleural effusion that
 blunts mildly the lateral pleural sinus on the right base.  No new parenchymal
 abnormalities are identified in comparison with the previous examinations. 
 Comparison further suggests that the pleural effusion has regressed.  Thus,
 the patient appears to be covering mildly from an episode of more marked CHF. 
 No new parenchymal infiltrates can be identified in comparison with the
 previous study.
