                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subtle increase in interstitial
 markings bilaterally may relate to underlying pulmonary emphysema although
 atypical infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal contours are unremarkable. Aortic
 calcification is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD. Subtle increase in interstitial markings bilaterally may relate to
 underlying pulmonary emphysema although atypical infection is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
