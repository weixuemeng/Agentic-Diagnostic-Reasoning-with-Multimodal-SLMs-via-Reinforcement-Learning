                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  Question cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are very low, but the findings suggest
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Within the limitations of technique which
 include AP view as well as high soft tissue attenuation, the mediastinal and
 hilar contours are likely within normal range and the lungs show no definite
 focal opacity.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  Limited examination, but no definite evidence for
 acute disease.
