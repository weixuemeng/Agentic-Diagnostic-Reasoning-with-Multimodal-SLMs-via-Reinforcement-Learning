                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations and left lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are patchy opacities at each lung base which are new since
 the prior radiographs.  Coinciding small-to-moderate pleural effusions are
 likely and better depicted on the lateral view.  There is a similar background
 coarsening of lung markings which may indicate airway inflammation or a state
 of chronic mild vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New pleural effusions and patchy opacities at the lung bases, for
 which atelectasis or pneumonia could be considered as etiologies.
