                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is somewhat
 ill-defined area of increased opacification at the right base on the frontal
 view, seen just behind the heart on the lateral projection, consistent with a
 right lower lobe pneumonia.  There is the vague suggestion of some ill-defined
 increased opacification at the left base as well, which could possibly
 represent a second focus of infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung pneumonia.
