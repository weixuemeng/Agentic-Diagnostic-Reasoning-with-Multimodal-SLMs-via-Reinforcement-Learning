                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:26 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Evaluate for effusion or infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has returned, after showing substantial
 improvement between ___ and ___ indicating that the changes
 over the past 48 hours are due to the recurrence of pulmonary edema. 
 Mediastinal widening, particularly in the right lower paratracheal region, is
 a longstanding finding previously documented as both adenopathy and azygous
 distention.  Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Heart size top
 normal.
 
 Some pneumonia, particularly atypical pneumonia could be present concurrently.
 
 Left internal jugular line follows the course of a tortuous left
 brachiocephalic vein, commonly seen in elderly patients, but I have discussed
 the possibility of arterial placement with the resident caring for this
 patient at the time of dictation.
