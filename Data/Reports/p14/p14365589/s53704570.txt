                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, elevated troponin, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report from chest radiograph ___.  Images are not
 available for direct comparison at this time.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 demonstrated.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal contours otherwise
 are unremarkable.  There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of
 compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen though assessment of the
 lung apices is somewhat obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over
 this region.  Deformity of the left proximal humerus is partially imaged and
 reflective of a remote healed fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
