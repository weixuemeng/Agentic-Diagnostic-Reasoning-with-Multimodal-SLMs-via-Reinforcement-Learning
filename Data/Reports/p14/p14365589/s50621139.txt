                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  The central catheter remains in place.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.  Continued
 distention of the azygos vein is also consistent with volume overload.
