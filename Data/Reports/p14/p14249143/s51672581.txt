                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with gastric cancer, h/o septic pulmonary emboli
 now short of breath.  // Please evaluate for etiology of shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest PA and lateral ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is a new opacity at the
 right lung base which may be asymmetric vascular congestion versus pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Significantly increased size of the
 cardiac silhouette may partly be due to AP, supine, and lordotic positioning
 and cardiomegaly in the setting of heart failure however a pericardial
 effusion may be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette may be partially due to positioning and
 cardiomegaly in the setting of heart failure however pericardial effusion may
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  New opacity at the right lung base may be asymmetric vascular congestion
 versus a pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
