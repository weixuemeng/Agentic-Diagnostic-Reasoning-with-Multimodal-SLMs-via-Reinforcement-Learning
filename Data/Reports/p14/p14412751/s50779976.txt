                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated but there are no focal opacities. 
 Thyroid enlargement as seen on a prior CT chest likely accounts for superior
 mediastinal enlargement.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
