                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New onset of lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 lung volumes are low.  There is new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 streaky basilar opacification.  The lateral view suggests perhaps a trace
 pleural effusion at least on the right.  A trace coinciding pleural effusion
 on the left is not excluded.  The thoracic spine curves mildly to the right. 
 An anterior flowing osteophyte is noted throughout the mid through lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacification with volume loss; differential
 considerations include pneumonia or substantial atelectasis.  Correlation with
 clinical presentation is recommended.
