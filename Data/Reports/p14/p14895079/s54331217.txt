                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large right pleural effusion probably responsible for large scale
 atelectasis, right middle and lower lobes. Severe new right pleural
 nodularity, particularly at the apex, concerning for metastasis. The midline
 position of the mediastinum despite the right pleural effusion indicates that
 the volume loss from atelectasis is equivalent, suggesting slow growth of the
 effusion, and/or that the mediastinum is fixed in position Tuberculosis is not
 excluded, but chest CT scanning would be helpful in characterizing the pleural
 abnormality.  Left lung is clear.
