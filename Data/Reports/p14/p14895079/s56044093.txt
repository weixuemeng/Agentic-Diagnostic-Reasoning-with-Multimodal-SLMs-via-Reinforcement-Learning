                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and shortness of breath, large
 pericardial effusion on echo  // eval for CHF, pneumonia      History of
 metastatic breast cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The large multiloculated right pleural effusion has continued to increase in
 size.  There is increasing opacity primarily involving the right mid and lower
 lung likely representing atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Stable faint rounded opacity at the right apex corresponds to loculated fluid
 and adjacent mass on recent CT.  Associated right pleural thickening and
 nodularity is better evaluated on the patient's prior CT examinations.  Right
 paratracheal soft tissue is consistent with known lymphadenopathy.  On the
 left, there is a small pleural effusion and associated partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The left upper and mid lung is grossly clear.  A right pigtail
 catheter is coiled at the right lung base.  Numerous surgical clips overlie
 the right axilla and the patient is status post right mastectomy.  No
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Interval enlargement of heart size since ___ consistent with known pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing right pleural effusion with increasing consolidation of the right
 lung most consistent with atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Interval appearance of left pleural effusion with associated partial lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Interval cardiac enlargement consistent with known
 pericardial effusion.  No pulmonary edema.
