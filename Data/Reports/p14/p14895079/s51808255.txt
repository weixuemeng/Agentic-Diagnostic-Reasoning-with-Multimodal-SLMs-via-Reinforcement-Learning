                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As far as I can tell, the right pleural drainage catheters are unchanged since
 ___.  Nevertheless there is new air in the right pleural space which is
 otherwise largely fluid filled.  If that was not introduced from the outside,
 it suggests developing bronchopleural fistula.
 
 Aeration in the right lung has improved, permitting demonstration of a right
 apical pleural mass, but it is still largely consolidated.
 
 Pericardial drainage catheter has been repositioned, partially withdrawn, now
 to the right of midline.  Size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed. 
 Previous left pigtail pleural drainage catheter has been removed.  There may
 be a small area of new consolidation developing at the base of the left lung.
