                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess lung nodules seen on Port-A-Cath placement.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Nodular opacity in the left perihilar
 region is likely a vascular structure.  A second nodular opacity projecting
 over the anterior left first rib is in unchanged  location and likely is a
 bone island.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Left
 Port-A-Cath tip is in the lower SVC.  Mild degenerative changes are in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 Shallow obliques are recommended to ensure that the nodular opacities are as
 described vascular and osseous structures.
 
 Findings were posted in the critical result reporting system to be conveyed to
 referring physician.
