                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Emphysema with cough and diminished right breath sounds.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with increased AP diameter
 of the chest, consistent with a clinical history of emphysema.  There is
 continued left pleural effusion with compressive atelectatic changes at the
 base.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Infusion port again extends to the mid portion
 of the SVC.
