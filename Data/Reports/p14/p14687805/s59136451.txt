                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  History of aspiration, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing pneumonia in
 the left lower lobe has substantially decreased in severity and extent. 
 However, remnant areas of parenchymal opacities are still visible, notably in
 the anterior parts of the left lower lobe (better visible on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph).  Slightly lower lung volumes.  An area of
 atelectasis is seen at the bases of the right upper lobe.  This area deserves
 special attention at further followups.  In general, radiographic followup
 until complete resolution is recommended.
