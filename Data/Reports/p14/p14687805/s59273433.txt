                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decreased breath sounds right base,
 cough/fatigue  // r/o infiltrate, r/o effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A 7.7 x 3.5 cm elliptical-shaped cavitary or cystic lesion is newly
 appreciated in the right juxta hilar region, corresponding to the superior
 segment right lower lobe on the lateral radiograph. Its appearance favors
 location within the lung rather than the pleura but this distinction is not
 certain.  Its superior wall is thin, but the other wall portions are thicker,
 measuring up to 1.6 cm medially. Additionally, there is an apparently new 1.9
 cm diameter nodular opacity in the right mid to lower lung at the level of the
 sixth anterior right ribs, not confidently localized on the lateral view.
 Bilateral lower lung predominant bronchial wall thickening and adjacent
 streaky opacities have worsened, and lungs remain hyperinflated consistent
 with history of COPD. Heart size remains normal, and aorta is mildly tortuous.
 Small pleural effusions are present, unchanged on the left but new on the
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New 7.7 cm elliptical cavitary/cystic lesion in superior segment right lower
 lobe as well as an adjacent lung nodule.  Findings could be due to infection
 including tuberculosis and fungal organisms, complicated aspiration pneumonia,
 and less likely an atypical manifestation of metastatic disease in this
 patient with history of gastric cancer.  Chest CT is recommended to better
 localize and characterize this process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 11:26 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
