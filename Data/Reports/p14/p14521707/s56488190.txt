                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman found down unknowntime, complicated respiratory
 failure s/p trach and peg  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior study of ___, the endotracheal tube
 has been removed, and is now been replaced with a tracheostomy tube.  The
 right-sided PICC line with does not appear to be significantly changed in
 position. There is opacification of the right upper lobe, which may represent
 fluid in the minor fissure the difficult to exclude developing consolidation
 in the right lobe. There is no pulmonary edema, significant pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to
 obliquity of the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, which is replaced with a
 tracheostomy tube.
 2.  Right upper lobe opacity, which may be due to fluid in the minor fissure. 
 Difficult to exclude developing RUL consolidation.  Recommend repeating CXR
 with better patient positioning to further evaluate.
