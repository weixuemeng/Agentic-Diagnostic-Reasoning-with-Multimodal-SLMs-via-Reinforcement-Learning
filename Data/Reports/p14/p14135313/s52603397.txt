                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with suspected right pneumonia, evaluate for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Series of radiographs dating back to ___, most recently from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in the
 semi-erect position.  Again, multiple fractures are noted on the right. 
 Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is persistence of right-sided
 opacifications, particularly in the mid right lung.  Left lung is clear.  No
 significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacification seen on the right is no longer explained
 by solely by a simple pulmonary contusion which appeared to be resolving on
 prior radiographs.  This finding is now more consistent with a pulmonary
 contusion/laceration that is complicated by pneumonia.
