                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple traumas complicated by right lower
 lobe pneumonia, now requiring assessment for interval change in the right
 lower lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate two circular
 opacities in the right lower lung which likely respresent loculated fluid in
 the major fissure.  A subpleural opacity in the right mid lung region is also
 seen, which likely represents loculated fluid, as well.  Previously seen
 pleural effusion on the right has improved and has nearly resolved.  There is
 no effusion or opacity in the left lung.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Orthopedic hardware is again noted on the right clavicle.  Several right rib
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Circular opacities in the right lower lung likely represent
 loculated fluid in major fissure.  Right subpleural opacity likely represents
 loculated fluid, as well.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 4:55 p.m.
