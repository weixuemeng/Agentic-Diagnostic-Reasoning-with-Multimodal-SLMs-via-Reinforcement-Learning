                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right pneumothorax status post chest tube
 placement.  Evaluate chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day CT torso.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, portable AP upright.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 A right pleural tube enters the right lateral chest wall and appears somewhat
 kinked along its upper curvature.  No obvious pneumothorax.  Patchy right lung
 opacities are compatible with pulmonary contusion or potentially hemorrhage. 
 Numerous fractures, including right distal clavicle, several right ribs, and
 right scapula are seen, described in detail on same-day CT torso.  Extensive
 right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right pleural tube without increase in
 pneumothorax.  Patchy right lung opacities, slightly increased since prior. 
 Extensive right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
