                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Trauma chest radiograph from earlier the same date and CT torso
 from earlier the same date.  Note that these exams are under a separate record
 number (___) and have not yet been merged with the current record number.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of right-sided chest tube terminating at the
 level of the right sixth posterior rib, with a persistent small right apical
 pneumothorax at the level of the right third posterior rib level.  Multiple
 contiguous rib fractures are present from the second to the seventh rib level,
 including at least one segmental fracture, concerning for flail chest. 
 Widespread consolidation in the right lung has slightly worsened, and
 persistent subcutaneous emphysema is also demonstrated.  Circular lucencies in
 the right mid and lower lung are consistent with pulmonary laceration injury.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique.  Left lung
 and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 Additional traumatic injuries are demonstrated with the right clavicular and
 scapular fractures, shown to better detail on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place. Right apical cap
 is likely a combination of extrapleural hematoma and known hemothorax detected
 on recent CT.
 
 2.  Extensive consolidation in the right lung likely due to widespread
 pulmonary contusion.  Cystic lucencies in the mid and lower lung are
 consistent with laceration injury in the setting of recent trauma.
 
 3.  Contiguous right rib fractures concerning for flail chest.
