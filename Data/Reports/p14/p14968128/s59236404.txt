                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  Additionally, there appears to be
 right apical pleural thickening.  Relative patchy opacity in the right lung
 apex is felt to most likely be chronic and due to scarring.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, infectious process is not excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right biapical pleural thickening.  Streaky opacity in the right
 upper lung is felt to most likely be chronic possibly due to scarring. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  No priors for comparison.  Consider AP lordotic view for further
 evaluation or comparison with any priors.
