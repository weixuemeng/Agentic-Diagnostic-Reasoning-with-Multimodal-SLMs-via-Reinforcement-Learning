                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a moderate sized right
 pleural effusion with loculated intra fissural component has possibly slightly
 decreased in size, although positional differences between the exams limit
 comparison.  With the exception of adjacent atelectasis at the right lung
 base, the remainder of the lungs are clear.
