                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  Surgical clips also project over the right axilla.  The heart
 appears borderline in size.  There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid
 level and some distension.  Streaky opacities in the left infrahilar region
 can probably be attributed to atelectasis in association with the hernia. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia including mild distention and an air-fluid level. 
 Although this may be incidental to the clinical presentation, the possibility
 that this may relate to symptoms could be considered depending on clinical
 circumstances.
