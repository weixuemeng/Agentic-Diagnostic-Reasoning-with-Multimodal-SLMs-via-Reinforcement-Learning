                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Continued  pleuritic left pains after trans-bronchial
 biopsy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Substantial improvement of the left infrahilar and lower lung opacity is
 demonstrated, most likely reflecting residue of the post-biopsy changes. Still
 present new perihilar density is most likely related to post-bronchoscopy
 changes as well.    No definitive pneumothorax is seen. No appreciable pleural
 effusion is seen.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
