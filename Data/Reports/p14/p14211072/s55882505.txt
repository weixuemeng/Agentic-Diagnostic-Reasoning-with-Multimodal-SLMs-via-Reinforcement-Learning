                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dysphagia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three AP portable upright views.
 
 COMPARISON:  These views depict ongoing advancement of a feeding tube with a
 weighted tip which, on the final film, terminates to the right of midline
 probably in the gastric antrum. There is a biliary stent projecting over the
 right upper quadrant as well as clips probably due to prior cholecystectomy.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Vague opacity projecting over region of otherwise
 unchanged rib fractures suggests mild associated pleural thickening at that
 site. Otherwise, lung fields appear clear.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Feeding tube terminating in the gastric antrum.
