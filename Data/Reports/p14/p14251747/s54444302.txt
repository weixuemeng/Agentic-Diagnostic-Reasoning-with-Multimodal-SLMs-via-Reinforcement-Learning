                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post RML.  Study requested for evaluation
 of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 partial obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and there is a small
 right-sided pleural effusion. There is also a new area of increased opacity at
 the right lung base which could be related to volume loss. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, these findings could also reflect early
 pneumonia.  The left lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at right lung base with partial obscuration of
 the right hemidiaphragm, which could be related to volume loss and to pleural
 fluid.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, early pneumonia should
 also be considered.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 11:47 a.m., at time of discovery.
