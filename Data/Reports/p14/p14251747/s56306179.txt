                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right middle lobectomy, assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Right subcutaneous chest wall air has resolved.
 Increased density in the right infrahilar area may be post-procedure change,
 although this development several days after the procedure is not typical.
 Slightly increased lung markings in the right mid and lower lung persist and
 may be post-procedure change.  Air-filled dilated loops of bowel in the upper
 abdomen are incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Increased right infrahilar density with persistent increased interstitial
 markings over the right mid and lower lung. Post-procedure changes are
 possible, but their appearance several days afterwards is less likely.
 Pneumonia or aspiration are also possible in the correct clinical setting.
 Close attention on follow up is recommeded.
