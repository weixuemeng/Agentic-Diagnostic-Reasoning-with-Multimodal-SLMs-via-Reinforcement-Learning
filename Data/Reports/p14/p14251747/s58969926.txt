                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the right chest tube with
 improvement in right pneumothorax. The lateral component of the pneumothorax
 is not present, and the apical portion is small if present. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Lung volumes are lower, which may account for new left basilar
 atelectasis. Right chest wall subcutaneous air remains.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical pneumothorax small if present.
