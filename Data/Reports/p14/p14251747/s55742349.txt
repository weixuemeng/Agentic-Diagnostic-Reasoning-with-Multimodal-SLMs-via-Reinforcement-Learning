                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, fever, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Approximately 2 cm focal opacity within the
 right lung base was not clearly identified on the prior study, and could
 reflect an area of infection, inflammation, or neoplasm.  There is adjacent
 linear scarring.  Left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nonspecific focal opacity within the right lung base could reflect an area of
 infection, inflammation, or neoplasm.  Followup radiographs are recommended
 after treatment, and if this finding persists, then a dedicated chest CT is
 suggested.
