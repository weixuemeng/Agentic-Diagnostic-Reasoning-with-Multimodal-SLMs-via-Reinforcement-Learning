                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea.  Exam with rales at
 the left lower lobe.  Evaluate for pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Linear left lower lobe opacities
 identified.  The right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  The heart size is top normal. The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no free air beneath the diaphragm.  No acute osseous or soft
 tissue abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Linear opacities in the left lower lobe likely represent
 atelectasis although infection is note entirely excluded.
