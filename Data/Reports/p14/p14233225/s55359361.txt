                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, p/w UGIB  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ catheter is unchanged in position.  There are increasing right
 mid and lower, and left upper parenchymal opacities, which may represent
 multifocal pneumonia, however the rapid increased in severity suggests ARDS,
 aspiration, or hemorrhage.  The linear opacity within the left lower lung
 likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion.  Cardiac size is difficult to evaluate.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate position of right IJ catheter.
 2. Increasing bilateral parenchymal opacities, which is concerning for ARDS,
 aspiration, or hemorrhage, with multifocal pneumonia being less likely.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:58 AM, 5 minutes
