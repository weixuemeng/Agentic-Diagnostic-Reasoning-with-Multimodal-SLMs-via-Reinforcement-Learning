                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with history of asthma presenting with fever and upper
 respiratory symptoms.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded.  There are diffuse increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally, with a reticular pattern of opacity more
 pronounced in the mid and low lungs bilaterally, but no focal opacity. 
 Cardiac size is normal. The mediastinum appears widened secondary to unfolded
 aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema although
 atypical pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Correlate with subsequent
 chest CT.
