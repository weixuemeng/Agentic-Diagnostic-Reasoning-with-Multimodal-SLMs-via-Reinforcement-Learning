                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided PICC line terminates in the mid-to-lower superior vena
 cava.  The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal size.  Trace
 pleural effusions are suspected based on blunting of posterior costophrenic
 sulci and slight fullness of lateral sulci.  However, the lung fields appear
 clear.  Given technique, cardiac and mediastinal contours are probably within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace suspected pleural effusions.  Clear lungs.
