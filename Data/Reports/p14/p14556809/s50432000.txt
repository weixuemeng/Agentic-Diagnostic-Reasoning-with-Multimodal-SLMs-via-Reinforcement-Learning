                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the previous study. Left-sided AICD device is
 noted with single lead terminating in unchanged position in the right
 ventricle. Heart size appears at least mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
