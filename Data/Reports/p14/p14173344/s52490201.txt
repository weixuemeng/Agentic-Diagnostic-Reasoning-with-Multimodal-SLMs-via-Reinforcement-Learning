  Focal right midlung opacity with less well-defined hazy left mid to lower lung
  opacities.  While some this may be accounted for by atelectasis, there is
  suspected superimposed infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough, fever  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  There is somewhat linear right midlung
 opacity with more hazy opacity projecting over the left midlung.  While some
 of this may be due to atelectasis given low lung volumes, superimposed
 infection would certainly be possible.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal right midlung opacity with less well-defined hazy left mid to lower lung
 opacities.  While some this may be accounted for by atelectasis, there is
 suspected superimposed infection.
