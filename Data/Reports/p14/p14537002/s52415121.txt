 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with an outside hospital chest radiograph from same date earlier
 today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  GI bleed, assess for position of the NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The tip of the
 NG tube resides in the left upper quadrant.  The lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal with atherosclerotic calcifications
 again noted at the aortic knob.  Bony structures are intact.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature
 suggesting underlying emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube positioned appropriately.
