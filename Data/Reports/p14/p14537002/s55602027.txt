 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in

 next preceding similar study ___ ___.  Previously described left
 subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. 
 Previously present endotracheal tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  The previously identified NG tube is again seen and reaches now
 further down below the diaphragm indicating its position in a distended
 stomach.  There is status post recent abdominal surgery with cutaneous sutures
 in the midline and one drainage tube terminating in the fundus area of the
 stomach.  The heart size has not changed, and no pulmonary congestion has
 developed.  There exist, however, hazy densities bilaterally in the lung bases

 ___ indicates stable findings.  No new parenchymal infiltrates have
 developed, but the crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the
