                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for position of NG tube.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach, but the side port is at the level of the EG
 junction.  ET tube is in standard position.  Right lower lobe opacities have
 improved from one hour earlier.  Left perihilar opacities are new, worrisome
 for aspiration.  Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
