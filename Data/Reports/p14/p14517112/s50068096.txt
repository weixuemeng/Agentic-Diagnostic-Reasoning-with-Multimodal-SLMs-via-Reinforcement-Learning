 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever  // eval for PNA
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 There are no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Dense consolidation in the right upper lobe is probably pneumonia.  This needs
 to be followed to exclude another condition such as bronchogenic carcinoma. 
 Tiny right pleural effusion may be present.  There is no left pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart is normal size and pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not clearly dilated.
 
 There is narrowing of the airway at an below the colitis suggesting local
 edema.  This may be due to recent intubation or laryngitis.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
