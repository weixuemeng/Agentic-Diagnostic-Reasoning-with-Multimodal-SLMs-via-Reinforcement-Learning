                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate fairly well aerated lungs
 and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No focal consolidation is
 identified, but there is increased perihilar opacity, which could represent a
 viral or small airways process, or mild vascular congestion. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased perihilar opacity, which could represent a viral or small airways
 process, or mild vascular congestion. No focal consolidation to suggest
 bacterial pneumonia identified.
 2. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
