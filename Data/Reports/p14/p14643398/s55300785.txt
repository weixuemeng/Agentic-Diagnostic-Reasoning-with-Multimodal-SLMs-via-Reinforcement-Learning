 evaluate for effusion, infiltrate, volume status, PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low with bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 suspected superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural
 effusion, although blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle could
 indicate small effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable given
 differences in technique and positioning.  No acute osseous abnormalities.

 superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
