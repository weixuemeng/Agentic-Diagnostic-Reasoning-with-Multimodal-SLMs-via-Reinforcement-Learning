                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New left pectoral pacemaker has two leads.  The first one is in adequate
 position in the right atrium, the second one seems to be high for a
 ventricular lead.  If it was not intended to be in the sinus coronary, a
 standard PA and lateral chest x-ray is suggested to assess the exact position.
 The lung volumes are low.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient had new left-sided pacemaker placement.  The atrial lead is in
 adequate position.  The second lead is slightly superior than expected for a
 ventricular position.  A standard PA and lateral chest x-ray has been
 suggested to Dr. ___.
