 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with again the second lead slightly
 superior than expected for ventricular position, stable.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable and grossly stable in
 configuration given differences in lung volume.  Partially imaged right
 humeral prosthesis is seen.  Thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
