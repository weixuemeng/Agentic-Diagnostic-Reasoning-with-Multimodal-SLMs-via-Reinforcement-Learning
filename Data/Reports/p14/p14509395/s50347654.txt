  New bilateral parenchymal opacities, more extensive on the left than on the
  right.  Clinical correlation will be necessary.  Infection is possible in the
  proper clinical setting.  Underlying malignancy is not excluded.  If
  appropriate, treatment for infection is suggested with follow-up imaging to
  document resolution.  If symptoms are less compatible with infection,
  additional imaging could be performed at this time for further assessment.
