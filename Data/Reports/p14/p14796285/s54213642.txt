                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pacemaker placement, here to evaluate lead placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker has been placed with dual leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The course of the leads
 is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged,
 but stable.  A coronary stent is noted, likely within the left circumflex. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is a
 compression deformity of an upper-to-mid thoracic vertebral body with severe
 kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at that level.  Multilevel moderate
 degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pectoral pacemaker with dual leads in appropriate position.
