                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, pulling back of pulmonary artery
 catheter.  Evaluation for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 0:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pulmonary artery
 catheter has been pulled back.  However, catheter is still coiled in the
 outflow tract of the right ventricle and requires undelayed reposition.
 
 The other monitoring and support devices are in constant position.  Constant
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, the extent of the known right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.
