                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion after thoracentesis, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There is some
 opacification at the right base medially.  This could well represent merely
 crowding of vessels.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 There is mild prominence of the azygos region.  This could be a manifestation
 of right-sided heart failure.
