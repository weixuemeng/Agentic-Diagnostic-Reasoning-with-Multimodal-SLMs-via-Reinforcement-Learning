                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chills, liver cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A
 moderate to large right pleural effusion is noted with right basilar patchy
 opacity likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Minimal left basilar
 atelectasis is also noted.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion with right basilar patchy opacity
 most likely reflective of compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be
 completely excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
