                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of HCV, now
 status post orthotopic liver transplantation.  Has hepatic hydrothorax status
 post thoracocentesis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to radiograph performed same day there is substantial
 interval decrease in size of right-sided pleural effusion, now only small. 
 Improved aeration of the left lower lobe is also noted.  Streaky residual
 retrocardiac opacifications likely reflect atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  
 
 A rightsided central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.
 Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  Enteric catheter
 courses below left hemidiaphragm and out of view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked decrease in size of right pleural effusion, now small in
 size.  Improved aeration of left lung.  
 Rightsided central venous catheter, now terminating in the right atrium. If
 the intended position was distal SVC/cavoatrial junction, recommend withdrawal
 3-4 cm.
