                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of diabetes with known foot ulcers, now with fever, here
 to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes with marginal osteophyte formation of the thoracic spine
 are noted with mild dextroconvex curvature of the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 Deformity of the right lateral ribs may be related to prior fracture.  No
 acute displaced rib fractures are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process, specifically no pneumonia.
 2.  Deformity of the right lateral ribs likely related to prior fractures.
