                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status hypotension, hx
 aspiration  // Evidence of PNA, aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is minimally unfolded.  There is no CHF. 
 Minimal hazy retrocardiac opacity  likely relates to left base atelectasis. 
 No frank consolidation is identified.  Elsewhere, no focal opacity is seen. 
 Small focus of subsegmental atelectasis noted at the right lung base.  .  No
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild hazy opacity in the retrocardiac region, question due to atelectasis,
 though an early infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis could
 have a similar appearance.   If clinically indicated, a lateral view could
 help for further characterization.
 
 Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
