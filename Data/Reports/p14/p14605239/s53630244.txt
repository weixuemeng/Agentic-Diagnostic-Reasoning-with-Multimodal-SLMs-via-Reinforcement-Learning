                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new large left suprahilar mass like density centered in
 the right upper lobe, measuring approximately 6 cm in extent.  Its contours
 appear lobular.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left suprahilar mass worrisome for malignancy.  Rounded
 lobular contour makes an infectious or inflammatory etiology less likely based
 on radiography.  Evaluation with chest CT, preferably with intravenous
 contrast if possible, is suggested to assess further when clinically
 appropriate.
