                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with EtOH intoxication, fall with LOC, right frontal
 hematoma, GCS ___  // ?bleed/fx
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.
 
 Allowing for this, no definite cardiomediastinal enlargement.  Upper zone
 redistribution is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  Mild
 peribronchial thickening is noted adjacent to the left hilum.  There is patchy
 opacity of both lung bases.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion.
 
 No displaced rib fracture detected on these lung technique films.
 
 Mild multilevel degenerative changes noted in the visualized portion of the
 spine.  AC joint degenerative changes noted bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Patchy opacities at both lung bases.  While this could represent atelectasis
 related to low inspiratory volumes, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 changes due to aspiration and early pneumonic infiltrates could have a similar
 appearance.
 
 Doubt overt CHF.  No effusion.
 
 No displaced rib fracture detected on these lung technique films.
