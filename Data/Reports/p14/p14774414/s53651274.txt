                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New O2 requirement, question atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:38 a.m.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker/AICD device is present.   
 
 There is probable background COPD.  There is prominent cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, with cardiac enlargement and prominent unfolding/tortuosity of the
 aorta -- this is essentially unchanged compared with ___.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.  A curvilinear density seen at
 the left base appears to relate to the left ventricle and could represent a
 calcified thrombus or a calcified area of the aneurysm.  (Targeted review of a
 chest CT from ___ has demonstrated calcified left ventricular aneurysm
 involving the anterior wall and interventricular septum.)
 
 Compared with the prior film, there is some new patchy opacity at the right
 base, which could reflect either atelectasis or an early pneumonia.  Subtle
 changes were seen in this location on the ___ radiograph, but they are
 slightly more prominent on the current exam.  There is minimal atelectasis or
 scarring at the left base, unchanged.  Otherwise, no focal opacities detected.
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular fullness, without overt
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in the degree of opacity at the right base, ? atelectasis
 versus early pneumonic infiltrate.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate is
 identified.
 
 2.  Mild vascular plethora.
 
 3.  Calcified left ventricular aneurysm again noted.
