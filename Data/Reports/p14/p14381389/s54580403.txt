                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p mvr and CT removal  // r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR performed yesterday afternoon, there has been interval
 removal of the right chest tube, pulmonary artery catheter, enteric tube and
 endotracheal tube.  The right IJ introducer is still in place.
 
 The bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions appear to have increased in
 size since yesterday.  Hazy opacification of the right apex is likely due to
 layering of the right effusion, but resolution must be confirmed with
 follow-up chest radiographs. No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval removal of several support lines and devices, as described above.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear to have increased.
 3.  Hazy right apical opacity, likely due to layering effusion.  However,
 resolution must be confirmed with follow-up CXR.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings telephoned to ___ NP by Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:10AM, approximately 10 minutes after discovery.
