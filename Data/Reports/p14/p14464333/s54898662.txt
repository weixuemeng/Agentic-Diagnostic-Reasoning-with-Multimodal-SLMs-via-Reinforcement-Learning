 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the predominantly basal and
 perihilar parenchymal opacities have minimally increased in extent.  Better
 seen than on the previous radiograph are areas of bronchial cuffing, making a
 combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia the most likely diagnosis.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  The course of the left central venous access line is unchanged.
