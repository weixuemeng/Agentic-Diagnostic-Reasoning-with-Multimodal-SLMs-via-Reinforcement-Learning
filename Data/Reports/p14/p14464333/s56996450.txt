                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement is accompanied by asymmetrically distributed
 perihilar and basilar opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree
 than the left.  Additionally, several thickened septal lines are present in
 the lung periphery, and small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.  The
 asymmetric distribution is similar to an earlier radiograph of ___.  Asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema is considered most likely,
 but followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude a pneumonia
 if warranted clinically.
