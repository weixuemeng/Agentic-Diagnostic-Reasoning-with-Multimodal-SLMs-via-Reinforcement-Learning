                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trapped in O2 saturation after bronchoscopy, associated with chills.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest port which
 terminates in the mid SVC.  Apparent increase in size of the heart may be
 secondary to portable supine technique.  Right upper lobe and lower lobe
 opacities are consistent with lesion seen on recent CT chest.  A retrocardiac
 opacity could be secondary to atelectatic change, but superimposed pneumonia
 can be considered.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity could be secondary to atelectatic changes, but
 superimposed pneumonia is a consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 
 2.  Right upper lobe and lower lobe opacities are consistent with lesions seen
 on recent CT chest. 
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___, upon discovery.
