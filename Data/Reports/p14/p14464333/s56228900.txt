                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  AML and neutropenic fever.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is an ill-defined opacity seen
 at the anterior left third rib that could represent superimposition of normal
 structures or a lung opacity/consolidation or infectious process given
 technical concern, CT can be performed.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Two small nodular opacities in the lateral left lower lobe are new;
 also can be evaluated with CT.
 
 Findings discussed by phone at the time of discovery with team.
