                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with concern for infection or lymphadenopathy.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion. Vaugely increased density at the right lower lobe may
 represent bronchovascular crowding in the setting of poor inspiratory effort.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A repeat chest radiograph with better inspirator effort is
 recommended to assess a vague right lower lobe density, to exclude possible
 consolidation.
 
 The findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 8:05
 AM on ___.
