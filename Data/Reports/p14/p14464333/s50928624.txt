                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe rales, question infiltrate versus fluid.  AML renal
 failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Left subclavian central line unchanged.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is prominence of the
 vascular and/or interstitial markings at both bases and in right greater than
 left suprahilar areas.  Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle is
 probably unchanged.  No upper zone redistribution.  The markings are more
 pronounced than on the film from ___, 14:03 p.m., but in retrospect early
 changes may have been present on that film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased vascular/interstitial markings in the perihilar and
 medial bases bilaterally.  Differential diagnosis includes an atypical
 distribution of CHF or an interstitial infectious or inflammatory process.
