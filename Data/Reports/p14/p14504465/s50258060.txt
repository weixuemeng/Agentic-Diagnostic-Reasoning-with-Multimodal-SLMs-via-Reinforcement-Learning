                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT abdomen and pelvis from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large right pleural effusion likely has a subpulmonic component. 
 It has apparently increased in size since the ___ chest radiograph,
 and is more fully quantified on the recent abdominal CT performed about one
 hour after the chest radiograph and dictated separately under clip ___. 
 Adjacent atelectasis is present in the right middle and right lower lobe.  The
 effusion is associated with slight shift of the cardiomediastinal contours
 towards the left.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Please see a
 separately dictated abdominal CT from later today, which more fully evaluates
 the effusion.
