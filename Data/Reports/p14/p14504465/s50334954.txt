                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis and hydrothorax, right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and the presence of a
 mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  The effusion is better visualized on
 the lateral than on the frontal image.  As a consequence of the effusion,
 there is minimal right basal atelectasis.  The lung parenchyma shows no
 evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Normal size of the hilar structures.  Minimal deviation of the trachea
 to the right may be caused by retrosternal goiter.  The lateral image also
 suggests height reduction of several vertebral bodies.  This might be better
 evaluated with radiograph of the thoracic spine.
