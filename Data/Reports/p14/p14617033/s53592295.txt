                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confirmation of lead position in a patient status post
 percutaneous pacemaker placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and
 compared to the prior study.  A dual-chamber pacemaker is seen over the left
 hemithorax with leads extending into the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Median sternotomy wires and clips along the left mediastinal contour are
 likely from prior cardiac surgery.  The lung fields are clear.  Bilateral
 blunting of the costophrenic angles is unchanged since ___ and likely
 represents chronic small pleural effusions or pleural thickening.  There is no
 pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
 
 The bones and soft tissues are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker leads ending in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
