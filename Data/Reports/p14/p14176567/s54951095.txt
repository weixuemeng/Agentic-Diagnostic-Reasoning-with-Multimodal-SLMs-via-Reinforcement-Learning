                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hip fracture, tachycardia and hypoxia  // ?
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 23:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and increased
 interstitial markings, more pronounced in the right lung, though with relative
 sparing of the left upper zone.  There is atelectasis and/or scarring at the
 right lung base.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial markings right-greater-than-left.  Possible slight
 improvement in the left upper and mid zones.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could reflect the presence of CHF, but the differential
 diagnosis includes other interstitial processes.  Of note, the ___
 chest CT shows evidence for chronic changes in lung that could contribute to
 this appearance.
 2. No frank alveolar opacity.  No gross effusion.
 3. The opacity at the right base is somewhat more confluent -- probable
 atelectasis, but an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
