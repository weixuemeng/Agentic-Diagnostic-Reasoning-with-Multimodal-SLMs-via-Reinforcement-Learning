                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M admitted w/ GI bleed and acute on chronic anemia c/b demand
 ischemia and diminished EF, now with signs of volume overload in the setting
 of held diuretic for AOC kidney injury  // Interval worsening of pulmonary
 edema; comment on c/f pulm hemorrhage vs PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. The
 parenchymal opacities, left more than right, have minimally decreased in
 extent and severity.  Although the heart is slightly enlarged and the
 diameters of the vessels are increased, the asymmetry of the changes is more
 likely to reflect pneumonia than pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax. The alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged.
