                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 845 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with E. coli sepsis, worsening cough,
 question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior studies dated ___ at 551.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 845 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to patient's marked
 rotation as well as fact that the patient has had a right pneumonectomy, and
 there is some mediastinal and cardiac shift to that side.  The left lung
 appears to have an evolving opacity at the left base, which would be
 suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration or possibly worsening atelectasis.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. Possible small layering left effusion.
