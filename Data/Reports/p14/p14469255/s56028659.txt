                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Crackles, shortness of breath, assess pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There has been
 prior right pneumonectomy with rightward shift of midline structures and
 residual aeration within the right upper lung.  There is subtle improvement in
 the opacity previously detected within the left mid and upper lung, though
 persistent opacity suggests residual pneumonia.  Otherwise, no significant
 change.
