                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient rotation slightly limits assessment. A large right pleural effusion
 has increased in size compared to the most recent prior exam.  There is
 associated right basilar atelectasis.  The heart size is not enlarged.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present.  Minimal streaky opacity in
 the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  An abdominal drain is seen
 which terminates in the right upper quadrant, where there is relative lucency,
 new from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased right pleural effusion which is large in extent.  Associated
 right basilar atelectasis.  
 
 2. Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal left basilar
 atelectasis.
 
 3.  New lucency overlying the right upper quadrant, adjacent to an abdominal
 drain.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
