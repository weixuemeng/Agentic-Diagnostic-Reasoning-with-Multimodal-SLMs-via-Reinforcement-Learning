 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:57 PM
  The right sided pigtail catheter has been advanced and now demonstrates more
  standard curvature of the distal portion.  A right subdiaphragmatic drain is
  also still present.  There is a persistent right pleural effusion and right
  basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pigtail insertion.  Check position.
 
 CHEST, 1 AP PORTABLE VW
 
 A pigtail catheter is present at the right lung base.  Compared with ___
 CXR, the tube has been advanced and the pigtail is more tightly looped, now
 overlying the region of the right cardiophrenic angle.  Again seen is an
 additional catheter overlying the right lung base or right upper abdomen. 
 Again seen is a small right effusion similar to the prior chest x-ray, with
 apparent slight increase in the degree of collapse/consolidation at the right
 lung base.  Slight upper zone re-distribution is stable, without other
 evidence of CHF, and could relate to low lung volumes.  Minimal atelectasis at
 the left base.  The left effusion appears smaller.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Pigtail catheter has been advanced and is now more tightly coiled.
 Slight interval increase in collapse/consolidation at right base. No ptx
 identified.
