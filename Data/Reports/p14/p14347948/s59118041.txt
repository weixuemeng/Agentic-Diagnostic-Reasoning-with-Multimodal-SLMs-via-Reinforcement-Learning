                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:34 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, hypotensive and hypoxia with large pleural
 effusion drained by pigtail catheter following abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Moderate residual right pleural effusion is probably unchanged since ___,
 pigtail pleural catheter also unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax.  In the
 setting of chronic vascular engorgement and mild cardiomegaly, greater
 opacification in the right mid and lower lung zone could be a combination of
 atelectasis and early edema.  Radiographically, I cannot exclude infection,
 but I saw no findings on ___ to suggest pneumonia.
