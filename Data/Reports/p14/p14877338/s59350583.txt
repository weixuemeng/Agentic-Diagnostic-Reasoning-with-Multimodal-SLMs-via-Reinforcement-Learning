                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  The extensive consolidation involving the
 right lung persists.  However, engorgement of the pulmonary vessels suggests
 that some of the opacification bilaterally reflects elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
