                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.  The patient
 is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is widespread opacification of the right lung with a dense
 right infrahilar opacity.  A lesser degree of airspace disease is noted in the
 left lung with a more patchy distribution.  Mild biapical pleural thickening
 is present.  Trace pleural effusions are suspected bilaterally.  There is no
 evidence for pneumothorax. 
   
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread airspace disease with considerable asymmetry, much
 more severe on the right than left.  Asymmetry and confluent focal right
 infrahilar opacity suggests pneumonia as the likely etiology.  Short-term
 followup radiographs are suggested.  Endotracheal tube terminates at the
 thoracic inlet.
