                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of COPD.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright frontal view of the chest.  Increased interstitial
 marking are suggestive of vascular congestion and mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  A focal opacity in the left mid lung could be edema or superimposed
 infection.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic knob
 is relatively unchanged since ___.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.   There is no acute osseous abnormality.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  A focal opacity in the left
 mid lung could be edema or superimposed infection.  PA and lateral views when
 the patient is amenable may help better characterize.
