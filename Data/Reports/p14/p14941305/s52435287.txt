 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta with minimal calcification at the aortic knob.  The lungs are
 hyperexpanded, with mild flattening of the diaphragms, indicative of COPD. 
 Mild blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulcus may suggests small
 bilateral pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema is seen. No consolidation,
 or pneumothorax is detected.  Mild kyphosis is seen in the thoracic spine.
