 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of basoapical blood flow re-distribution and increase in diameter of the
 pulmonary vessels.  Overall, the findings are suggestive of mild pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses could suggest the
 presence of minimal pleural effusion.  Unchanged borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
