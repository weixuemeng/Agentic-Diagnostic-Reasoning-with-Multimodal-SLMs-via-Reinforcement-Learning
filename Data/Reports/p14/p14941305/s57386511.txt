 HISTORY:  History of CHF presenting with increased shortness of breath.

 FINDINGS:
 
 The previously described focal opacity in the mid left lung is again seen and
 is smaller and more discrete in appearance.  There are multiple small
 opacities throughout both lung fields which possibly represent a multifocal
 infectious process.  There is cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.  The
 pleural surfaces are within normal limits and no effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Also seen is a compression fracture of the thoracic spine, unchanged in
 appearance from the chest radiograph on ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Multiple small opacities throughout both lung fields that possibly
 represent a multifocal infectious process.
