 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.

 no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  Levoscoliosis is similar to prior.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Small hiatal hernia was better evaluated on
 prior CT.

 No pneumonia.
