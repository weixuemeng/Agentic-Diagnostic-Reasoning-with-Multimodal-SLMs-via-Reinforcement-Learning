                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, sweats, abdominal pain, crackles at lung bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Blunting of
 one of the costophrenic angles on the lateral view indicates a small pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes are seen.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis with small pleural effusion, possibly
 bilateral.  Infection cannot be excluded in correct clinical setting.
