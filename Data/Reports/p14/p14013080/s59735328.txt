                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  There is
 persistent collapse of the right upper lobe.  A moderate-to-large pleural
 effusion has substantially decreased in size.  There is no definite
 pneumothorax.  The left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Substantial decrease in right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Persistent right upper lobe collapse worrisome for
 post-obstructive pneumonitis.  The possibility of underlying central
 malignancy to explain this appearance should be considered.
