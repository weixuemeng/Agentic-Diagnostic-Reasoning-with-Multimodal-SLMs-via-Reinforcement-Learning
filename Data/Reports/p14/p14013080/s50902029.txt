                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pericardial effusion on ultrasound.  Evaluate for
 acute lung process and pericardial effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs, most recently from ___. 
 CT angiogram of the chest from ___.  
 
 Compared to the most recent prior radiograph, there is increased right lower
 lobe consolidation along with prominent interstitial markings as seen on the
 comparison CT.  There is a persistent loculated right pleural effusion.  The
 right upper lobe continues to be collapsed.  There has been interval increase
 in the size of the cardiac silhouette, explained by the pericardial effusion
 noted in the requisition.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased size of cardiac silhouette likely secondary to pericardial
 effusion.
 2.  Interval worsening of interstitial and airspace opacity in the right lower
 lobe, concerning for pneumonia given the rapidity of progression.
 3.  Persistent loculated right pleural effusion with ongoing collapse of the
 right upper lobe.
