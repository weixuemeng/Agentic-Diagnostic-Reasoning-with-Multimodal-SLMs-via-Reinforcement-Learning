 HISTORY:  Severe MDS.  ___ for stem cell transplant.  Long history of
 recurrent presumed COP.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest again demonstrate
 coarse interstitial opacities throughout both lungs. As compared to prior
 chest CT from ___, there is no change. As compared to ___,
 there is no change. The abnormality is diffuse, involving both upper lobes and
 the right middle lobe, and may be COP, but is likely not an infectious process
 due to its stability over time. The appearance on the current radiograph is
 attributable to scarring.  No focal consolidation is identified.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Mild biapical thickening is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chronic bilateral interstitial opacities with no evidence
 of acute consolidation.
