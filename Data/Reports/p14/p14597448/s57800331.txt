  Persistent bilateral scattered areas of parenchymal opacities part of which
  have nodular components are similar dating back to ___. No new
  obvious focal opacity. CT would be more sensitive in the detection of subtle
  parenchymal changes given history of complex disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness. Assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs with
 persistent bilateral scattered areas of parenchymal opacities many of which
 have nodular components, similar to ___.  Chronic bronchiectasis
 is stable.
 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are otherwise unremarkable. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent multifocal parenchymal with nodular components are similar dating
 back to ___. No definite new focal opacity but subtle
 abnormalities would be difficult to detect within the setting of complex
 baseline abnormality. CT would be more sensitive and may be considered if
 warranted clinically.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 10:41 AM.
