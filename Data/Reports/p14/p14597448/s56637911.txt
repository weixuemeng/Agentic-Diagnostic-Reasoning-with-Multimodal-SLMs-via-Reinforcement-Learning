                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w h/o hypoplastic MDS/aplastic anemia s/p Allo
 now with nocardia infection in the lung  // please re-evaluate for infection
 etc.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pre-existing parenchymal opacity
 on the left has improved but bilateral scattered areas of parenchymal
 opacities, part of which have nodular components, are still clearly visible. 
 Mild overinflation.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.
