 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, patient with hypoplastic MDS.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Compared to several prior
 studies, chronic diffuse bilateral lung opacities worse in the periphery of
 the upper lobes, are also present in the lower lobes bilaterally, have
 minimally increased in the left lower lobe and in the left perihilar region. 
 As mentioned before, these opacities could be due to cryptogenic organizing
 pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
