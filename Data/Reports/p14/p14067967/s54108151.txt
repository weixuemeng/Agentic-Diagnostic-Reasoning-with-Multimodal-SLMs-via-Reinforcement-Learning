                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New Dobbhoff.
 
 TWO SEQUENTIAL AP VIEWS OF THE CHEST.  
 
 On view #1, the radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the upper/mid
 esophagus, and appears to be curled over on itself.  
 
 On view #2, the Dobbhoff has been advanced and now overlies the upper stomach.
 Relatively acute angulation at the junction between the radiolucent and
 radiopaque portions of the tube may still be present.  
 
 Compared with ___, Dobbhoff tube is new.  Direct comparison to the prior
 study is somewhat limited by exclusion of the lower right chest wall and right
 costophrenic angle.  Allowing for this, no gross change is detected. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, possibly very slightly worse at the left
 base.
