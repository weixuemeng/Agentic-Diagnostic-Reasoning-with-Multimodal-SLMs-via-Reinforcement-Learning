 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  Aortic knob calcifications are present.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
 is demonstrated with a probable trace left pleural effusion, although the

 pneumothorax is present.  Patchy atelectasis is again seen in the lung bases. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
