                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall from standing.  // ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no evidence for lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse coarsened interstitial markings are noted, and likely
 reflect underlying chronic lung disease.  The heart is mildly enlarged and
 there is minimal pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles likely reflects atelectasis versus scarring.  There is no displaced rib
 fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings of diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease without evidence of
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.  A non-urgent HRCT could be
 performed for further evaluation.
