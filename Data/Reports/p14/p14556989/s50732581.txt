                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Back pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky
 opacities in posterior lower lobes are more extensive on the left than right
 and most suggestive of atelectasis, although coinciding infection is not
 excluded. Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.  The bones are
 unremarkable. The vertebral body heights and interspaces appear preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities at both lung bases, although more suggestive of atelectasis than
 pneumonia. Correlation with clinical presentation is suggested.
