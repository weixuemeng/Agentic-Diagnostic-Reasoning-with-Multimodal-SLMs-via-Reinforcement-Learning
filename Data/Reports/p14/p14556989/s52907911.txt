                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F post intub, pls check ett placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   There has been interval intubation
 with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing approximately 3.5 cm above the
 carina. Since the prior exam, there is increasing bilateral atelectasis and
 ill-defined opacities within the lungs, left greater than right, raising
 concern for interval aspiration. A component of mild edema is difficult to
 exclude. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable though difficult to assess
 given technique. No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
 2. Increasing opacities in the lungs likely reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and possible aspiration. Difficult to exclude mild edema.
