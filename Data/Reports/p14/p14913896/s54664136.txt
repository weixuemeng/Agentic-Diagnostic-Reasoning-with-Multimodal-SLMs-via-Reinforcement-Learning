                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of Mycobacterium avium-
 intracellulare infection.  Now with increasing fatigue and shortness of
 breath, scant rales at bases, assess for any interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The moderate degree of heart size
 enlargement appears stable and no significant interval change can be
 identified.  Same holds for the moderately widened and elongated thoracic
 aorta with calcium deposits in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.  Mild
 degree of pulmonary congestive pattern in the form of perivascular haze
 appears unchanged.  No new evidence of pleural effusions as the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  Apparently chronic changes in the form
 of linear densities at the bases representing the known thickened walls of
 peribronchiectatic airways appear unchanged but may have increased slightly in
 the area of the lingula and the right middle lobe.  They assume the appearance
 similar to what was encountered on an older chest examination of ___. 
 No new discrete coherent areas of pneumonia can be seen.  No pneumothorax
 identified in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax again show a
 moderately accentuated kyphotic curvature and somewhat osteopenic vertebral
 body structures, but no new vertebral body fracture can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chest findings.  Mild increase of hazy densities
 in lingula, right middle lobe area similar to what patient had ___ years ago. 
 They may be sign of mild exacerbation of peribronchiectatic infiltrates.  No
 coherent new pneumonia can be identified.
