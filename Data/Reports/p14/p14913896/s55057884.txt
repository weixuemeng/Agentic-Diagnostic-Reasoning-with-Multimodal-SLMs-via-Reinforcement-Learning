                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  History: ___F with cough x 2 days  // eval pneumonia     
 eval pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is streaky density bilaterally most consistent with scarring or
 subsegmental atelectasis. Addition, there are ill-defined radiopacity is
 projected in the lower lungs, particularly adjacent to the right heart border,
 that probably represent bronchiectasis.  This assessment is difficult due to
 overlying costochondral cartilage.  There is no definite focal consolidation.
 The heart is normal in size. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. Mediastinal
 structures are stable. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute change. The lung findings as described likely represent
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring and bronchiectasis.  CTA may be helpful
 if further evaluation is clinically indicated.
