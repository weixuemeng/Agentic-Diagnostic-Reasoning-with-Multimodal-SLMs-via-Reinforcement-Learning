                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bronchiectasis, coarse breath
 sounds on physical examination bilaterally on the bases.  New fatigue and
 suspected atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright
 position are analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present.  The
 configuration suggests a prominence of the left ventricular contour but there
 is also some element of mild left atrial enlargement.  The pulmonary
 vasculature shows an upper zone re-distribution pattern, but no evidence of
 interstitial or alveolar edema.  Again on the lung bases, there is a coarse
 pattern compatible with thickened bronchial walls and bronchiectasis in the
 lower lobes.  These findings are rather unchanged in comparison with the next
 preceding study of ___.  They are consistent with findings on
 previous chest CT of ___ that identified rather advanced
 bronchiectases, most marked in the right lower lobe area.  In comparison with
 the next preceding chest examination of ___, there are no new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, is there any major atelectasis in the lung bases as
 clinically suspected.  Noteworthy is, however, a mild but detectable increase
 of the heart size, files include now a copied chest examination of ___
 marked ___ and apparently transferred in our files on ___.  Comparison suggests that at that time, the patient had superimposed
 parenchymal densities in the right lower lobe area more marked than it appears
 now or on our previous chest examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest finding compatible with chronic bilateral mostly
 basal bronchiectasis.  No acute new infiltrates seen.  Observed mild increase
 of heart size and upper zone re-distribution pattern in this elderly female
 patient.
