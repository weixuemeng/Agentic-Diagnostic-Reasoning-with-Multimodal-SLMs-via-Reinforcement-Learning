                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacities in the right middle and lower lobes appear not significantly changed
 since prior studies.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is perhaps
 hyperinflated to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent opacities in the right lower and middle lobes, but apparently
 chronic, suggesting atelectasis or chronic airway inflammation most likely.
