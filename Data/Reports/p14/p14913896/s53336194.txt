                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent fall who has dizziness, weakness and
 fatigue that are new onset after being cleared for the fall yesterday.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacities are most pronounced in the lung bases, and perhaps slightly
 progressed in the interval likely reflecting bronchiectasis with evidence of
 small airways infection, compatible with the patient's history of chronic MAC
 infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.  Mild degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy ill-defined bibasilar airspace opacities, perhaps slightly progressed
 in the interval, and compatible with the patient's known history of chronic
 MAC infection.
