                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable, with mild
 calcifications seen at the aortic knob.  Changes of bronchiectasis are seen
 bilaterally, with chronic interstitial changes very similar to the prior
 examination.  There is no evidence of new consolidative process or significant
 pulmonary edema.  Osseous structures appear grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia. Chronic changes are likely in large part due to
 bronchiectasis.
