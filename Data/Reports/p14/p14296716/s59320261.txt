                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chills, rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 There is no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Bronchial wall thickening in
 the lower lobes seen on the lateral view could be due to bronchitis.  There is
 no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size is normal.
