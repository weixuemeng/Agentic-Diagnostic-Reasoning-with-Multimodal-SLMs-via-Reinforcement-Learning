                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new dementing illness and odd
 movements, evaluate for any acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is seen, but there exists a relative prominence of the left
 ventricular contour.  This finding coincides with a general widening and
 elongation of the thoracic aorta suggests systemic hypertension.  There is,
 however, no conclusive evidence for any significant pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No evidence of acute infiltrates and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in apical area on frontal view. 
 Skeletal structures demonstrate moderate degree of degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine but no clear vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 When comparison is made to the frontal view of a previous chest examination of
 ___, the heart size has increased slightly and the thoracic
 aorta is more prominent as it was then.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elderly female patient with mild cardiac enlargement and
 generally widened thoracic aorta but no evidence of acute CHF and no acute
 infiltrates.
