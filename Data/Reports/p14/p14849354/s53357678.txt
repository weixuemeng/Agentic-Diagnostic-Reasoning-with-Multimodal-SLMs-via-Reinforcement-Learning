                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Comparison is also made with ___.  Compared to
 chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 
 Again, the pulmonary arteries appear dilated, which may be due to a component
 of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The hila are slightly prominent, again
 which may be related to pulmonary arterial hypertension and there may also be
 a component of vascular engorgement.  There appears to be mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  There is mild left basilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 is seen.  No focal consolidation is seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of enlarged pulmonary arteries is also seen on prior
 chest CT, suggests a component of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Interstitial edema.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
