                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left chest tenderness post-fall, history
 of breast cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Increased opacity is noted in the left lower lobe. 
 There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.   Prominence of the
 hilar contours suggests  central venous congestion and/or lymphadenopathy.  
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged, compatible with known pericardial
 effusion.  Unchanged saccular outpouching of the descending thoracic aorta.  
 
 No displaced fractures are identified.  Moderate degenerative changes in the
 imaged right acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or early infection.
 2.  Mild congestive heart failure.
 3.  Stable intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
 4.  No visible fractures.  If the patient has focal pain, dedicated rib series
 can be ordered.
