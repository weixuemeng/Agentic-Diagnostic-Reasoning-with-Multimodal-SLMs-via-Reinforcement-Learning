 HISTORY:  Followup left pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable view of the chest demonstrates some accumulation of a left pleural
 effusion compared to yesterday's chest radiograph.  There are low lung
 volumes, but the right lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  A left chest tube remains in the left
 lower lateral hemithorax.  A left IJ projects over the origin of the SVC.
   
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight re-accumulation of left pleural effusion compared to yesterday.
