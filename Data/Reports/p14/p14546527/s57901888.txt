                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:33 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, left IJ line placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___, performed elsewhere:
 
 A new left IJ line projects over the origin of the SVC.  There is no
 mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.  Very large left pleural effusion
 causing atelectasis of nearly the entire left lung, preceded the line
 placement, although it is larger than it was nine hours ago.  Right lung is
 essentially clear, aside from the expected degree of redirected blood flow. 
 Left heart border is obscured by the effusion and heart size is indeterminate.
