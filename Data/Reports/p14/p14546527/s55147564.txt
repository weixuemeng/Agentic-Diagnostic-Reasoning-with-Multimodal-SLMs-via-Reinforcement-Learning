 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:55 PM
  Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.  The small left
  apical pneumothorax appears decreased in size and nearly resolved.  Right
  basilar atelectasis is improved.  Unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette, with
  an expected post-operative appearance.  Linear lucencies overlying the chest
  wall and left shoulder suggest increasing subcutaneous air.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after CABG.  Evaluate effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 New subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall is most marked in the left axilla
 and supraclavicular region, where it was minimal on ___.  Lateral view
 shows air in the anterior mediastinum and retrosternal space as well. 
 Previous left pneumothorax is much smaller, while moderate left pleural
 effusion has increased.  Lateral view suggests retrosternal drainage devices
 are still present.
 
 There is no right pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion is stable.  The
 appearance of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable,
 and reflects mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly seen preoperatively.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Right jugular line ending in the low SVC is unchanged since
 ___.
 
 ___ was paged at 8:20 a.m., when the findings were recognized.
