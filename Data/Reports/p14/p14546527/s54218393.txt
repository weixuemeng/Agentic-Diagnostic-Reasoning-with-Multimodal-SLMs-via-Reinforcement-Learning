                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p renal transplant n/v  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  Midline sternotomy wires are
 intact and well aligned.  Persistent patchy and linear opacities in the lower
 lobes, most marked in the left retrocardiac region, also present on older
 radiographs dating back to ___.  Chronic blunting of left costophrenic angle
 favors pleural thickening over a small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia, but a subtle infection in the lung bases may be
 difficult to detect in the setting of chronic areas of scarring/atelectasis. 
 If there remains strong clinical suspicion for infection, short-term followup
 radiographs or CT may be considered if warranted clinically.  .
