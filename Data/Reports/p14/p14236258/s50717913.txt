                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension at dialysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual lumen subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates within
 the proximal right atrium, coursing through a vascular stent within the left
 brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 normal.  Mild rightward deviation of the trachea with left superior
 mediastinal mass compatible with a known thyroid goiter is unchanged. Hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis is noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Marked degenerative changes
 of the left glenohumeral joints and remote right posterior rib are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
