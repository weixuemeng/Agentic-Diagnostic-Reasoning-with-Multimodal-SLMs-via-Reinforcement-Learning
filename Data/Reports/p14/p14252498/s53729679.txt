                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.  The
 right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image, however, and no
 evidence of large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right costophrenic angle not fully included on the image.  Low
 lung volumes.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
