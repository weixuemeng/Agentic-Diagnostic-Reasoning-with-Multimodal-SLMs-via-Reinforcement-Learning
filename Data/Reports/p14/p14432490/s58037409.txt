                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, malaise, postop day 5 Caesarean
 section, +rhonchi throughout
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 03:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not substantially changed
 from the previous exam.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  No
 pulmonary edema is identified.  Ill-defined opacification within the left lung
 base remains similar to the previous study likely reflecting a combination of
 small pleural effusion and atelectasis though infection is not excluded. 
 Trace right pleural effusion is also likely present along with probable mild
 right basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued left basilar patchy opacity likely reflecting a combination of
 atelectasis and small left pleural effusion though infection is not excluded. 
 Small right pleural effusion with mild right basilar atelectasis also noted.
