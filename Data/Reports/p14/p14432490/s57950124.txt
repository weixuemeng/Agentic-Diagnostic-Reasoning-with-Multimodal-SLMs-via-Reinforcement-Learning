                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old G2P___ s/p C/S with 4-day history of URI, now with
 decreased O2 sats and crackles in lung bases  // rule out pneumonia     rule
 out pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 There is increased opacification at the left base with slight silhouetting of
 the hemidiaphragm on the lateral view.  This could well represent atelectatic
 changes and small pleural effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 history, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
