                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic
 contour is mildly prominent, but not significantly changed, perhaps reflecting
 slight ectasia along the arch or upper descending aorta.  The lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Similar slight prominence of the
 aortic arch contour, better evaluated on CT of the same day, but without
 change.
