                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of COPD, lung cancer status post
 CyberKnife, and hip replacement 6 weeks ago, presenting with dyspnea,
 leukocytosis, and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small right pleural effusion and a right lower lobe opacity. There
 is also concurrent mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  A fiducial marker is
 seen in the right upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion and mild interstitial pulmonary edema most
 consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure. However, given the
 strong clinical evidence for an infectious process, right lower lobe pneumonia
 must be suspected.
