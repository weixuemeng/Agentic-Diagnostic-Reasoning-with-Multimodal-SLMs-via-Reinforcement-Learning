 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___, the right basilar opacification has
 decreased and the hemidiaphragms are better seen. Although this could reflect
 improvement in the degree of pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, it
 also could merely be a manifestation of a more erect position of the patient.
 Similarly, there is less indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting some
 improvement in pulmonary vascular status.
