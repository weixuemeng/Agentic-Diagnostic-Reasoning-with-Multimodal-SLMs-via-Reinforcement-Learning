                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left subdural hemorrhage.
 
 CHEST, SUPINE AP:
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube lies 12 mm from the carinal angle and should
 be withdrawn to a better position.  Nasogastric tube is present in a good
 position.  Opacification of the left lower lobe is present, probably
 representing atelectasis rather than effusion.  Elsewhere, the lung fields are
 clear.
