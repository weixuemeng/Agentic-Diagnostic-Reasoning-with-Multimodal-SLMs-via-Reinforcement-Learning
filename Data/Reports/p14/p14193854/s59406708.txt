                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Fall downstairs.  Evaluate for a cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are extremely low, which
 cause accentuation of the mediastinum and crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Within this limitation, the heart is likely mildly enlarged.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube ends in the
 stomach.  Overlying clips from the patient's bra and EKG clips are noted.  A
 square radioopaque device obscure assessment of the medial right lung base. 
 Bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis; however,
 infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to extremely low lung volumes and radiopaque
 device projecting over the medial right lung base.  The ET tube ends 2 cm
 above the carina and should be slightly withdrawn.  Mild cardiomegaly. 
 Bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis; however,
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
