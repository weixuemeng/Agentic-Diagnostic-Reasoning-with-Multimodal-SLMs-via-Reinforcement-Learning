                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left subdural hematoma and probable hemothorax.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, the endotracheal tube is low, approximately 1.3 cm from the
 carina. An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach.  A left
 subclavian central venous catheter is present with the tip in the low SVC.
 
 The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  A retrocardiac opacity is
 likely due to atelectasis.  There is no new focal airspace opacity or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There may be a small left pleural
 effusion, which is unchanged.  There is no right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged low position of the endotracheal tube, 13 mm from the carina.
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and
 possibly a small left pleural effusion.
