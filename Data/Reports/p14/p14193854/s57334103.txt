                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate placement of the orogastric tube.  Tube feeds were
 started and now being suctioned out of the endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip and side
 ports in the expected location of the stomach.  An endotracheal tube is 2.3 cm
 from the carina.  A left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged with
 the tip in the upper SVC.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  An unchanged retrocardiac opacity is consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is no new opacity or pulmonary edema.  Mild vascular
 congestion has improved since the prior exam.  There is likely a tiny small
 left pleural effusion.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of the enteric tube.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:12 p.m. on ___ via telephone
