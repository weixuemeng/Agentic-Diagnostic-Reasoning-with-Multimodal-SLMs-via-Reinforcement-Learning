                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  COPD.  Evaluate nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Roughly ___-mm right suprahilar nodular opacity, visible only on the frontal
 view, is unchanged since ___.  I suspect this is a tortuous vessel. 
 Other smaller nodular opacities including nipple shadows are unchanged and
 there are no new lesions.  Heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is generally
 large, but not focally aneurysmal and not changed.  Healed multiple left-sided
 rib fractures.  Thoracic configuration suggests hyperinflation due to
 emphysema.  Mild loss of height in the lower thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged and there are no new thoracic spine abnormalities.
