                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left sided chest pain that is reproducible on
 exam and with arm motion.  // Chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is prominence of the hila likely due to central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement, possibly slightly improved as compared the prior study. 
 There is persistent blunting of the costophrenic angles, left greater than
 right although no large pleural effusion is seen.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple old left-sided rib deformities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Multiple old left-sided rib
 fractures.  No definite acute rib fracture seen, although study has limited
 sensitivity for the detection of such.  If high clinical concern for acute rib
 fracture, dedicated rib series or CT is more sensitive.
