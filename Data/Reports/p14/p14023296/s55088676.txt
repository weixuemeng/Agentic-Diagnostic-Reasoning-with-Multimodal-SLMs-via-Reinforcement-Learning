                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and prior CXRs dating back to
 ___, and prior chest CT and PET-FDG studies of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and has slightly increased
 compared to prior studies.  Enlarged central pulmonary vasculature appears
 stable compared to prior radiographs.  Known lung nodules in the superior
 segment of the right lower lobe and in the lingula are again demonstrated and
 appear similar to prior studies.  They were reportedly FDG negative on prior
 PET-CT of ___.  Minimal bibasilar scarring appears unchanged as
 well as multiple healed left rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Well-circumscribed lung nodules in the right lower lobe and lingula appear
 similar to prior radiographs since ___ and were not avid on prior
 PET-CT study. This is highly suggestive of a benign etiology such as a
 hamartoma or non-calcified granulomas.
