                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question right base opacity, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 As suspected on the previous AP CXR, there is patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region, suspicious for an infectious infiltrate.  On the lateral
 view, it is not entirely clear whether this lies in the middle or lower lobes.
 Allowing for low lung volumes, no CHF is identified. There is minimal
 atelectasis left base.  The heart is probably not enlarged, allowing for
 technique. Apparent coronary artery stent noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region, suspicious for
 infectious infiltrate.
