                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea, vomiting, recent hospitalization.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are slightly low lung volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Patchy right lung base opacity may represent confluence of overlapping
 structures, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting and could be better evaluated with dedicated PA
 and lateral views.  The left lung is clear.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta remains tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy right base opacity may represent
 overlapping structures, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would
 better evaluate.
