                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with metastatic RCC and recent left lower lobe
 pneumonia, to assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Previously seen left lower lobe pneumonia
 has improved.  Small scattered nodular opacities in the left lower lobe,
 consistent with known metastatic pulmonary nodules are stable.  There is mild
 increase in the left basal atelectasis/scarring and small left pleural
 effusion compared to the prior study. Left mediastinal contour abnormality,
 relates to the known prevascular adenopathy seen on prior CT.  Multiple intact
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips relate to prior CABG.  Small
 right pleural effusion is new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in the left lower lobe pneumonia.  Minimal increase
 in the small left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mediastinal adenopathy and left lower lobe pulmonary nodules, in keeping
 with the history of metastatic disease.
