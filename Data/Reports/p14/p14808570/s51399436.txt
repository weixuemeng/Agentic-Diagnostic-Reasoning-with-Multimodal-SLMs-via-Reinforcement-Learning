 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been very little change in the chest since ___ including a
 large multiloculated right pleural effusion, with a substantial fissural
 component.  Some right pleural effusion is dependent in the right posterior
 hemi thorax and could be layering.  Widening of the middle and anterior
 mediastinum due to adenopathy extending from the thoracic inlet to the level
 of the hila is also unchanged.  The only pleural drain identified is in the
 left hemithorax at the base of the lung.
