                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a suspected recurrent giant cell tumor of bone.
 Evaluate for pulmonary metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 A roughly 5 mm wide triangular opacity projecting over the left fourth rib
 anteriorly could be a lung nodule.  Other smaller opacities are attributable
 to vessel seen on end, but smaller lung nodules would be missed.  CT scanning
 would be definitive in excluding pulmonary metastases.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
