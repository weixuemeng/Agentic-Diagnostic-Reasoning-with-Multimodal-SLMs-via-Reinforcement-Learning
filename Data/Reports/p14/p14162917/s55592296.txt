                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenia and fever.  Rule out occult infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath access venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 mild tortuosity of the descending aorta.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Nodular opacity over the left lung could reflect the nipple shadow, however
 further evaluation is recommended with nipple markers. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacity over left lung projecting over nipple shadow,
 recommend repeat examination with nipple markers. Otherwise,  no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
