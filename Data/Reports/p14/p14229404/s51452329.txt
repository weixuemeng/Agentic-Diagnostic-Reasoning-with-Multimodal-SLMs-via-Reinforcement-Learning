                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M w alcohol abuse p/w a R displaced olecranon fx  // pre-op
 Surg: ___ (ORIF)
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size and the thoracic aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  Lung volumes are slightly increased with relative flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms suggesting the possibility of COPD.  Several well-marginated
 calcifications are present most notably in the periphery of the left upper
 hemithorax in along the left hemidiaphragm contours, suggestive of calcified
 pleural plaques.  Bilateral healed rib fractures are present and note is made
 of a asymmetric opacity at the right lung base adjacent to a site of a rib
 fracture.  It is uncertain whether this represents superimposition of healed
 fractures and adjacent scarring or potentially a discrete lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A focal air the opacity in right lung base is not fully localized on this
 portable chest radiograph.  Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs are
 recommended for initial further assessment of this finding.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:04 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
