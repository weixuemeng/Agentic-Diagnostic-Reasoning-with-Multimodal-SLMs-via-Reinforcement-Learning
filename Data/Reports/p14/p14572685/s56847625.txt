                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of metastatic melanoma, now with
 weakness and cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.  CT torso with
 contrast performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased opacification over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral radiograph may represent lower lobe atelectasis; however, a developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Horizontal
 linear opacities in the bilateral lung bases are consistent with plate-like
 atelectasis.  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is normal is size and
 unchanged.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous throughout its course.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable bibasilar atelectasis though in the appropriate clinical
 setting a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
