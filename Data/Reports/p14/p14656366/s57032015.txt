 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:22 PM
  Moderate cardiomegaly with left venticular configuration, new since ___, with
  interstitial abnormality suggesting mild congestion.  Interstitial
  opacification appears somewhat more confluent in the right lower lung than
  elsewhere, although probably part of the same process; short-term follow-up
  radiographs could be considered, however, to reassess.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart has substantially increased in size.  Although only
 mild-to-moderately enlarged, there is substantial suspected left ventricular
 hypertrophy or dilatation.  Otherwise, the mediastinal contours appear
 unchanged.  Mild interstitial prominence which suggests slight congestion
 including peribronchial cuffing.  The appearance includes a vaguely focal
 increased opacification projecting over the right lower lung, although of
 interstitial character.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.  Mild anterior
 wedging is noted along the mid thoracic vertebral body and several mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies show minimal loss in height, although not
 significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration, substantially
 increased since remote earlier radiographs.  
 
 2.  Mild diffuse interstitial abnormality, most suggestive of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  
 
 3.  Somewhat confluent interstitial opacification in the right lower lung,
 although not necessarily representing a separate process.  Followup
 radiographs are recommended in the short-term, however, preferably with PA and
 lateral technique if possible, to reassess.
