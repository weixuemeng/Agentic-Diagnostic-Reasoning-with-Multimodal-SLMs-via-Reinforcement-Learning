                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a vague patchy increased right
 infrahilar opacity, probably within the right lower lobe, although seen on
 only one view.  It is very similar to radiographs from ___ and is
 interstitial in character, although the more diffuse interstitial abnormality
 seems decreased since that time on more recent radiographs from ___ when the vague interstitial process in the right lower lobe was absent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Recurrent vague interstitial process in the right lower lobe
 which may reflect an unusual asymmetric pattern of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion noting the pattern of change and clinical context.
