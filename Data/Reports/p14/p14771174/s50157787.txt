                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two days nausea and vomiting with history of type A dissection
 repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views were reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable with a tortuous enlarged descending aorta, compatible with
 known aortic dissection status post repair.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is within normal limits.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with
 surgical clips overlying the mediastinum and right axilla. A left posterior
 rib defect is also likely post surgical. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
