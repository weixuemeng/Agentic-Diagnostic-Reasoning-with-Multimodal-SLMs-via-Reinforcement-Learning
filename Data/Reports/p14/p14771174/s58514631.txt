                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Patient with malaise and EKG changes.  History of repaired type A
 dissection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___ and CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Surgical clips project
 along the mediastinum and the right axillary region.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged as before.  The aorta is tortuous compared to the prior radiographs
 but similar to the appearance previously depicted on the scout view of the
 prior CT.  Left-sided rib deformities are probably also unchanged.  There is
 slight blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus, potentially a trace pleural
 effusion.  There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphgram.  The
 lungs appear clear.  Small osteophytes are similar along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post sternotomy with post-surgical changes.  Suspected
 trace left-sided pleural effusion.
