                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with substernal chest pain, rule out acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 The previously mentioned right upper lung nodular density is not as
 conspicuous on this study and may be obscured by oxygen tubing.  The heart
 size is top normal, and the mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  A mild
 amount of atherosclerosis is seen within a somewhat tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
