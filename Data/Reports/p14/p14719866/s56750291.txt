                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with mild to moderate cardiomegaly and
 a calcified tortuous aorta.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion,
 improved since the prior study.  Subtle patchy left base retrocardiac opacity
 most likely represents atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion, improved since
 the prior study.  Otherwise no significant interval change.  Persistent
 cardiomegaly.
