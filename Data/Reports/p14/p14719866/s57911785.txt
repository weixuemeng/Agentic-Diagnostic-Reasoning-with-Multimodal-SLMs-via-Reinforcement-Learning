                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The mediastinal silhouette is normal and
 unchanged since prior study.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  A calcified tortuous aorta is again noted.  A tiny nodular density
 is seen in the right upper lung which wasn't present on prior imaging.  While
 this may be a confluence of structures, it is not fully evaluated with this
 study.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular structure in right
 upper lung can be evaluated with oblique views or a non-emergent chest CT.
