                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged, but unchanged compared with prior exams.
 Sternotomy wires are intact.  Prosthetic valve noted.  Curvilinear structure
 overlying the anterior cardiac silhouette on lateral view could represent a
 calcified coronary artery.  Aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded.
 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution, similar prior, without other evidence
 of CHF.  Hilar contours are within normal limits.  Likely small hiatal hernia.
 
 There is increased opacity involving the left lower lobe on lateral view which
 likely represents atelectasis.  However, early infectious in filled should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, no focal
 infiltrates or consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated similar to prior.  No free air seen
 beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly, status post sternotomy.  Upper zone redistribution,
 without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Subtly increased opacity within the left lower lobe likely represents
 atelectasis.  However, infection should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No other focal infiltrates and no frank consolidation.
 
 Small hiatal hernia noted.
