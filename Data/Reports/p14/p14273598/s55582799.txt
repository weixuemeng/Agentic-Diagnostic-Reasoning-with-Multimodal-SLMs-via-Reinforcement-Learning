                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate new bilateral central opacification suggesting new onset of
 pulmonary edema over the short interval.  Pleural effusions are not well
 demonstrated on this study but are likely to persist as subpulmonic effusions.
 Developing pneumonia, particularly at the medial right lung base, is not
 excluded, although findings can likely be explain by pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with new pulmonary edema.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs are suggested in order to exclude the possibility of coinciding
 development of pneumonia.
