                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man sched for fem pop bypass (Right lower extremity) 
 // pre op EKG Surg: ___ (fempop bypass)     pre op EKG
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial abnormality most commonly edema, but there is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, cardiomegaly, or pleural effusion.  This could
 be disseminated carcinoma, particularly since mediastinum is widened in the
 right paratracheal station could be due to adenopathy as an alternative to
 venous engorgement.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If interstitial abnormality does not resolve with
 diuresis, chest CT should be performed to look for another explanation.
