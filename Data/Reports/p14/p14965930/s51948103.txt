                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for chest lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggesting some chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  
 
 There is prominence of the ascending aorta.  This raises the possibility of
 hypertension.
