                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheal stenosis  // R/O PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam is somewhat limited due to extremely low lung volumes accentuating the
 cardiomediastinal contours and resulting in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  Known tracheal stenosis is seen to better detail on prior CT.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are suggestive of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
