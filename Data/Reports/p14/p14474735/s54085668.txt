                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheal resection, here to evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Linear opacification of the right mid lung likely reflects fluid within the
 fissure or plate-like atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes but otherwise within normal limits and
 unchanged.  A lucency projecting over the left upper mediastinum on the
 frontal view is concerning for a new focus of air but not corroborated on the
 lateral view.  A repeat study is recommended. The hilar contours are stable
 and within normal limits.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New lucency over the left upper mediastinum on frontal view only. A repeat
 chest radiograph is recommended to confirm this finding.
 2.  Low lung volumes.
 
 Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ surgery via telephone at
 12:15pm on ___.  The patient is clinically stable at this time.
