                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after cervical tracheal
 resection and reconstruction.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  There is a surgical drain
 projecting over the upper mediastinum, most likely related to the recent
 surgery.  Mild interstitial edema cannot be excluded as well as bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar areas of
 atelectasis are noted.
