 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // ?tube placement      ?tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. Minimally displaced rib
 fractures are seen in the posterior aspect of the  right eighth, ninth and
 tenth ribs. Cortical irregularity at the most lateral aspect of the right
 ninth rib, noted at the edge of the film, could also reflect an additional
 minimally displaced fracture. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Minimal linear atelectasis is seen at the left lung
 base.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. No significant
 pneumothorax identified on this supine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina, in
 adequate position.
 2. Minimally displaced fractures of the right eighth, ninth and tenth ribs, no
 pneumothorax detected on this supine radiograph.
