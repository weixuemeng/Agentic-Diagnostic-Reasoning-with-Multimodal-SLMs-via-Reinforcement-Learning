                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes.  However,
 there are bibasilar opacities, likely representing a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusions.  Additionally, there are bilateral
 interstitial opacities raising suspicions for mild pulmonary edema.  The
 visualized portions of the upper cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. 
 Lower cardiomediastinal silhouette is severely limited on evaluation.  There
 is a lucent focus adjacent to the lower right heart border which may be
 suggestive of a herniated loop of bowel. Severe kyphosis of the thoracic spine
 is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Limited study due to patient positioning and low lung volumes demonstrate
 evidence of mild pulmonary edema as well as bibasilar opacities suggestive of
 atelectasis and pleural effusions.  Pneumonia must be excluded in the proper
 clinical setting.
 2. Lucent focus adjacent to the right heart border may be representative of a
 herniated loop of bowel.
