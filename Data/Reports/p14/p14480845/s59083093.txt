                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with two weeks of cough, wheeze, suspected
 pneumonia on outside chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The previously
 seen left lower lung opacity is again demonstrated on the study.  There is a
 focal consolidation in the lower segment of the lingular lobe of the left
 lung, better defined on the lateral view.  The right lung is clear.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Focal consolidation of the lower segment of the lingular lobe of
 the left lung.  This is consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ ___ page by Dr. ___ at
