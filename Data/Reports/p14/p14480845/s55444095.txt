                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac
 silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size.  There is mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raising the possibility of some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  No evidence of pleural effusion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
