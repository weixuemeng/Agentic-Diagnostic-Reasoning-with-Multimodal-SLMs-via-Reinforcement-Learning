                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal portable views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is similar to prior, although exaggerated by low lung volumes. 
 Lungs are clear without focal or diffuse abnormality.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may represent an effusion although assessment is limited by
 soft tissue attenuation.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  Possible right pleural effusion, although
 assessment is limited.  PA and lateral views with better inspiration could be
 obtained for further evaluation.
