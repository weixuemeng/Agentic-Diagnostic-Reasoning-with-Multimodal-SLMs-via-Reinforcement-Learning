                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with large right stroke and sleed apnea  //
 decomopensated respiratory status, wheezing ? aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 NG tube in situ coursing out of sight inferiorly.  Mild interval increase in
 transverse cardiac diameter.  Mild cephalization of pulmonary blood vessels. 
 Mild airspace opacification seen in the lower lung zones most likely represent
 atelectasis, but may represent aspiration or new developing pneumonia.
 No large associated effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in cardiac diameter with mild pulmonary venous congestion
 suggest fluid overload or cardiac decompensation.
 
 Mild new airspace opacification seen in the lung bases which most likely
 represents atelectasis, but aspiration and early infection cannot be excluded.
 Short-term interval follow-up imaging advised.
