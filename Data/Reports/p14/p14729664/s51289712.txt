                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute hypoxia.  // ?pulmonary edema vs.
 pneumonia      ?pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Previous heterogeneously distributed pulmonary consolidation that appeared
 on ___, has grown more intense in the areas of greatest involvement,
 right suprahilar and left perihilar lung and there is new abnormality today at
 the left lung base.  In the absence of cardiomegaly, even though there is a
 small to moderate volume of persistent pleural fluid, right greater than left,
 it is not entirely clear this is pulmonary edema.  Multi focal atypical
 pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage are reasonable alternatives.  There are new
 areas of subpleural opacity at the left apex as well as the right lung base.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.
