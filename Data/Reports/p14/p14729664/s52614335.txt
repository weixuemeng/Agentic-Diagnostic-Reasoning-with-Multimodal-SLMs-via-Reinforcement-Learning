                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea  // Acute cardiopulm disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction in
 appropriate position.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart
 is normal in size. Diffuse interstitial opacities are most consistent with
 mild to moderate pulmonary edema as well as moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Slightly more focal opacity involving the right upper lung may be
 related to focal edema as a result of mitral regurgitation. No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities are most consistent with pulmonary edema,
 however an atypical pneumonia with interstitial, consolidative components
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.
