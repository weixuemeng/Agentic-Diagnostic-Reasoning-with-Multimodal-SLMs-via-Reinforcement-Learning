  1.  Low lung volumes with left basilar opacity which could be atelectasis
  noting that infection cannot be excluded.
  2. Persistent free intraperitoneal air. Although significantly decreased in
  amount since prior CT scan given differences in technique, this is somewhat
  unexpected this far out from intervention from several weeks prior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of glioblastoma resection present with "seizure like
 activity" described as rigors  // CXR: eval for consolidationCT head: eval for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings and a retrocardiac opacity which is likely
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Free
 intraperitoneal air is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with left basilar opacity which could be atelectasis
 noting that infection cannot be excluded.
 2. Persistent free intraperitoneal air.  Although significantly decreased in
 amount since prior CT scan given differences in technique, this is somewhat
 unexpected this far out from intervention from several weeks prior.
