                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  Right pneumothorax status post chest tube and line placement.
 Evaluation for line and tube positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day at 17:12.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right
 atrium. The tip of the chest tube is situated at the apex. There is post
 residual subcutaneous emphysema. The endotracheal tube is appropriately
 positioned at 4.2 cm above the carina. Known large right pneumothorax is
 difficult to appreciate on this exam. The left chest is clear although the
 left lung apex is not included in the field of view. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion.
 Included upper abdomen is notable for excreted contrast in the kidneys.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right
 atrium.
 
 2.  Status post right chest tube placement was subcutaneous emphysema. Known
 large right pneumothorax is not clearly appreciated on this exam.
