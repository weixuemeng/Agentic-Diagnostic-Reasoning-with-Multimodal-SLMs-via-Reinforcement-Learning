                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 12:23
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nodular density in the right infrahilar
 region on chest film ___, followup chest film.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's outside study of ___ and ___
 ___ ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 12:23 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The more
 recently identified right mid lung nodular opacity persists and although this
 could reflect confluence of vascular structures, a pulmonary nodule cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Therefore, further imaging evaluation with chest CT to
 exclude an underlying mass should be considered.  No pleural effusions and no
 pulmonary edema.  No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  A more rounded appearance to the
 left mid lung in the suprahilar region is stable since ___ and therefore is
 consistent with a benign process.  Results of this examination were entered
 into the radiology critical results dashboard on ___ at 1:25 p.m.
