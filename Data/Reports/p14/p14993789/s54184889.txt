                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with head bleed, intubated, evaluate for tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina.  NG tube is
 within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  Band-like opacity at the left base
 likely represents atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, large
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely
 accentuated by the portable technique, patient positioning, and low lung
 volumes. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina, consider pulling back
 by 1-2 cm for optimal positioning.
 2.  Low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis.
