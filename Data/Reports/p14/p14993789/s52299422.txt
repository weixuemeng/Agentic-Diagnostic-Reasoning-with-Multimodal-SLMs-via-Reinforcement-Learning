                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachypnea, assess for volume overload versus pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable view of the chest demonstrates stable cardiomegaly accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion with minimal pulmonary edema.  The subtle
 opacity seen in the right infrahilar region on yesterday's radiograph is no
 longer present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  An NGT enters
 the stomach. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right infrahilar opacity is no longer present and therefore likely represented
 edema rather than pneumonia. Otherwise, no significant interval change.
