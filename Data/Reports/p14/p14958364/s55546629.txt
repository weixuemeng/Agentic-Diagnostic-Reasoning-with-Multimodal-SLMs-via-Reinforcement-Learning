 AP CHEST, 5:37 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with hypoxia and multifocal pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema after diuresis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are much smaller today, exaggerating parenchymal abnormality. 
 There has been some clearing in both lungs, but large areas of consolidation
 remain predominantly at the right apex and right base, most likely pneumonia. 
 Heart is only mildly enlarged, mediastinal veins borderline dilated.  Pleural
 effusions are presumed but not substantial.
