                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with trauma recently and hemothorax/ pneumothorax
 status post chest tube in past 3 weeks, traveled from ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ from outside institution, chest
 radiograph ___ from outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the arch.  No pulmonary edema is
 present.  A small right pleural effusion which is partially loculated in the
 minor fissure appears decreased in size compared to the previous radiograph. 
 Trace left pleural effusion also has decreased from the prior radiograph. 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects compressive atelectasis
 and appears improved.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small right pleural effusion, partially loculated in the minor fissure,
 decreased from the previous chest radiograph.  Improving right basilar
 compressive atelectasis.
 2. Decreased size of trace left pleural effusion.
