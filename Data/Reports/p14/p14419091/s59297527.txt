                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man , loculated pleural effusion  // s/p unsuccessful
 Chest tube r/o R sided PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 22.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is curvilinear density over the left upper lobe laterally, new compared
 with ___, which raises the question of a small pneumothorax. 
 However, the appearance is somewhat atypical and no correlative finding is
 identified on the ___ chest CT.  The differential could include
 artifact due to a skin fold.  No obvious right apical pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 Possible mild interval increase in upper zone redistribution.  Otherwise,
 allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal and pleural
 slight parenchymal findings are overall similar.
 
 Incidental note is made of marked narrowing of the right rotator cuff
 interval, consists with chronic rotator cuff tear and severe glenohumeral
 osteoarthritis bilaterally .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Curvilinear density at the left upper lobe, equivocal for a small
 pneumothorax.  The differential could include a skin fold.  Clinical
 correlation and attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 2. No right-sided pneumothorax identified.
 3. Possible slight increase in the degree of upper zone redistribution. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
