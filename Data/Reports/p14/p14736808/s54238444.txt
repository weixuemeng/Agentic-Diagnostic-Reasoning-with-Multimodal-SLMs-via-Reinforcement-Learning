                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours suggest very mild central adenopathy involving both hila, right lower
 paratracheal and aortopulmonic region of the mediastinum. Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Perihilar vessels are slightly
 prominent.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild central adenopathy could be reactive to infection, or, if chronic,
 sarcoidosis or other condition.  If not documented as stable by comparison
 with any prior chest imaging, followup chest radiographs or CT scanning is
 indicated.
