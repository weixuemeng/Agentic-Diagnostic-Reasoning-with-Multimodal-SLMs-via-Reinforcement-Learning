                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:11 A.M. ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after a colonoscopic polypectomy, now with rigors
 and increasing abdominal pain.  Rule out perforation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiograph. 
 Examination is marked upright.  No free gas is seen below the diaphragm. 
 Heart is mildly enlarged and the pulmonary vasculature engorged, but low lung
 volumes makes it hard to say whether mild interstitial edema has developed. 
 Pleural effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.
