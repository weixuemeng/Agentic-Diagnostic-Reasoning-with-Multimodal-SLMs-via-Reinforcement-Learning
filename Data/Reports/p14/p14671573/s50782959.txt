                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, dyspnea, vomiting with upper GI bleeding.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcification of the
 thoracic aorta noted.  The hilar contours remain enlarged, with perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema,
 findings which appear slightly progressed when compared to the radiograph
 obtained earlier the same day.  More focal opacity within the peripheral
 aspect of the left lung base appears more pronounced compared to the prior
 exam, and infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  There is no free subdiaphragmatic air. 
 Multiple clips are seen along the left lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, progressed when compared to the radiograph obtained
 earlier the same day.  More focal opacity within the periphery of the left
 lung base also appears more pronounced than on the prior study, and is
 non-specific, but could reflect an area of infection or aspiration.  Follow up
 radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
