 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a left-sided chest tube.  The left pleural effusion has almost completely
 resolved.  There is a minimal left apical pneumothorax.  On the right, the
 pleural effusion has minimally increased, but is still restricted at right
 lung bases and to the area of the costophrenic sinus.  No evidence of tension.
 The well-inflated areas of the lungs are unremarkable.
