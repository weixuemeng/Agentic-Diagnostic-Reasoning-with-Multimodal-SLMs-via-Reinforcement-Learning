                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracoscopy, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are stable.  The left-sided pigtail catheter has been removed. Two chest
 tubes have been placed in the left hemithorax.  
 
 There is a persistent left basilar pneumothorax; however, it is decrease in
 size. Adjacent left lower lobe opacity either representing atelectasis or
 pneumonia is unchanged.  Diffuse interstitial opacities are again seen, which
 could represent a combination of interstitial pulmonary edema or possibly
 atypical pneumonia.  No right-sided pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in left basilar pneumothorax and left pleural
 effusion.  Mild interstitial opacities may indicate mild pulmonary edema
 versus atypical infection. Persistent left lower lobe opacity either
 representing atelectasis or pneumonia is unchanged.
