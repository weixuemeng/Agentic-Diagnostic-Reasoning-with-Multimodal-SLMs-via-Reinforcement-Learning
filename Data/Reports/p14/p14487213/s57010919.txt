                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large partially loculated left pleural effusion is new.  This
 partially obscures the left heart border.  Allowing for this limitation, there
 has been apparent increase in size of the heart, accompanied by upper zone
 vascular redistribution and bilateral interstitial opacities.  Focal
 atelectasis is present in the left mid and lower lung regions adjacent to the
 loculated left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New large loculated left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 Empyema should be considered in the absence of recent trauma or intervention. 
 Coexisting pneumonia in this region is not excluded radiographically.
 
 2.  New bilateral interstitial opacities likely represent interstitial edema
 in the setting of end-stage renal disease and less likely an atypical
 pneumonia.  
 
 Dr. ___ has been paged to discuss these findings at 4:25 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
