                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Followup of empyema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pigtail drainage catheter has been placed into the left lower
 hemithorax since the prior examination with marked reduction in a loculated
 left-sided pleural effusion.  However, there is considerable persistent
 opacification along the pleural surfaces of the left mid to lower lung as well
 asretrocardiac opacification.  Associated with the presence of the catheter,
 there is now a small amount of air associated with the collection.  Moderate
 interstitial abnormality appears increased in severity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post placement of pleural drain on the left with
 substantial decrease in loculated pleural effusion.  Increasing interstitial
 abnormality for which differential considerations include interstitial
 pulmonary edema or perhaps less likely atypical pneumonia.
