                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ years old man with tracheomalacia, new pulmonary infiltrates. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared with ___.
 
 Right lung is reduced in volume compared to the left lung for complete
 consolidation/atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes, which appears
 more dense compared to prior exam with increasing volume loss.  
 
 Streaky opacities probably in the left mid lung, probably in the lingula, are
 similar and suggest minor atelectasis.  
 
 A pleural effusion is suspected on the right but difficult to quantify; for
 the most part opacification is likely parenchmal.  There is no pleural
 effusion on the left.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Increasing dense opacification and volume loss involving the right middle and
 lower lobes, suggesting worsening extensive atelectasis - infectious etiology
 is not excluded; a coinciding pleural effusion is suspected on the right but
 difficult to quantify.
