                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion
 and interstitial edema.  As compared to previous radiographs of ___ and
 ___, the extent of pulmonary edema has improved, and pleural
 effusions have decreased in size, with residual small effusions remaining. 
 Although most of the pre-existing alveolar opacities have cleared since the
 prior ___ radiograph, a mass-like area of consolidation measuring
 3.4 x 2.6 cm in the right upper lobe has only partially improved, previously
 measuring 4.2 x 3.9 cm in diameter.  As this is a new finding compared to
 ___, it is not concerning for malignancy, but it could potentially
 represent an area of infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving pulmonary edema with residual predominantly interstitial edema
 remaining, and decreasing pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Focal mass-like opacity in right upper lobe has slightly decreased in size
 since ___.  Differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical edema
 versus focal infectious pneumonia.
