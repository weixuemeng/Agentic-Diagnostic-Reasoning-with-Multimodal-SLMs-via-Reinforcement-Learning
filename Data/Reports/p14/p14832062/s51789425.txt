                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pulmonary edema, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate interstitial edema has worsened and is now moderate to severe.  There
 is one focal area more confluent in right upper lobe.  It could still be
 asymmetric edema, but close followup to this area is suggested to rule out
 developing pneumonia.  Bilateral small pleural effusions with atelectasis have
 either worsened or are new.  Cardiac contour is moderately enlarged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Worsening of moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
 2.  Right upper lobe confluent opacification could still represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema; however, close attention to this area in followup is
 suggested to rule out developing pneumonia.
