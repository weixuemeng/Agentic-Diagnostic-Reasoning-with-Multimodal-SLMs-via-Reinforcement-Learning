                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Renal insufficiency, shortness of breath, hyponatremia and worsening
 renal failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline enlarged.  Allowing for technique, the
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is a moderate
 interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary edema with small suspected
 pleural effusions, better suggested on the lateral view.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Superimposed are streaky opacities in the left mid lung,
 possibly coinciding atelectasis.  Fissures are mildly thickened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with a mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
