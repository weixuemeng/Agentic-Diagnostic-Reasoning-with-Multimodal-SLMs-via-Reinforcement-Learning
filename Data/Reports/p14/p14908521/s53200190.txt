                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with seizure  // PNA, bleed
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.   Known right upper lobe
 lesion is not clearly visualized. Overlying EKG leads are present. There is no
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Sclerotic appearance of several vertebral bodies on the
 lateral projection is compatible with known metastatic disease. A compression
 deformity involving the mid thoracic spine is better assessed on prior CT
 chest.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process. Known upper lobe lesion poorly visualized.
 Sclerotic osseous metastases better assessed on prior CT.
