                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC  // Traumatic injury?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying terminating approximately 1.8 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube tip is within the stomach however the side port
 appears to be at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be
 advanced slightly for optimal positioning.  Low lung volumes are present. 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged, but exaggerated by the presence of low
 lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with the
 widening of the superior mediastinum accounted for by the low lung volumes and
 supine positioning.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without
 overt pulmonary edema.  There is minimal atelectasis in the lung bases, but no
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this
 supine exam.  Irregularity of the left seventh lateral rib cortex suggests a
 nondisplaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube.  Recommend retraction by approximately 2 cm.
 2. Enteric tube tip within the stomach, but side port at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Recommend slight interval advancement for optimal
 positioning.
 3. Nondisplaced left seventh lateral rib fracture.
