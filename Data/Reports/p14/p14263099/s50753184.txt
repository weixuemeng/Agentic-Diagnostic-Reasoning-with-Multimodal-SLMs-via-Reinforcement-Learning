                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ough/fever  // r/p pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are again seen.
 
 As compared with multiple prior exams, there is persistent though resolving
 left basal opacity which likely represents a combination of atelectasis,
 pleural thickening and probable small effusion. In this patient status post
 recent CABG, findings are likely related to postoperative change. No new
 opacity is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but resolving left basal opacity likely representing a combination
 of atelectasis, pleural thickening and possible small residual effusion.
