                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG with tubes clamped.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, with the tubes clamped, there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  The atelectatic streaks at the right base have
 essentially cleared.  Opacification at the left base is again consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and some pleural fluid.
 
 In the interval, the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube have been removed.
