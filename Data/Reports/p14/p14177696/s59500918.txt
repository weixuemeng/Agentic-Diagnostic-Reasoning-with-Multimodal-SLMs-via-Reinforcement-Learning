                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT.  NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP chest portable radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Barium enema from ___, KUB from ___, CT
 abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy, with anastomosis
 likely at the level of the diaphragm on review of the prior CT.  The lungs are
 mostly clear.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinum and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema,
 pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The tip of the
 nasogastric tube is difficult to ascertain, and possibly terminates in the
 lower chest or below the diaphragm.  Dense radiopaque material in the shape of
 bowel loops is seen in the left upper quadrant and midline, likely from prior
 barium enema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube can be traced to the lower esophagus but the tip is
 indistinct and cannot be localized.  Repeat imaging with conventional
 radiograph for further evaluation is recommended prior to use.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat imaging with conventional radiograph for further
 evaluation is recommended prior to use.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 9:47 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of
