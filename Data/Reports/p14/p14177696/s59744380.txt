 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard positioning, terminating approximately 4 cm
 from the carina.  An enteric tube tip terminates in the distal esophagus, with
 side port in the mid esophagus and should be advanced by at least 15 cm for
 appropriate positioning.  Remainder of the examination is unchanged.  No
