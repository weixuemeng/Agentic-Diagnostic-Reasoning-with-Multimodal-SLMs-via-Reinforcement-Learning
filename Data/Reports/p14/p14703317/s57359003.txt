                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ARF, AMS  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle and there could be a trace pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar to the prior study.  Slight
 prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggest pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, nonspecific, but could be due
 to a small pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation.
