  Single portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates stable cardiomediastinal
  and hilar contours.  Lung volumes are low.  There is no focal opacity
  convincing for pneumonia.  Mild vascular congestion is present.  There is no
  over pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive
  of spot small pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
