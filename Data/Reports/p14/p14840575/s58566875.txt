                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is moderate-to-marked compression of at least one vertebral body in the
 mid to lower thoracic region and possible two thoracic vertebral bodies, of
 indeterminate age, given lack of priors for comparison.  Recommend clinical
 correlation for acuity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Compression of at least one and possibly two mid-to-lower thoracic
 vertebral bodies, of indeterminate age.  Recommend clinical correlation for
 acuity.
