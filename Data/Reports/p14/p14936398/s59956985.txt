                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible empyema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacities overlying the entire right hemithorax are not
 substantially changed, again consistent with combination of effusion and
 consolidation. Mild deviation of the mediastinum to the right suggests
 atelectasis as well.  Parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe are also
 concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiac size is grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Little overall change in extensive right sided pneumonia and
 pleural effusion and probable left sided pneumonia.
