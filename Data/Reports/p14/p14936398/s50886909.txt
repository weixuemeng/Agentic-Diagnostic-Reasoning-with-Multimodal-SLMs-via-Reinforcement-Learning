                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of quadriplegia and recurrent pneumonia, now status post
 bronchoscopy, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 16:08.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  Cervical spinal
 fixation hardware is noted.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated
 due to bibasilar opacification.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits and stable.  There is persistent diffuse opacification of the
 right mid and lower lung zones greater than the left lower lung zone.  There
 is silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border.  These
 findings likely reflect a combination of large pleural effusion and underlying
 consolidation or atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also
 noted.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Large bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left with
 underlying consolidation or atelectasis.
