                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued diffuse
 opacification on the right and probably slightly more opacification on the
 left.  The findings reflect some combination of large pleural effusions,
 vascular congestion, atelectasis, and possible superimposed pneumonia. 
 Tracheostomy remains in place.
