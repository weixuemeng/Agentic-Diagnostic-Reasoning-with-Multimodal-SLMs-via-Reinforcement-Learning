                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Subclavian line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained less than one hour earlier.
 
 The portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent right
 hemidiaphragm elevation, most likely reflecting paralysis.  The left
 subclavian line tip is at the left brachiocephalic vein.  No apparent interval
 development of pneumothorax is seen.
