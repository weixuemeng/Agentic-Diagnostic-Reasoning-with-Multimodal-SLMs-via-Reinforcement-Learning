                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:51 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 2:28 p.m.:
 
 Severe consolidation in the right lung and moderate to large right pleural
 effusion have both increased.  There may also be a component of volume loss
 which points to bronchial occlusion in the right lung, presumably retained
 secretions.  Very mild heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower
 lung zone is suggestive of additional areas of pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.  Left subclavian line
 ends just proximal to the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  I discussed the
 findings by telephone with Dr. ___ at 10 o'clock when the findings
 were recognized.
