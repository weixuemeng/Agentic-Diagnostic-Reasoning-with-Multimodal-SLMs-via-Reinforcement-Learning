                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient who is tracheostomy dependent, now
 hypoxic and making excess secretions, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Unchanged position of tracheostomy cannula.  No
 pneumothorax has developed.  Previously identified extensive scattered
 parenchymal patchy infiltrates persist.  They have not changed significantly
 in appearance.  On the left side, there are no new similar infiltrates on the
 left lung base, which did not exist on the previous examination. 
 Simultaneously, there developed also some pleural effusion, which is blunting
 the left lateral pleural sinus.  No infiltrates in the mid and upper lung
 fields and no pneumothorax on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rather stable extensive pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in
 right hemithorax.  New infiltrate coinciding with some pleural effusion on the
 left lung base.  These radiographic findings match the clinically suggested
 findings of a pneumonic infiltrate.  Followup examination is recommended. 
 Referring physician, ___, paged at 2:50 p.m.
