 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no radiographic evidence of pneumothorax following recent
 line attempt.  Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position, with possible
 overdistention of the cuff.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Heterogeneous opacities are again demonstrated in the right lung, with slight
 worsening in the right upper lobe but slight improvement in the right lower
 lobe.  Layering right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Minimal left basilar
 atelectasis has improved.
