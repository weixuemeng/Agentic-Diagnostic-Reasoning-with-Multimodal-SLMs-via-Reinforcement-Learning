                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fall.  OG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in
 the stomach.  The left subclavian line tip is at the level of left
 brachiocephalic vein, mid portion.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are substantially hyperinflated.  Bibasal opacities are
 noted and might reflect areas of atelectasis, right more than left.  Small
 amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded bilaterally.
