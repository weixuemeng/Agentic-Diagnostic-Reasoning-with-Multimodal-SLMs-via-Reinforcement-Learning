                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient for pneumothorax, with
 history of trauma and cervical spine injury.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to the prior study obtained the same day at 02:29 a.m., there is
 additional interval elevation of the right hemidiaphragm that most likely
 associated with progressing diaphragmatic paralysis due to known cervical
 spine injury.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated on the current
 examination.  Mediastinal contour is stable.  The ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above
 the carina.
