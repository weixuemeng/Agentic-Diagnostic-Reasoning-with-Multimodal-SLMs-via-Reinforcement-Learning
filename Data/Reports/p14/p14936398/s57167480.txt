                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 4:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with trach placement, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:46.
 
 Portable supine chest from ___ at 4:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  There is increasing
 opacification in the right hemithorax which likely reflects a combination of
 increasing pleural fluid and either lobar collapse from mucous plugging or
 evolving pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised.  In addition, there are
 patchy opacities in the left mid and lower lung which could reflect
 atelectasis or pneumonia, although these are not significantly changed.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the current study.
