 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 prominence of interstitial markings that could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure. Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease, though no definite acute pneumonia is appreciated. There is
 extensive calcification in the aorta, both the ascending portion and arch.
 Left basilar opacification is concerning for volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.
