                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ukraninan man with positive screening PPD (15 mm).  No active TB
 history or symptoms.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodules are detected.  No
 apical scarring, hilar retraction, or calcified nodes identified. Slight
 tenting of the left hemidiaphragm could reflect subtle scarring, but no gross
 focal parenchymal scarring is detected. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion
 is identified.  
 
 Osseous structures are within normal limits, allowing for possible minimal
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
   
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm without overt parenchymal scarring. 
 Otherwise, CXR examination within normal limits. No radiographic findings
 typical for pulmonary tuberculosis.
