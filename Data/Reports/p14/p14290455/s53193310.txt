                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 13:14 and CT torso ___ at 14 25.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 appearing mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Known air collection within the right anterior pleural
 space likely reflective of a pneumothorax is not well seen on the current
 exam.  The remainder of the lungs appear unchanged.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  Contrast from the recent CT is noted within the collecting systems.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No interval change from the previous radiograph performed approximately 1 hour
 earlier.
