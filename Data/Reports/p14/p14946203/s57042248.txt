                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:42
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with crackles on the right lower and lung
 despite diuresis, concern for developing infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable upper chest film on ___, 11:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular sheath unchanged in position.  A left-sided
 pacemaker also unchanged.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG.  The heart
 continues to be enlarged and has a globular configuration which could reflect
 cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 There is a persistent but improved vascular congestion.  There is persistent
 retrocardiac opacity which may reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  There are likely small effusions.  In addition,
 there is an apparent right upper lobe asymmetry which may represent residual
 pulmonary edema, although an evolving infectious process in this area cannot
 be excluded.  Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be
 performed as clinically indicated.  No pneumothorax.
