                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 most likely chronic interstitial changes essentially with no new
 consolidations to suggest infectious process.  Mucosa projecting over the lung
 bases bilaterally.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Replaced
 humerus on the right is noted.
