                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain  // eval for non-cardiac causes
 of chest pain      eval for non-cardiac causes of chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is still substantial volume loss and perihilar consolidation in the
 right upper lobe.  In combination with the enlarged right hilus, this finding
 is concerning for continued bronchial obstruction, perhaps malignant, perhaps
 due to poor clearance of secretions, perhaps reactive adenopathy.  .  Right
 lower lobe atelectasis is less pronounced, but has not cleared.  Small right
 pleural effusion is present.  Heart size top-normal.  Fullness in the right
 lower paratracheal station of the mediastinum could be due to adenopathy.
 
 Left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural abnormality.
 
 Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
