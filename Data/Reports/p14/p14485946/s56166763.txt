                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT chest ___ from outside
 institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  A right subclavian central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged.  Patient has been
 extubated.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Widened mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent consolidative opacity in
 the right upper lobe likely reflects continued pneumonia.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are likely present.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Degenerative changes
 are noted in the right acromioclavicular joint as well as within the imaged
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe likely reflects
 continued pneumonia.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, though additional sites of infection cannot be excluded. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
