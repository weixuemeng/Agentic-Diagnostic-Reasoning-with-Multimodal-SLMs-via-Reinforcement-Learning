                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with sepsis.  Evaluate position of OG
 tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is low, 2 cm above the carina.  This
 could be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement.  There is a
 nasogastric tube whose distal tip is poorly seen due to technique but is at
 least to the level of the GE junction.  There is a left-sided central venous
 catheter with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  There is
 unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is again seen pulmonary vascular congestion
 which is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low ET tube.  This could be pulled back 2 cm for more optimal placement.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube tip is not well seen due to technique but is at least to
 the level of GE junction.  Recommend repeat CXR or abdominal films for further
 evaluation of the distal tip.
 
 3.  Unchanged persistent pulmonary edema.
 
 4.  Stable cardiomegaly.
