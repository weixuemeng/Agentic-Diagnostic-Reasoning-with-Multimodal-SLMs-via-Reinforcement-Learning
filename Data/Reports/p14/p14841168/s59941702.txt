                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p OGT  // OGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the ETT and dobhoff.  There is an
 orogastric tube seen with the tip and side hole below the diaphragm.  There is
 a right-sided PICC line, which is unchanged in positioning.
 
 There are ill-defined opacities at the left base, which likely represent
 atelectasis, but an underlying lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The left hilum is
 prominent, likely reflecting pulmonary hypertension.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriately positioned orogastric tube and PICC line.
 2. Ill-defined left basilar opacities, which likely represent atelectasis, but
 an underlying left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 3. Stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and left hilum.
