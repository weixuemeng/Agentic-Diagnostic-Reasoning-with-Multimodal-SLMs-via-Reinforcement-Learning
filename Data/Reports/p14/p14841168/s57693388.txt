                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and cough, question infection.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular dual-lumen large-bore catheter unchanged in
 position with the tip in the right atrium.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stably enlarged given patient's rotation.  Lung volumes are
 diminished.  There is perihilar fullness and indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature which would favor pulmonary edema rather than an acute infectious
 process.  However, clinical correlation would be advised as this could reflect
 an atypical infection.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.
