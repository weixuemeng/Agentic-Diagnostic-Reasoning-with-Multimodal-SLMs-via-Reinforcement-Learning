                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP SUPINE CHEST, ___ AT 16:51 HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and acidosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat limited secondary to positioning.  The
 patient is markedly rotated.  Again seen is a large-bore dual-lumen catheter
 from a left subclavian approach.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 again evident and slightly exaggerated.  There is engorgement of the vascular
 pedicle and cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity, which is likely at
 least in part due to the supine positioning.  Linear atelectasis is seen in
 the retrocardiac left lower lobe.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The
 mediastinum again demonstrates a tortuous aorta exaggerated by the rotation. 
 Likewise, the cardiac silhouette is stable, but exaggerated.  No large
 effusion is noted.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study, but overall grossly stable.  The slight
 engorgement is noted principally in the left hilar region may be in part due
 to recumbency.
