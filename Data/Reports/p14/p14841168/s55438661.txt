 PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low, despite
 endotracheal intubation.  There is worsening engorgement of the mediastinal
 vasculature and central pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is also new mild
 pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  A hemodialysis catheter terminates in
 the cavoatrial junction.
