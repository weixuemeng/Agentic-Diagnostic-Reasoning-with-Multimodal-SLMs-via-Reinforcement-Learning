                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope and cough for five days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 views are somewhat underpenetrated in part due to the patient's overlying arm.
 Given this, there is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis is seen.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is chronic.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable
 as comparison with ___.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
