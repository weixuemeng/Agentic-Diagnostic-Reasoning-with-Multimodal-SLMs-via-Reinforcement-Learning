                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Attempted line placement, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax following unsuccessful CVP attempt.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged and there is increased prominence of ill-defined pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragmatic contour is more prominent on this examination.
