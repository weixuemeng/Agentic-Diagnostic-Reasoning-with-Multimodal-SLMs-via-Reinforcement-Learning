                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p OR, intubation, OGT placement  // eval
 ? ETT placement, OGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.  In enteric tube
 terminates in the proximal stomach and could be advanced 5-6 cm for ideal
 positioning.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Low lung volumes. Minimal
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is also stable.  The left lung base is
 not visualized.  Increased opacity at the base of the left lung may reflect
 atelectasis.  There is mild vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube 4.1 cm of the carina.  Enteric tube should be advanced 5-6
 cm for ideal positioning.  No pneumothorax.  The left lung base is only
 partially imaged however opacity at the base of the left lung likely reflects
 atelectasis or aspiration.  Mild pulmonary edema.
