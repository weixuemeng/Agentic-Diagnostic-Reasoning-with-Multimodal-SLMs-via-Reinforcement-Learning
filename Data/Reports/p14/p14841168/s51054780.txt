                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Portable chest x-ray suggesting left lower lobe of opacity, further
 evaluation with lateral view. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs performed earlier on the same day on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.   Lung volumes
 remain low.  The previous noted left lower lung opacity is less conspicuous on
 this repeat study, and was likely artifactual due to rightward rotation.  On
 the lateral view, there is now a retrocardiac opacity without clear correlate
 on the frontal view, which was also present on prior radiographs.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity without clear correlate on frontal radiograph
 of unclear significance.  However in the appropriate clinical setting, this
 can represent pneumonia.
