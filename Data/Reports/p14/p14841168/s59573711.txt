                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with CKD, dCHF, HTN with chest pain and cough  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 AP portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors dating back to ___ with most recent
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hazy left basilar opacity which has been seen on multiple previous
 examinations.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear of consolidation.   Enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is similar compared to prior and likely exaggerated
 by portable technique and prominent mediastinal fat.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted throughout the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lung opacity potentially atelectasis or scarring given
 findings on multiple priors.  Please note that superimposed infection is not
 entirely excluded.  Consider PA and lateral for further assessment if desired.
