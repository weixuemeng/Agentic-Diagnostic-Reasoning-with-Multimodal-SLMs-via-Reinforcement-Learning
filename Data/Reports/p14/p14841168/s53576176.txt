 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with infected hemodialysis catheter,
 interval removal, question pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 AP portable chest film ___ at 8:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of a double-lumen right internal jugular large-bore
 catheter.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  Overall mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.  Lung volumes
 are somewhat low with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Some crowding of the perihilar vasculature, but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 effusions.  No large pneumothorax.
