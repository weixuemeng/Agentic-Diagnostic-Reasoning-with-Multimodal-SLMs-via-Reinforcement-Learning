                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, respiratory failure, Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new Dobbhoff tube.  The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The course of the tube is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, the radiographic appearance of the thoracic organs is similar to
 the previous examination.
