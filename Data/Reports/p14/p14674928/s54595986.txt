 PORTABLE AP FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube and right approach
 central venous catheters (x2) are in expected positions.  A nasogastric
 catheter is malpositioned with the tip at the level of the gastroesophageal

 repositioning of the enteric catheter, with the tip in the stomach.  Overall,
