  1. Standard position of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
  
  2. Widening of the superior mediastinum.  Further assessment with chest CTA is
  recommended.
  
  3. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
  lung volumes, but infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is currently listed as EU critical.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is noted looped within the stomach, with the tip coursing off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size
 is mildly enlarged.  Superior mediastinal contours are widened, and there is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 Bibasilar patchy opacities are nonspecific, possibly reflective of atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 
 2. Widening of the superior mediastinum.  Further assessment with chest CTA is
 recommended.
 
 3. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes, but infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
