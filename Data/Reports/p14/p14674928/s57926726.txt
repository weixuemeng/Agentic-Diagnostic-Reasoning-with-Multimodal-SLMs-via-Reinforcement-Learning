                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall similar appearance to recent radiograph except for slight
 decrease in extent of left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to resolving
 atelectasis.  No new focal areas of consolidation to suggest aspiration or a
 site of infectious pneumonia.
