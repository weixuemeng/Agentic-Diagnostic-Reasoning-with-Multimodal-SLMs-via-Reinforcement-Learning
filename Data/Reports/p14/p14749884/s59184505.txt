                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with previous chest tube  // underlying issues
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain very low.
 Platelike atelectasis is present at the right lung basis and a rather
 extensive left lower lobe atelectasis is again visualized. A area of pleural
 thickening on the left is more extensive than on the previous examination. 
 This might be caused by reaccumulating pleural effusion.  No pneumonia, no
 pneumothorax.
