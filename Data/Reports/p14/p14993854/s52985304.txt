                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:12 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man quadriplegic with respiratory failure secondary to
 pneumonia, after extubation  being weaned off oxygen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest imaging since ___, most
 recently ___:
 
 Previous recurrent right lower lobe collapse has improved, but there is
 bulbous enlargement of the right hilus.  The right lower lobe endobronchial
 obstruction seen on chest CTA ___ should be re-evaluated, at
 least with chest CT.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse persists, also target for imaging investigation. 
 There is no good evidence for pneumonia.  Pulmonary vascular congestion in the
 left upper lobe is an indication of cardiac decompensation, although heart
 size is top normal and unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not substantial.  Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
