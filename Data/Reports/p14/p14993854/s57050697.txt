 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:37 AM
  
  
  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph were provided.  A right PICC
  terminates within the mid to low superior vena cava.  Cardiomediastinal
  contours are stable.  Best appreciated on the lateral image, increased opacity
  in the lower probable left lobe is identified for which infectious process is
  difficult to exclude.  Probable bilateral small pleural effusions are noted. 
  No evidence of pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent fevers, for pulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC terminates at the caval atrial junction.  Lucency projecting over
 the left side of the mediastinum may be air within an incompletely collapsed
 left lower lobe instead, although it is difficult to exclude air within the
 mediastinum given the appearance.  Atelectasis is also seen at the right lower
 lobe.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Apical emphysema, right greater than
 left, is again noted.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lucency in the left mediastinum could reflect some air within a nearly
 collapsed left lower lobe, although pneumomediastinum would be difficult to
 exclude.  CT may be obtained for further characterization if clinically
 indicated.
