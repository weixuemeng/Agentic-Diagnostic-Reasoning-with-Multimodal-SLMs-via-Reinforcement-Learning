                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:34 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with persistent hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___.
 
 Severe bibasilar atelectasis probably fluctuates in severity, but is virtually
 complete currently.  Hyperlucency in the upper lungs may be either
 compensatory hyperexpansion or  emphysema.  CT scanning might be helpful to
 see if there is a reversible cause of severe atelectasis and the shunting that
 it produces.
 
 There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion and the heart size is normal.
