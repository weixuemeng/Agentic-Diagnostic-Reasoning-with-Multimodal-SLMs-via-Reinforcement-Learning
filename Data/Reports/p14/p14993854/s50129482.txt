                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted
 at the apices.  Linear opacities are again noted within both lower lobes,
 perhaps slightly worse in the interval on the right, most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, perhaps slightly worse on the right in the interval.
