                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Autonomic dysfunction with respiratory failure, now intubated.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 5.2 cm above the level of the carina,
 not significantly changed.  A left PICC ends in the mid SVC.  An enteric
 catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm and out of field-of-view
 inferiorly.  The side port of the catheter is near the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Right mid-to-lower lung opacities continue to improve.  There is
 mild plate-like bibasilar atelectasis, improved on the left. The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 definite pneumothorax, although the uppermost portion of both apices were
 excluded from this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improving right mid-to-lower lung  opacities.
 
 2.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Side port of enteric catheter is at the gastroesophageal junction. 
 Advancement is recommended.  This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 11:50 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
