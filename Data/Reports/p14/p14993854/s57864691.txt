                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old quadriplegic male with autonomic dysreflexia and
 malignant hypertension.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  On the frontal view, there is
 increased opacity at the right lung base medially, similar to prior.  This
 could represent residual atelectasis or scarring given perisistence although
 infection is not entirely excluded.  The left lung is grossly clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Mid thoracic dextroscoliosis may
 be positional.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right basilar opacity seen medially potentially due to
 persistent atelectasis,or scarring.  Infection is not entirely excluded.
