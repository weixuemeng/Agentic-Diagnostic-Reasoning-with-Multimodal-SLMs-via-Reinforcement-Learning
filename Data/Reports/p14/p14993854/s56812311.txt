                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right lower and middle lobes have partially reexpanded compared to
 the prior radiograph, and there has also been improved aeration at the left
 retrocardiac area.  Residual heterogeneous opacities in the right mid lung
 region could potentially be due to infectious pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Hyperlucency of right apex is in keeping with severe
 emphysema in this area on recent CT.  Within the left lung, there is improved
 aeration in the retrocardiac region with minimal residual atelectasis
 remaining.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and is accompanied by
 enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries, possibly representing pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.
