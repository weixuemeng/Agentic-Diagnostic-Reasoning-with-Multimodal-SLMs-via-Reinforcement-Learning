                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, low  oxygen saturation// Eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient positioning.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The heart size appears borderline
 enlarged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, with no focal
 consolidation.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may suggest a trace
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and patchy bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
