                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with atrial flutter, hyponatremia, and leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate enlargement of
 cardiac silhouette is present. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings
 is suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Patchy ill-defined
 opacity in the right mid lung field is noted. No focal pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized. Streaky atelectasis is demonstrated at the lung
 bases. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Patchy opacity within
 the right mid lung field may reflect asymmetric pulmonary vascular engorgement
 though infection is not completely excluded.
