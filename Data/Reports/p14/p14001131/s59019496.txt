                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, report of
 respiratory distress, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, compatible with mild
 cardiomegaly. The bilateral hila are normal.  There is a suboptimal
 respiratory effort and low lung volumes. There is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion. The lungs are clear without evidence of focal
 consolidation. Apparent increased opacity at the lateral margin of the left
 mid lung likely relates to overlying breast tissue. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Stable mild cardiomegaly. No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
