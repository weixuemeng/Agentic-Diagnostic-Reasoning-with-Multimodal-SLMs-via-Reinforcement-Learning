 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, there is evidence of increasing
 radiodensity in the right lung apex.  Part of this observation might be caused
 by rotation of the patient.  However, coexisting developing pneumonia might
 also be present.  Short term radiographic followup is recommended.  Otherwise,
 the radiograph is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly and postoperative appearance
 of the left lung base is constant.
