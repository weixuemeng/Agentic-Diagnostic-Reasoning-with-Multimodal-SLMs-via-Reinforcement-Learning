                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There again surgical clips in the mediastinum.  The heart appears mildly
 enlarged.  There is increased prominence in the aortopulmonary window which is
 suggestive of enlarged left atrial appendage.  On the right there is probably
 a trace pleural effusion.  On the left, there is a small to moderate pleural
 effusion with associated opacity probably due to atelectasis in the posterior
 left lower lobe.  More generally, a moderate interstitial abnormality is most
 suggestive of congestive heart failure.  Fissures are thickened.  The right
 hilum appears more prominent than before and in addition there is the
 possibility of developing focal opacity at the right lung base.  Streaky
 opacities in the lingula appear unchanged suggesting background scarring and
 mild volume loss, as depicted on prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings consistent with moderate congestive heart failure including
 pleural effusions with suspected left basilar atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not
 excluded, however.
 
 2.  Possible developing opacity at the right lung base versus regional edema. 
 In addition to that, right hilum appears enlarged.  Although these findings
 may be congestive in nature, re-evaluation in follow-up radiographs is
 recommended after treatment.
