                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and cough x4 days.  Bilateral wheezes
 and rales on posterior lung fields  // please evaluate for causes of dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate surgical clips
 projecting over the left mediastinum.  The heart is unchanged in size, mildly
 enlarged.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, similar compared to ___.  Previously noted more focal opacity in the left mid lung at that time
 appears improved.  Patchy opacities in the right lower lung likely reflect
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, similar to ___.
 2. Patchy opacities in the right lower lung likely reflect atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
