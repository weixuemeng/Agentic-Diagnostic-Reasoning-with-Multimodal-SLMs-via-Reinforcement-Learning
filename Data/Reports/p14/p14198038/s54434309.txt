                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left rib pain status
 post fall, rule out rib 
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 left base atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  No
 definite pleural effusion is seen.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen; however, if clinical concern for rib fracture
 persists, suggest dedicated rib series.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small linear area of opacity in the left lung base most likely
 represents atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen, however, as finding is on side of patient
 pain, suggest dedicated rib series for further evaluation.
