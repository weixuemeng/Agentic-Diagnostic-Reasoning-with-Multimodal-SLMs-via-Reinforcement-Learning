                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness and left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT abdomen.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Small
 hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The
 lungs remain hyperinflated.  There has been interval improvement in patchy
 ill-defined opacity within the left lower lobe compared to the prior
 radiograph.  Additional minimal patchy opacity is seen within the right lower
 lobe, as noted on the CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval improvement in the left lower lobe pneumonia.  Additional
 patchy opacity within the right lower lobe is also concerning for an area of
 infection or aspiration.
