 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC makes an abrupt turn at the right tracheobronchial angle,
 likely entering the azygous vein.  This information was communicated to nurse
 ___ by Dr. ___ at 10 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.  Exam
 is otherwise remarkable for worsening hazy airspace opacities in the left
 upper lobe and juxtahilar region, as well as more confluent opacification in
 the left retrocardiac area.  Otherwise, no relevant short interval change.
