                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two serial radiographs of the chest were obtained as part of this
 exam acquisition.  On the first, a left PICC ends abruptly curving at the
 level of the right tracheobronchial angle, possibly entering the azygos vein. 
 On the second radiograph, the catheter has been successfully repositioned,
 with tip terminating in the expected location of the mid superior vena cava. 
 Exam is otherwise similar to the recent study performed approximately two
 hours earlier except for slight improvement in opacities within the left lung.
