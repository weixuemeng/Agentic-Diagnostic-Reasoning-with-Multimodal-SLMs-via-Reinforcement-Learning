                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 22:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of Crohn's disease and
 tachypnea, question any signs of infiltrate or pulmonary embolism.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 22:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes are low with patchy opacity in the left costophrenic angle,
 which may reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in technique and positioning between studies.  Please note that
 the essentially unremarkable chest film does not exclude pulmonary embolism,
 so if this remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT
 should be considered.
