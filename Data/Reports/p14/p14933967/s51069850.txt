                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  HIV, cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is possible trace pleural effusion on the
 right in the posterior costophrenic angle versus possible atelectasis.  There
 are streaky retrocardiac opacities, probably due to minor atelectasis or
 airway inflammation, perhaps slightly increased.  Mild rightward convex
 curvature is centered along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky new opacity in the left lower lobe, probably due to
 atelectasis or airway inflammation.  Developing pneumonia seems less likely
 but short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered to reassess.
