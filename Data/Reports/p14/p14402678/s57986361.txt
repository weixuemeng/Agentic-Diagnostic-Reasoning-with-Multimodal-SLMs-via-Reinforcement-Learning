                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax, with no
 visible pneumothorax.  Stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours.  Diffuse
 interstitial thickening, combined with alveolar opacities in the left mid and
 lower lung region have slightly worsened in the interval, and may reflect
 either asymmetrical edema or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Right lung is clear except
 for localized atelectasis at the right base.  Moderate left and small right
 pleural effusions are unchanged.
