                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mediastinal abscess with chest tube withdrawn.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed, and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Continued low lung volumes. 
 Extensive opacification in the left hemithorax persists, though appears to be
 improving.  The hemidiaphragms again are not well seen, consistent with
 atelectatic changes and effusion.
