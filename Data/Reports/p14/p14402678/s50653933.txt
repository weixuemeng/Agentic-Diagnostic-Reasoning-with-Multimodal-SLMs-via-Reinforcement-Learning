                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  One of three left chest tubes had been removed with a tiny left
 apical pneumothorax.  Combined alveolar and interstitial opacities in the left
 lung have slightly improved, particularly in the mid lung region.  There
 remains dense consolidation with air bronchograms at the left base.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated with adjacent area of atelectasis.  Small left
 partially loculated pleural effusion appears unchanged.  Within the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, air-fluid levels are present within mildly
 distended loops of bowel, possibly due to postoperative ileus, but
 incompletely evaluated on this radiograph.
