                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, pre-op.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of focal
 consolidation.  There is blunting of a posterior costophrenic angle presumably
 on the left suggestive of small effusion.  Note is made of an azygos lobe and
 fissure.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable left small effusion.  Otherwise essentially unremarkable chest x-ray.
