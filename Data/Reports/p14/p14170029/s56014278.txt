                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with resp distress.  Evaluate ET tube and OG tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina in
 appropriate position.  The tip of the orogastric tube is not clearly
 identified but the side port is below the GE junction.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema with areas of more patchy opacity at the lung bases, slightly
 more pronounced since the prior study.  Emphysematous changes are seen at the
 apices bilaterally.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  No large pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is seen.  A remote right distal clavicular fracture is again
 identified.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures appear subacute to chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Satisfactory position of the ET tube.  OG tube side port below the GE
 junction but the tip is not seen.
 
 2.  Slightly more pronounced bibasilar patchy opacities concerning for
 aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia.
