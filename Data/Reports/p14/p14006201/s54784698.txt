                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  On the
 frontal radiograph, lungs are grossly clear.  On the lateral view, there is a
 question of increased opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine, possibly due
 to crowding of normal structures related to relatively low lung volumes. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable basilar lung opacity on lateral radiograph, possibly
 due to summation of normal structures related to low lung volumes.  If
 clinical suspicion for infection persists, repeat radiograph with improved
 inspiratory level would be suggested for more complete evaluation of this
 region.
