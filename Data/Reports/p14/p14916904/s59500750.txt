                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fever, cough, COPD  // please eval pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings are seen in the
 lungs, particularly with an upper lobe distribution.  There is retrocardiac
 opacity and silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.  Some of this may be due
 to atelectasis given volume loss and leftward shift of the mediastinum. 
 Superimposed consolidation is possible.  Cardiac silhouette is grossly
 unchanged in size.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Might no height loss of
 mid thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis given left-sided volume loss
 although infection is possible.  Elsewhere, increased interstitial markings
 are seen in the lungs likely due to chronic underlying interstitial process or
 emphysema although superimposed interstitial edema or atypical infection are
 possible.
