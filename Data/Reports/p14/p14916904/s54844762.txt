                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, treated for CAP and febrile again 
 // Interval change in PNA, any abnl
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the interstitial markings have improved,
 suggesting that this may have reflected interstitial edema or less likely an
 interstitial infiltrate.  At present, no increased interstitial markings or
 CHF is identified.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to prior, possibly minimally improved.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement increased interstitial markings.  No current evidence of
 CHF.
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
