 lungs are clear except for linear scar in the periphery of the right lung
 base.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change.
 Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of mild scoliosis as well
 as mild compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essential resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia.
