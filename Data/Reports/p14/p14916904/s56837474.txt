 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD  // f/u pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dense opacification of the left lower lobe traversed by air bronchograms and
 left mediastinal shift are unchanged since ___.  Pulmonary edema
 from ___ has resolved.  Linear opacities are demonstrated
 bilaterally suggestive of emphysema.  Indeterminate size of partially obscured
 cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.  Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Likely chronic lobar collapse, alternatively pneumonia.  Continued
 follow-up is advised.
 2.  Stable emphysema.
 3.  Resolved pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1 month chest x-ray follow-up is recommended to assess for
 clearance of left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.  If there is no
 substantial clearance at that time, CT imaging should be considered.
