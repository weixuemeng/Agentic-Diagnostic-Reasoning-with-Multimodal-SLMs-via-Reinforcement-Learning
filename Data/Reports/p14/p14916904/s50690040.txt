 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Patient has known COPD.
 
 Increased opacities in the left lower retrocardiac region could be
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded, and followup after
 treatment is recommended.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Kyphosis is again noted with loss of volume of mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
