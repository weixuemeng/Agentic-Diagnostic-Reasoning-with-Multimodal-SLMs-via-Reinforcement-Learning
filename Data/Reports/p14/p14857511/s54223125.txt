                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Amiodarone with diastolic dysfunction.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without
 definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  This discordancy raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 The retrocardiac hiatal hernia is again seen.  Some impression on the lower
 side of the cervical trachea on the right could reflect some thyroid
 enlargement.
 
 Mild atelectatic changes at the bases but no acute focal pneumonia.
