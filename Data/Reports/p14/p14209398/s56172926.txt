                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alveolar hemorrhage and persistent O2
 requirement  // evaluate for progression/improvement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, heterogeneous and
 asymmetrically distributed opacities have substantially improved, with
 residual opacities predominantly in the right lung.  These findings may be due
 to resolving pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, and are superimposed upon
 underlying emphysema.  Small left pleural effusion is evident but there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
