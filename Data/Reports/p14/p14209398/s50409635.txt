 ___     Comparison film from ___ to assess for resolving pulmonary edema,
 effusion or if progression of acute changes noted by radiology report ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Predominantly interstitial abnormality most pronounced in the lower lobes has
 not improved anywhere and is slightly more extensive in the right lower lobe
 laterally, but previous pleural effusions are probably smaller.  Heart size is
 normal.  Differential diagnosis was discussed in my previous report.  The
 persistence makes simple pulmonary edema less likely.
