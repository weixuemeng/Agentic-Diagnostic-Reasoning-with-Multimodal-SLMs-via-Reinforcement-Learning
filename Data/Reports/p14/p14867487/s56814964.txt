 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.

 Slight indentation of the cervical trachea is suggestive of enlarged thyroid,
 which has been previously evaluated by ultrasound.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Nipple shadows should not be confused for
 nodules.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
