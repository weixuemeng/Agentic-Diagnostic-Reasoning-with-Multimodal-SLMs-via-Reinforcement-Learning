                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female post-operative day 2 from incarcerated
 incisional hernia repair with a 5-day history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest were obtained.  Bilateral
 opacities at the lung bases are again seen.  The left lung base opacity is
 linear and likely represents atelectasis.  The right lung base demonstrates
 increased radiodensity medially and likely represents resolving pneumonia. 
 The right internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position and appearance
 compared to prior radiograph.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is also
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  Evidence of abdominal mesh surgery is
 seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral basilar opacities representing resolving pneumonia. 
 Otherwise, unchanged chest radiographs.
