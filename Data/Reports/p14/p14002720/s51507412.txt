                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  occasional shortness of breath.  // r/o interstitial pneumonia
 and screening prior to initiation of methotrexate      r/o interstitial
 pneumonia and screening prior to initiation of methotrexate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Since chest CTA on ___ did not show emphysema
 this is presumably due to small airway obstruction.  The only focal
 abnormality in the lungs is a 14 mm wide round nodular opacity seen on the
 lateral view projecting anterior to the ascending thoracic aorta.  There was
 no corresponding abnormality in ___, but more than 4 months is sufficient time
 for a clinically significant nodule to developed.  I would repeat conventional
 chest radiographs in 4 weeks, with particular attention to the retrosternal
 region to see if there is any abnormality warranting chest CT at that time.
 
 There is no evidence of interstitial pulmonary abnormality or pneumonia.  .
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.  There is no pleural
 abnormality
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs in 4 weeks, should be shown
 to a chest radiologist before the patient leaves the department to see if
 additional views are indicated at that time or whether chest CT scan should be
 recommended.
