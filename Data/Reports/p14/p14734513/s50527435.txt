                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension and fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal views of the chest.  Diffuse prominent reticular
 interstitial lung markings are consistent with known emphysema/interstitial
 lung disease.  Increased pulmonary vascular markings and apparent
 cephalization are consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion with mild
 edema.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities are most consistent with atelectasis. 
 The heart size is normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.
