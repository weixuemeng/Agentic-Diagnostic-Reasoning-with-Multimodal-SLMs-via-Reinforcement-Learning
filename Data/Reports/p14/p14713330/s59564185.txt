 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities favor atelectasis, but
 differential diagnosis includes aspiration and infectious pneumonia.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  Biliary catheter is
 present in the upper abdomen.
