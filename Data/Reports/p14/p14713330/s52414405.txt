                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion on right and continued
 fevers  // Please assess for interval change in R pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion has a smaller dependent component, but still has
 a large loculated component posterior to the superior segment of the right
 lower lobe. A new gas collection in this region could be either in the pleural
 space, introduced by drainage, or in the lung which could represent
 cavitation. The right-sided drainage catheter is unchanged in position
 documented on CT scanning tube traverses the right pleural space and diaphragm
 en route to the liver abscess. Left lung is clear and left pleural space
 normal. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
