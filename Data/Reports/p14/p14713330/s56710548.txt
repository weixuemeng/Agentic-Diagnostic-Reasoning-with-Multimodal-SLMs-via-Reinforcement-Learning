                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fevers  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. As mentioned on the
 prior study, bibasilar linear template leg opacities favor atelectasis but
 differential diagnosis includes infectious pneumonia or aspiration. No pleural
 effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. A catheter is partially imaged
 projecting over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with likely bibasilar atelectasis.  Platelike and linear
 basilar opacities favor atelectasis, but as also mentioned on the prior study,
 infectious pneumonia or aspiration are also in the differential.
