 The right PICC line is unchanged in position. The lung volumes are extremely
 low.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Additionally, there is
 worsening opacity in the left lung base that may represent pleural effusion
 vs. atelectasis vs. pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.

 Worsening left lung base opacity that is most likely due to pleural effusion
