                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of congestive cardiac failure,
 found to have coronary artery disease status post thoracocentesis at an
 outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions with possible adjacent compressive atelectasis is noted. 
 Underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  There is an approximately 3.3 x 3.5 cm mass at the level of
 the right lower lobe as well as a 2-cm soft tissue density within the right
 upper lobe.   Mild prominence of the azygos vein is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A 3.5-cm mass of the right lower lobe as well as a second soft tissue
 density measuring at least 2 cm in the right upper lobe.  Recommend obtaining
 old images to document stability.  If these are not available, then additional
 imaging such as CT scan should be performed for further evaluation.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ via telephone.
