                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Evaluate for evidence of
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  The right lung is clear.  There is a
 retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, likely pneunonia vs
 atelectasis. There may be a tiny component of pleural effusion.  The heart
 size is top normal.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Sclerotic intramedullary lesion in the right humeral neck is
 unchanged and likely represents an enchondroma. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung base opacity consistent with pneumonia vs atelectasis.
 There may be an associated tiny pleural effusion.
