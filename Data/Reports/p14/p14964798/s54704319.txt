                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lung
 bases are somewhat underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  The patient
 is rotated somewhat to the left.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to accurately assess.  There are perihilar opacities bilaterally
 which may be due to edema.  If there is concern for underlying acute
 mediastinal process, chest CT is more sensitive.  There may be trace pleural
 effusions.  Underlying basilar consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underpenetration of the lung bases, particularly the left lung
 base likely due to patient body habitus.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 likely enlarged and if there is concern for acute mediastinal process, chest
 CT is more sensitive.  Perihilar opacities are likely due to pulmonary edema;
 however, underlying infectious process is not excluded.  Possible trace
 pleural effusions.
