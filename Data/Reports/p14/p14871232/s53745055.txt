                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and COPD with history of bronchomalacia and concern for CHF, to
 assess for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube measures approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends well into the stomach.  There are low lung volumes, which may
 account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. 
 No vascular congestion.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region is
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusions.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have considered.
