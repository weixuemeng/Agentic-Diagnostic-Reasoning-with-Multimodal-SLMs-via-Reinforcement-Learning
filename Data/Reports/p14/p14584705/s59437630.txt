                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 02:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 remains visible, but is grossly unchanged.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for technical differences. 
 Sternotomy wires and mitral valve again noted.  The left pulmonary artery
 appears prominent ,with a tapered appearance, which could reflect pulmonary
 hypertension.  The right pulmonary artery is likely obscured due to overlying
 structures.
 
 There is borderline upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Again seen
 is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and there
 subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 Left convex scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine, with a rotary component, is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change compared with 1 day earlier.  Small bilateral effusions,
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and subsegmental atelectasis at
 the right lung base are similar to the prior study.
