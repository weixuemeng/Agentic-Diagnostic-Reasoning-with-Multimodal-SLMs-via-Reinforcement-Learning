                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with L sided deficits  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Right apical opacity is nonspecific, could be due
 to pleural thickening/scarring however, no priors for comparison to assess
 chronicity.  No definite pneumonia is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal
 to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical opacity could be due to pleural thickening/ scarring, but no
 priors for comparison to confirm chronicity.  Consider nonurgent chest CT for
 further assessment.
 
 No definite pneumonia.
