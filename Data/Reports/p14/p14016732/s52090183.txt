                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus, status post intubation.  Evaluate position of
 endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 2.8 cm
 above the level of the carina.  There is minimal peribronchial opacification
 in the left lower lung, possibly atelectasis versus aspiration.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube, ending 2.8 cm above the level
 of the carina.
 
 2.  Heterogeneous left lower lung opacities, possibly atelectasis versus
 aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:20 a.m. via telephone
