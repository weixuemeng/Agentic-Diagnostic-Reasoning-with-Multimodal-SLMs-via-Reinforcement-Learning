                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with globus sensation in throat
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Rounded
 opacity projecting over the right lateral lung base is compatible with pleural
 fat as seen on the previous CT and is unchanged.  Pleural fat deposition also
 accounts for the smooth lateral pleural thickening noted bilaterally towards
 the bases.  Streaky atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly identified.  There are mild degenerative changes noted
 in the thoracic spine.  Vascular stent is seen projecting over the region of
 the left vessels.  No additional radiopaque foreign body is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiopaque foreign body identified except for the presence of a vascular
 stent in the region of the left axillary vessels.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
