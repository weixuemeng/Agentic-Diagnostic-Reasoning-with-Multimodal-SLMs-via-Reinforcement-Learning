                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rule out tuberculosis before hemodialysis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 lower lobe pneumonia has completely cleared.  The lung volumes remain low.  At
 the lateral aspect of the right lung base, visible on the frontal radiograph
 only, is a 2-3 cm pleural thickening, it is focal and adjacent to a rib. 
 Although the rib shows no signs of destruction.  The area should be further
 worked up by CT to exclude a neoplastic pleural process.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the finding was placed on to the
