                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:27 A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  Newly replaced Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Three serial chest radiographs show initial positioning of the Dobbhoff tube
 in the distal right lower lobe bronchial tree, then at the gastroesophageal
 junction, finally in the upper stomach.  None of the chest radiographs shows
 right pneumothorax, or evidence of bleeding in the right lung.  Presumed right
 pleural effusion is small.  Previous consolidation in the right lung laterally
 has improved since ___.  Left lower lobe, however, is more consolidated
 today with greater volume loss, indicating worsening of a component of
 atelectasis, despite at least a small left pleural effusion.  Followup for
 possible complications of the bronchial intubation and possible left lower
 lobe pneumonia.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Left PIC line ends
 in the upper SVC.
