                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MVC status post splenectomy and ORIF of the hip, now intubated,
 with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right IJ central venous
 catheter are unchanged in position.  The lung volumes are unchanged. 
 Retrocardiac opacification is again seen, likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 There is mild right basilar atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle may reflect small right pleural effusion.  The left costophrenic angle
 remains visible.  There is no significant pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and stable.  Known rib fractures are
 re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible small
 right pleural effusion.
