                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxemia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 New increased widespread opacity in the left lung is consistent with left
 upper lobe collapse  .  There is also marked decrease of volume in the left
 lower lobe.  The amount of pleural effusion cannot be assessed.  Improved
 opacity in the right lung due to redistribution of a large pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left.  The ET tube, right IJ catheter
 tip and NG tube are in unchanged standard positions.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 1:50
 p.m., two minutes after the discovery of the finding.
