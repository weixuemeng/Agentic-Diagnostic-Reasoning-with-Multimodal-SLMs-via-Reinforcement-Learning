                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:27.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter
 appears to be pulled back.  The tip of the catheter is coiled.  The last
 images of the series show the catheter within the proximal parts of the
 stomach.  The decision of repositioning the device should be made on the
 grounds of clinical criteria.
