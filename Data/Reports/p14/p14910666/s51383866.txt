                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma, status post MVC requiring intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is improved aeration of the left upper lobe from ___. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacification and hazy opacification at the left
 costophrenic angle likely reflects a pleural effusion with worsening left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  A small right pleural effusion is also seen.  There
 is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax on this semi-erect radiograph.  The
 tip of the endotracheal tube abuts the tracheal wall.  An enteric tube and
 right internal jugular catheter are unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is prominent in part related to low lung volumes and AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolved left upper lobe collapse but worsened left lower lobe atelectasis
 from ___.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 3.  ET tube tip abuts the tracheal wall.
