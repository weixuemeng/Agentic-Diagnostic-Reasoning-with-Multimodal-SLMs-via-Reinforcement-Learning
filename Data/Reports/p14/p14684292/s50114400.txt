                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Low lung volumes partially
 accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  However, there are no overt signs of
 edema.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The heart size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the
 aortic arch.  There is an age-indeterminate compression fracture of one of the
 lower thoracic vertebra along with a exaggerated kyphosis and anterior wedging
 of one of the upper thoracic vertebra that is partially obscured by the
 scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Age-indeterminate compression fractures of the thoracic spine.  Correlate
 clinically.
