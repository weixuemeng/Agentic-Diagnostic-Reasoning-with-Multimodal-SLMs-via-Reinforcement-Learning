                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post recent subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysm coiling with
 intubation for airway protection, presenting with new fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiograph of the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube appears unchanged.  A right subclavian central
 venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  An orogastric
 tube terminates near the pylorus, probably within the antrum, less likely but
 potentially the proximal duodenum.  There is patchy opacification obscuring
 the left hemidiaphragm with a suspected pleural effusion, potentially
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  In addition, a right infrahilar opacity appears
 slightly more prominent, although apparent change may be due to differences in
 technique.  Aspiration could also be considered as a possible etiology, noting
 the history.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar patchy basilar opacities with possible left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Differential considerations include atelectasis, but possibly
 pneumonia or even aspiration could be considered.  New right infrahilar
 opacity appears slightly more prominent, possibly due to technique, but
 attention in followup is suggested.
