                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:18 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure after cerebral
 angiography, evaluate for consolidation, effusion or clots.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 2:51.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film of ___ at 3:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing distally with the tip not identified on the
 current study.  There continue to be bibasilar airspace opacities, which have
 slightly worsened on the left when compared to the prior study and most likely
 represent bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Possible small layering left
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
