 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aneurysm, coiling, airway protection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.  The
 lung volumes have minimally decreased.  The diameter of the vascular
 structures is at the upper range of normal, potentially indicative of mild
 fluid overload, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Moderate
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  No new parenchymal opacities in the ventilated
 areas of the lung parenchyma.
