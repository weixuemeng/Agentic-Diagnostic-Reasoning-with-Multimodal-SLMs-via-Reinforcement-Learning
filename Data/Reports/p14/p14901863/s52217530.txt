                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient found down with large PE, aneurysm, and subarachnoid
 hemorrhage.  Remains intubated, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum with termination in the
 hypochondrium, but its tip is not well seen.
 
 ET tube remains in good position, well above the carina.
 
 Right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 Even allowing for projection, there may be mild cardiomegaly and mild
 prominence of the pulmonary arteries.
 
 The right costophrenic sulcus is essentially clear.  The left is not seen,
 reflecting probably a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  The
 appearances are not significantly changed from prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Unchanged appearance.  Probably left basal atelectasis and/or effusion.
