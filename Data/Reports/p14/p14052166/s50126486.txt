 eval for pneumo/effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16:13

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right internal jugular sheath.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement.  Stable postoperative cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  Small bilateral effusions with patchy opacity at
 the left base likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  Linear opacities in the
 left mid lung likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Calcification of the descending
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
