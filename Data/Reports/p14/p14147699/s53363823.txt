                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 7.3 cm above the carina.  The tip
 lies relatively high, approximately 14 mm above the upper edge of the medial
 clavicle.  Slight asymmetry of the clavicles is present, unchanged, with the
 right medial clavicular head more angulated and inferior compared to the left.
 An NG-type tube is present -- the tip is not well delineated and cannot be
 traced beyond the lower mediastinum.  
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, worse compared with ___, and
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible slight clearing at the right base.  Doubt
 gross effusion.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube as described, relatively high.  Clinical correlation requested.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse. 
 Atelectasis at right base, slightly better.
 3.  Asymmetric positioning of the right and left clavicular heads.  Is there a
 history of trauma to account for this?
