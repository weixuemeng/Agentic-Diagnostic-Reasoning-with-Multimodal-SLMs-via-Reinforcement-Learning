 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Coronary stenting is also
 noted.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion is
 seen.  Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable to slightly less prominent as compared to the
 prior study.  No pulmonary edema is seen.

 Small left pleural effusion.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to

 subtle consolidation.
