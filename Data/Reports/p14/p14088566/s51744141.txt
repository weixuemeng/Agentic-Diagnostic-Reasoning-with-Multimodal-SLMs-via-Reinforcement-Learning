                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The vascular structures are engorged, although there is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  With the history of ongoing
 hypotension, consider cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion as an etiology.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
