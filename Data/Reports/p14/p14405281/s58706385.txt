 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate-sized
 right pleural effusion which may have possible loculated component, with
 adjacent atelectasis of the right lower lung.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion with possible loculated

 for additional evaluation of possible loculation of pleural effusion if
 patient's condition permits.
