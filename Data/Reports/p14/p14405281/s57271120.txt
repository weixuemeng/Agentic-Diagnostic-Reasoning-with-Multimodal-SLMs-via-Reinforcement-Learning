                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view portable chest examination of ___.  The heart
 size remains within normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormalities
 are seen.  Appearance of thoracic aorta unchanged.  Comparison of the frontal
 views indicates an increased widening of the superior mediastinum with a now
 bulging mass to the left above the level of the aortic knob.  Similarly, there
 appears an increased thickening of the pleural space in the apical area on the
 left side.  Previously described and on chest CT identified nodular lesions in
 the left lung are again seen and appear rather unchanged.  The left lower lobe
 plate atelectasis which existed on the last examination has resolved.  The
 pleural density persists, although it appears to be slightly less than it was
 before.  No evidence of pleural effusion is identified on the right side.  As
 we now have a lateral view of the chest, we can identify mild blunting of the
 posterior pleural sinuses on both sides.  Demineralization of several
 vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine are identified and match the described
 metastatic lesions seen on CT of ___.  As per report of the chest
 CT examination, the patient has metastatic ovarian carcinoma, but also a
 left-sided breast mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left-sided small amount of pleural effusion.
 Noteworthy is now new widening of superior mediastinum to the left, apparently
 increased since last examination of ___
