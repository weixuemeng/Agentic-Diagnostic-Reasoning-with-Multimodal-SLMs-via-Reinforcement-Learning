 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST 
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 Now large right pleural effusion has markedly increased, and there is mild
 shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the left.  Cardiac size cannot be
 evaluated.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left lung is grossly clear.
