                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size with left ventricular
 configuration.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Scattered linear opacities in the mid and lower lungs probably represent a
 combination of atelectasis and scarring.  Patchy right lower lobe opacity with
 associated volume loss favors atelectasis over infectious pneumonia.  PA and
 lateral chest radiograph may be helpful for more complete evaluation of this
 region if warranted clinically.
