                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post single-chamber ICC
 placement.  Confirm lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable, but follows the
 course of a moderate S-shaped scoliosis in the mid and lower thoracic spine. 
 No local contour abnormalities are seen.  A permanent pacer capsule is noted
 in left anterior axillary chest wall position being connected to one
 intracavitary electrode having the distal typical appearance of an ICD.  The
 tip of the line is in a position compatible with the apical portion of the
 right ventricle.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of
 acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Mild elevation of the left-sided
 diaphragm is noted, apparently related to moderately gas-distended left-sided
 colonic bowel flexure.  On the lateral view, the patient was able to elevate
 the left arm (related to recent pacer placement), but the cardiac area and
 diaphragmatic contours still remain well visible. 
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Single intracavitary electrode ICD in correct position.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax, no cardiac enlargement and no pulmonary congestion.
