 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal hilar contours
 are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Retrocardiac streaky opacity
 is not substantially changed, likely atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Lateral pleural thickening

 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.

 Streaky retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
