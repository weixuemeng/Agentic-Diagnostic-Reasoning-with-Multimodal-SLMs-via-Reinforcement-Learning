                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 are noted.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with mild
 calcification noted at the aortic knob.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of COPD. Mild bibasilar airspace
 opacities could suggest infection or aspiration.
