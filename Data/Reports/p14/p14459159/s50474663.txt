                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sepsis from R sided neck abscess s/p I D by ENT, still
 intubated  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube has
 been slightly advanced, now terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.
 This could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning.  Note is also made
 of subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular region with apparent
 adjacent surgical packing material, not well evaluated on this portable chest
 exam.  Within the chest, bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace
 opacities have worsened in the left mid lung and slightly improved in the
 right lower lung.  These findings could be due to multifocal aspiration and/or
 infectious pneumonia.
