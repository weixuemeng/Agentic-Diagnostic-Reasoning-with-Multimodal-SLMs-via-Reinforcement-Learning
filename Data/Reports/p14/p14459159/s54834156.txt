  1.  Ill-defined focal opacity in the left upper lobe and left mid lung field,
  concerning for an acute infectious process, likely corresponding to
  incompletely imaged tree-in-___ opacities on prior dedicated neck CT.2.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with mediastinal fluid collection, tachycardic,
 rigoring  // Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process, pneumothorax,
 infiltrate, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside neck CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  There is an ill-defined opacity occupying the left upper lobe and
 mid left lung, which is concerning for an acute infectious process.  This area
 likely corresponds to incompletely imaged tree-in-___ opacities seen on prior
 dedicated neck CT.  The right hemi thorax is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema is present the
 right neck, better assessed on prior neck CT examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Ill-defined focal opacity in the left upper lobe and left mid lung field,
 concerning for an acute infectious process, likely corresponding to
 incompletely imaged tree-in-___ opacities on prior dedicated neck CT.
 2. Redemonstration of subcutaneous emphysema in the right neck, better
 assessed on prior neck CT.
