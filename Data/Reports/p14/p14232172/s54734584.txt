                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Since the prior examination there has been resolution of right
 perihilar opacification but interval development of right basilar
 opacification.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable demonstrating
 borderline cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascularity is not increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar opacification could either relate to aspiration
 or early pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution with repeat radiographs
 in six weeks.
