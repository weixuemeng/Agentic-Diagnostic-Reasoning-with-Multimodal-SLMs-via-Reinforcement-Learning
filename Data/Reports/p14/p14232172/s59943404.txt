                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  HIV on inhalers, with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 prominence of the interstitium may be due to minimal interstitial edema. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Smooth opacities along the upper to mid right and left upper
 chest may relate to pleural fat.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Slight prominence of the interstitial markings/vasculature may be
 due to minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation.  Please note that
 PCP may be radiographically occult.
