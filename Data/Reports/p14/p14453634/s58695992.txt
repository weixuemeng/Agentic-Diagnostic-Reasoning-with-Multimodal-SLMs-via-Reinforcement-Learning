                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Crohn's disease status post ileocecectomy, complicated by
 anastomotic leak and fecal peritonitis, now with respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to prior exam, there has been increase in severity of
 diffuse alveolar consolidations, particularly in the right apex and entire
 left lung.  Large right consolidation in the right apex displays possible
 central cavitation.  Small bilateral effusions are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A right PICC is unchanged in position, terminating in the low
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Worsening diffuse alveolar consolidations with air bronchograms with possible
 central cavitations of right apical consolidation representing ARDS, pneumonia
 or edema.
