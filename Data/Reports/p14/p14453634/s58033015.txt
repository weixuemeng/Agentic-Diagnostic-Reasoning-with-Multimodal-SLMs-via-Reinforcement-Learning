                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 A radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained to assess
 the presence of a feeding tube, which terminates in the distal stomach near
 the expected location of the gastroduodenal junction.  There is otherwise no
 relevant short interval change in the appearance of the chest since the recent
 radiograph of earlier the same date when allowances are made for differences
 in technique and projection.
