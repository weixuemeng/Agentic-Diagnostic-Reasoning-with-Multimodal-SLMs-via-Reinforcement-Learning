                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, triangular-like opacity is seen projecting over the left mid
 to lower lung which may be due to atelectasis/scarring or a small focus of
 infection.  Additionally, there is now slight increase in the left lateral
 basilar and retrocardiac opacities, which may be due to infection.  There has
 been an interval decrease in previously seen pleural effusion.
