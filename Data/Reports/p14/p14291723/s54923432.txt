                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure with poor oxygen saturation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are bilateral interstitial opacities with prominence, cephalization, and
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Left hemidiaphragm appears blunted, likely due to a small pleural
 effusion.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  
 More confluent right basilar opacities may represent an overlying early
 infectious process.  Ossific density is noted at the level of the inferior
 posterior labrum and nonspecific but may represent a reverse Bankhart fragment
 from prior injury.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with small left pleural effusion. 
 
 2.  Right basilar opacities may represent an overlying infectious process.
