                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p et  // et location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn so that it now terminates approximately
 1.2 cm above the level of the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately
 1-2 cm for more optimal positioning.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect at out of the field of view.  Low lung volumes
 persist.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are seen suggesting pulmonary edema
 with possible underlying aspiration.  Left base opacity may be due to
 combination of atelectasis, small pleural effusion not excluded.
