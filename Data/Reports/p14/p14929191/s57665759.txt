  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggest pulmonary edema,
  underlying pulmonary contusion not excluded in the setting of trauma.
  
  Difficult to exclude rib fracture on this study.  If there is high clinical
  concern, chest CT is more sensitive.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall with left lower rib pain  // eval for rib
 fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is somewhat rotated to the left.  The lungs are hyperinflated,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Increased interstitial
 markings bilaterally suggest pulmonary edema, underlying pulmonary contusion
 not excluded in the setting of trauma.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  Difficult to exclude rib fracture on
 this study.  If there is high clinical concern, chest CT is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggest pulmonary edema,
 underlying pulmonary contusion not excluded in the setting of trauma.
 
 Difficult to exclude rib fracture on this study.  If there is high clinical
 concern, chest CT is more sensitive.
