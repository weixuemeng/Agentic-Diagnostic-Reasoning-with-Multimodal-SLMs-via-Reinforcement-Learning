                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities, most pronounced in the right perihilar region
 is concerning for infection given the provided history.  Increased opacities
 in the bilateral infrahilar regions could be infection or aspiration. 
 Horizontal linear opacity projecting over the right mid lung may be focal
 scarring.  The heart remains enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists.  9-mm opacity just to the right of the trachea is probably a vessel
 on-end, although could also be a nodule.  There may be a trace right pleural
 effusion on the lateral view.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Severe levoconvex scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine, mild dextroconvex
 scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine, and mild levoconvex scoliosis of the
 upper lumbar spine is overall unchanged with associated severe distortion of
 the thoracic cage and appearance of the mediastinum.  The bones are diffusely
 demineralized, making it difficult to assess for fractures; however,
 significant loss of vertebral body height at multiple levels in the thoracic
 spine is noted and appears to have been present on the CT from ___.
 
 The stomach is distended with fluid and gas.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings concerning for multifocal infection and aspiration.
 2.  Multiple thoracic vertebral body compression deformities.
 3.  Severe cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 4.  Markedly distended stomach.
