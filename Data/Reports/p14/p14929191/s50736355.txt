                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and shortness of breath, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single frontal portable view of the chest was performed.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  There are prominent,
 predominantly basilar, interstitial markings which reflects pulmonary edema
 from biventricular failure.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Calcifications
 are seen within the aortic arch.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
