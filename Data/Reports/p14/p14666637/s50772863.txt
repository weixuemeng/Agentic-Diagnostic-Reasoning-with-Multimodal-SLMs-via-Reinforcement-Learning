                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New NGT, question placement.
 
 COMPARISON: CXR from ___ at 17:08 p.m
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Opacity over the right upper lung appears to represent a face mask, with an
 apparent tracheostomy component. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 similar to the prior film.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  There is new patchy opacity at the right lung base and continued
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  No gross effusion.  Changes at the right
 base could represent either atelectasis, aspiration or a pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 On the film available to me under this clip number, no NG tube is identified
 within the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No NG tube identified on this film.
 2.  Patchy opacity at right base, larger than on the prior film.
