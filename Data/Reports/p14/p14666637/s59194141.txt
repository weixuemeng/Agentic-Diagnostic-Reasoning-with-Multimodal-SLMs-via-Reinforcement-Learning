                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICH, fevers, unknown etiology.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___.
 
 A tracheostomy is in place.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is probable mild cardiomegaly.  The
 ascending aorta appears unfolded.    Prominence of the ascending aorta appears
 greater than on the prior film, but is also likely exaggerated by oblique
 positioning and lordotic AP technique.
 
 There is band-like atelectasis at the right base and also some patchy
 atelectasis in the retrocardiac region with linear atelectasis at the left
 base.  
 
 No gross effusion.  Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 aspiration or early pneumonic infiltrate on the right side would be difficult
 to exclude.
