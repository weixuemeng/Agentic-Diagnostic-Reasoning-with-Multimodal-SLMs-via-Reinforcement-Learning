                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___, assess tracheostomy NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, SUPINE
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 10:33 a.m.
 
 A tracheostomy appears to be present, but is not well delineated on these
 views.  No conventional NG tube is identified.  A small radiopacity projects
 over the expected location of the stomach and appears to be associated with a
 very thin curvilinear density seen in the upper abdomen.  There is also thin
 vertical linear opacity seen over the neck and upper mediastinum.  These
 likely connect, but are very hard to discern on this radiograph.  
 
 Low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable slight
 improvement at the right base compared with the earlier film.  Doubt overt
 CHF.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy is not as well visualized on the current film as on the prior
 film, ? due to technical factors.
 
 2.  Very thin linear density seen through portions of the mediastinum and also
 in the upper abdomen, with a radiopaque tip overlying the stomach.  Clinical
 correlation is requested to confirm that this corresponds to the NG or
 orogastric tube placed.
 
 3.  Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, improved on the right.
 Air bronchograms seen in the retrocardiac region are consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.
