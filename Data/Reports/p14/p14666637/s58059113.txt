                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICH, status post Dobbhoff.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEWS CENTERED AT THE DIAPHRAGM: 
 
 The Dobbhoff tube extends beneath the inferior edge of this film. I suspect it
 loops below the edge of the film and that the radio-opaque tip then courses
 superiorly back into the field of view. 
 
 If the radiopaque segment seen on this exam is the Dobbhoff, then it probably
 lies in the stomach and has not passed beyond the pylorus.   
 The lower right chest is excluded from the film.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged compared with ___ at 4:53 a.m.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is again noted.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 is now seen and could reflect a small effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobhoff tube tip probably lies in the stomach and has not passed
 beyond the pylorus, but is not imaged in its entirety.  If clinically
 indicated, an abdominal film could help to lay out the entire course of the
 Dobhoff tube.
