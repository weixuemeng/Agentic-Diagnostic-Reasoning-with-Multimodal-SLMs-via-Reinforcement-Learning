                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Positive PPD and recent presumed acute bronchitis with improved
 symptoms.  QuantiFERON is pending.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate diffuse interstitial
 opacities involving much of the left mid and upper lung.  There is no hilar
 lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung interstitial opacities of unknown age.  In a patient
 with a history of positive PPD and recent respiratory symptoms, primary
 tuberculosis cannot be excluded.  Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is also possible
 as well.  Further evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
