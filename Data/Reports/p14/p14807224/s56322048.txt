                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, fever, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Opacity at the
 left lung base could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  There is likely
 a small left pleural effusion.  The right lung appears clear, though volumes
 are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  A retrocardiac density
 is noted which could reflect the presence of a hiatal hernia.  Bony structures
 appear intact with degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine and upper
 lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal opacity, likely atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
