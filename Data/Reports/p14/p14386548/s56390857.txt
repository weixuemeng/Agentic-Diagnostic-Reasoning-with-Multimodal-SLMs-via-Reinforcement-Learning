                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pacer placed now with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  There is a
 dual lead left-sided pacemaker again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly
 persists.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal evaluation on the lateral view due to the patient's overlying arm. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
