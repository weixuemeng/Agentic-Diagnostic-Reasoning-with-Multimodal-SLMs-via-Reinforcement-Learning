                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after cystogastrostomy with
 stent placement and now new PICC line placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable, unremarkable.  Left lower lobe linear opacities and
 small right lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis but
 attention to this area to exclude the possibility of developing infection is
 recommended.  In the left suprahilar area, there is more nodular opacity noted
 than on the prior study.  Although it might reflect summation of shadows, it
 should also be followed to exclude the possibility of developing infectious
 process.
 
 In the upper portion of the abdomen, there are drains noted, partially imaged.
