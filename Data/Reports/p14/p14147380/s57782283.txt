                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New onset of fever in a patient after ERCP.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for right
 upper lobe suprahilar opacity, seen on ___ radiograph, but not
 seen on ___ radiograph.  This might potentially represent
 summation of shadows, but slowly progressing infectious process in this
 location cannot be excluded.  Correlation with chest CT might be considered.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right upper lobe draining
 catheter is partially imaged.
