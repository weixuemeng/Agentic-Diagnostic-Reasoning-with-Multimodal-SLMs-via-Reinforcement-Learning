                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post chest tube removal, evaluate
 for possible pneumothorax and worsening effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  During the examination
 interval, the previously present pig-tail end drainage catheter on the right
 base has been removed.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Some small amount of
 pleural effusion blunts the lateral pleural sinus and results in some hazy
 appearance of the right lung base, but the amount of fluid is not likely to
 have increased significantly.  On the left base, the amount of pleural
 effusion appears stable.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax following chest tube removal on right side.  No
 significant interval change in amount of pleural effusions.
