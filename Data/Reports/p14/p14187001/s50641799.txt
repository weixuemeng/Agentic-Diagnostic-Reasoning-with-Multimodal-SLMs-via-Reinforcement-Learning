                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with now status post bronchoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:12 chest radiograph and ___ at
 18:31 CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, there has been no substantial interval change from the previous exam.
 There is re- demonstration of the right lower lung mass containing a fiducial
 marker with asymmetric increased interstitial opacities noted in the right
 lung compared to the left, again suggestive of lymphangitic spread of tumor
 and/or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are also seen within the
 right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia, as demonstrated on the recent CT. 
 Hyperinflation of the left lung is again noted with a small left pleural
 effusion, unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified. Tracheostomy tube is in
 unchanged position. Cardiomediastinal contours are similar with persistent
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study.
