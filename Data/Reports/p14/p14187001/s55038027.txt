                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF, squamous cell lung cancer s/p
 gamma knife and cardiac lymphoma (in remission) who presented to an OSH for
 hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have M. cat an MRSA PNA  // Please
 assess for interval change, and any acute pulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The
 bilateral pleural effusions are constant in extent and severity. Also constant
 are the subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung bases and a moderate
 cardiomegaly. The right predominant parenchymal opacities, likely caused by
 the small right lung volume and there potential infection, have not
 substantially increased in extent since the previous examination.  No new
 parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.
