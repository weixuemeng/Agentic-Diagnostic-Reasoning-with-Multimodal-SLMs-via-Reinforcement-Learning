                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and hypoxemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube that appears to be well
 positioned.  There are lower lung volumes.  Substantial bilateral effusions
 are again seen with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some element of elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
