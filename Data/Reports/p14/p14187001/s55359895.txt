                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Again there is evidence of bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis.  These appear somewhat less
 prominent on the current study.  The areas of parenchymal opacification
 bilaterally appear to be slowly improving.
