                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with squamous lung cancer, intubated, vented,
 g-tube fed, admitted for PNA.  // Please evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient assumes a different
 position. The tracheostomy tube as well as the pigtail catheter in the right
 pleural space are unchanged.  The lung bases have minimally increased in
 reviewed transparency, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. However,
 small bilateral pleural effusions are still visible.  The known right hilar
 process is constant. Constant position of the left PICC line.
