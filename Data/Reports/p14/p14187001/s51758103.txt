                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bronchoscopy and fiducial placement.  Assess fiducial
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The lungs appear well expanded with right infrahilar mass
 redemonstrated.  Thin linear density projecting within this lesion may reflect
 the fiducial marker though it is not well seen.  Cardiac size and tortuous
 aortic contour are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax with a thin linear density in the infrahilar mass
 in the right lung perhaps reflecting the fiducial marker.
