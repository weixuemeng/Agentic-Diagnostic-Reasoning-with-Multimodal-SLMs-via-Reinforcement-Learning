                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Evaluation is somewhat limited due to kyphotic positioning and patient
 rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube tip is seen below the diaphragm, though the side
 port appears to be above the gastroesophageal junction, and this tube should
 be advanced.    The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuates the width of the mediastinum.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  Small left pleural
 effusion is noted.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no
 overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
