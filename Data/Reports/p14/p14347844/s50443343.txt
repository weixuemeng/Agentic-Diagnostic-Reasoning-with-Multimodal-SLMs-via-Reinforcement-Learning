 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. There is minimal streaky density consistent with
 subsegmental atelectasis as before.  In addition, there is increased density
 in the right lung base that is more confluent. The heart and mediastinal
 structures are unchanged. The patient has been extubated.  A left subclavian
 catheter remains in place.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post extubation.  There is interval development of increasing density
 in the right lung base that may represent parenchymal consolidation.
