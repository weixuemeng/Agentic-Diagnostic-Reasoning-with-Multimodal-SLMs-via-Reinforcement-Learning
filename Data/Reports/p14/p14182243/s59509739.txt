                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic pain, acute worsening with numbness and tingling in
 extremities, preoperative evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scoliosis series ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This causes accentuation of the cardiac
 silhouette size which is likely moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded. 
 Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is likely exaggerated by AP
 technique and low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Marked degenerative
 changes of the right glenohumeral joint are incompletely imaged. 
 Thoracolumbar scoliosis is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
