                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and new hypoxia.  Evaluate for atelectasis,
 effusions or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Extensive orthopedic hardware is only
 partially imaged.
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  Pulmonary edema has resolved.  Right lung
 opacity is improved from prior but still persists, possibly atelectasis and a
 small pleural effusion.  Linear atelectasis at the left base persists.  There
 is no focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.
