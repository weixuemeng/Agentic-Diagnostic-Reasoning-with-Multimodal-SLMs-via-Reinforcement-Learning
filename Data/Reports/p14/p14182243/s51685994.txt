 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right
 basilar opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.  A component
 of atelectasis is also in the differential.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  There may
 be some central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Old right-sided rib
 deformities are seen.  The partially imaged right humeral hardware is similar
 in appearance compared to ___.  Partially imaged cervical spine hardware
 is again noted.  There appears to be a partially imaged prior fracture of the
 left humeral shaft.  Partially imaged thoracolumbar hardware not well
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia or
 aspiration.  A component of atelectasis is also in the differential.  Vascular
 congestion and cardiomegaly.
