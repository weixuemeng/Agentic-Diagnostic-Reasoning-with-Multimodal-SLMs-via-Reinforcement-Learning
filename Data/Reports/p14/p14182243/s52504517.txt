                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:24
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with desaturation status post lumbar spine
 surgery.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:24 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is rotated to her right, but given this limitation, the overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  Lungs appear slightly
 lower in volume with indistinctness of the vascularity suggestive of
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Given the
 technique, evaluation for pleural effusions is limited.  Incompletely
 visualized hardware overlying the lower cervical spine and lower thoracic
 spine.  In addition, there is a right shoulder replacement, which is
 incompletely visualized.
