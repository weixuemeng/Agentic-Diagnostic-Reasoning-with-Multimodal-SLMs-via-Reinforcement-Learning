                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs of ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is unchanged double contour to the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Although difficult to completely exclude, there are no
 definite pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacity
 has improved.  Right basilar opacity has also improved.  There is mild
 coarsening of lung markings, but not necessarily an acute finding.  Patchy
 left mid lung opacities suggest residual atelectasis.  The patient is status
 post incompletely characterized cervical fusion.  The patient is also status
 post right shoulder replacement.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved bibasilar opacities.  Similar mild interstitial process;
 chronic vascular congestion or airway inflammation could account for this
 appearance.
