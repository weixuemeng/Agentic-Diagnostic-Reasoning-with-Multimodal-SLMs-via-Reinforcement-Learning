                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest tube pulled recently.  Evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately 10 hours prior to this
 study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post spinal fixation.  Multiple monitoring and
 supporting devices are reidentified, including a right-sided central line
 ending in the lower SVC, an endotracheal tube ending approximately 5 cm above
 the carina, and an NG tube which ends below the gastroesophageal junction with
 the tip out of view.  There has been interval removal of a right-sided chest
 tube, without evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 The right lung is clear.  In the left lung, there has been interval
 development of perihilar and lower lung opacities, with obscuration of
 portions of the right hemidiaphragm margin.  An oblong silhouette projecting
 over the left upper lung is likely external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax.  New perihilar and left
 lower lung consolidation may represent atelectasis. Aspiration would be
 unusual in this intubated patient.
