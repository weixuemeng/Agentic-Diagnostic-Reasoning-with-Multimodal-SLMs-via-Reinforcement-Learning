                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis although a mild/early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity is slightly more conspicuous as compared to
 the prior study most likely due to atelectasis, although an early infection is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
