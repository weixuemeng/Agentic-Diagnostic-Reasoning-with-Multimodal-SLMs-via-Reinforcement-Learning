                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 17:11 HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Post bicycle accident with syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient was imaged in a lordotic position, which distorts the
 mediastinal contours.  Within that limitation, the lungs are clear without
 consolidation or edema.  The mediastinum is otherwise unremarkable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is noted.  No displaced fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limitations as above.  Otherwise, no radiographic evidence of
 acute traumatic injury to the chest.
