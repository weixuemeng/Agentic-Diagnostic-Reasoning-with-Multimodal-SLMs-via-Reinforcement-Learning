                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, increased mucus production - eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  A tracheostomy tube is in
 place with with an overlying oxygen mask. The lung volumes are quite low.
 Bibasilar opacities are seen most suggestive of atelectasis versus scarring at
 the right lung base and atelectasis and probable small effusion on the left.
 The possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude. The mid
 to upper lungs appear well aerated. Heart size appears grossly stable. The
 mediastinal contour is unchanged. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with probable small left effusion. Tracheostomy tube
 noted.
