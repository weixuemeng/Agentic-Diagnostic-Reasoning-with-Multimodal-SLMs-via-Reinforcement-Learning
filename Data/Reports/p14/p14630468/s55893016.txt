                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with permanent tracheostomy, and 1 day increased
 sputum and suctioning requirements
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18: O2
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no substantial interval change compared to the previous exam. 
 Small right pleural effusion is again demonstrated with bibasilar streaky
 opacities likely reflective of atelectasis. Infection in the right lung base
 cannot be completely excluded. A trace left pleural effusion is likely
 present.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflective of atelectasis though infection in the
 right lung base cannot be completely excluded.
