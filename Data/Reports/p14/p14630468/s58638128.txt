 HISTORY:  Laryngeal cancer and pneumomediastinum.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Pneumomediastinum remains evident, though
 slightly smaller than on the prior exam.  Heart size and mediastinal contours
 are otherwise stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 bibasilar opacities have both slightly improved since the prior exam, though
 with persistent left lower lobe collapse.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy and
 PEG tube are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small amount of pneumomediastinum, slightly improved. 
 2.  Slightly improved small bilateral pleural effusions with persistent left
 lower lobe collapse.
