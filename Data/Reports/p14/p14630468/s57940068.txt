 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in place in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar opacities are similar on the
 left and slightly improved on the right.  A focal opacity adjacent to minor
 fissure is also unchanged.  Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated,
 left greater than right.  Pneumomediastinum is evident, similar to the
 previous study, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent pneumomediastinum.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, improved on the right, similar on the left.
 
 3.  Unchanged pleural effusions.
