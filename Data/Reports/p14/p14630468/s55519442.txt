 Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position. Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Small right pleural effusion is demonstrated with streaky linear
 opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is seen in the
 left upper quadrant. No acute osseous abnormalities are present.

 Small right pleural effusion, new in the interval. Bibasilar streaky linear
