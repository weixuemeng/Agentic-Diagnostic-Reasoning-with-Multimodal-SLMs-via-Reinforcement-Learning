                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of CHF, acute on chronic dyspnea on
 exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is slightly limited by lordotic positioning.  Heart size is mild to
 moderately enlarged.  Widening of the mediastinum superiorly may be due to the
 presence of mediastinal lipomatosis.  Hilar contours are unremarkable, and
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are mildly hyperinflated without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of congestive heart failure.  Widening of the superior mediastinum
 may relate to mediastinal lipomatosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Comparison with previous chest radiographs is recommended
 to assess for stability of the superior mediastinal widening.
