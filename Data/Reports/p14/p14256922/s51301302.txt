                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient postoperative day #4 status post bypass
 surgery, evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is postoperative and examination required performance
 in sitting position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is
 made with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy and bypass surgery, moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, unchanged in comparison with the next preceding portable
 examination.  No remaining pneumothorax.  Left-sided pleural density persists
 with moderate elevation of the diaphragm.  The lateral view discloses the
 pleural density on the left side, which blunts the posterior pleural sinus. 
 The amount is deemed to be of moderate degree.  No new pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormalities are identified, and the right hemithorax remains unchanged and
 within normal limits.  In comparison with the preoperative chest examination
 of ___, significant enlargement of the cardiac silhouette remains
 finding which most likely relates to postoperative pericardial effusion.  The
 pulmonary vasculature does not show evidence of marked congestion in
 comparison with the preoperative study.
