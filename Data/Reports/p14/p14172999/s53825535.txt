                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain, EKG shows changes suggestive of
 pericarditis, rule out constriction or pericardial effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable except
 for unchanged deviation of the trachea towards the left, which could be due to
 a thyroid nodule.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no evidence of pericardial effusion on this exam, which is not
 sensitive for a small amount of fluid.  The cardiac contour is normal.
 2.  Possible right thyroid enlargement to be investigated with dedicated
 sonogram if needed.
