                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip terminating
 approximately 3.3 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is within the
 stomach.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable. There are
 worsening ill-defined opacities within the left long, now appearing somewhat
 confluent, as well as minimal patchy opacity in the right lower lobe. Mild
 upper zone pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  No large pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval intubation with endotracheal tube in standard position.  Enteric
 tube tip within the stomach.
 2. Worsening, ill-defined, more confluent opacities within the left lung as
 well as patchy opacity within the right lower lung field.  Findings are
 concerning for infection with superimposed mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
