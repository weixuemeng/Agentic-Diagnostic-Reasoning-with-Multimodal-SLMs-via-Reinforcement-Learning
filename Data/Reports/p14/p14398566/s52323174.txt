                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  // ?
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 551
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, there may have been slight improvement in
 CHF findings.  Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
 
 ET tube tip lies 4.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip extends beneath
 diaphragm overlying the upper stomach.  The sideport lies in the region of the
 GE junction, probably slightly distal to it.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, with possible slight interval
 improvement.  Retrocardiac opacities improved, though remains faintly present,
 with suggestion of air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Fixation hardware of the  lower cervical and upper thoracic spine again noted.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF, possibly very slightly improved compared with 1 day earlier.
 
 Residual left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though with interval
 improvement.
 
 NG tube tip over upper stomach.  The sideport lies near the GE junction,
 probably slightly distal to it.
