                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable with minimal atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the aortic
 knob.  Patchy opacities are seen within the left upper and lower lung fields
 which are nonspecific but may reflect areas of infection in the correct
 clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cervical
 spinal fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the left upper and lower lung fields are nonspecific, but
 may reflect infection in the correct clinical setting.  Repeat PA and lateral
 views of the chest with improved inspiratory effort may provide further
 clarification.
