                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?aspiration PNA  // please eval for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 04:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies 4.8 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip extends beneath the
 diaphragm off the film.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  This is more pronounced than on the prior study.  Allowing for
 technical differences, the retrocardiac opacity itself is unchanged, but there
 is some more patchy opacity at the left lung base likely related to this CHF. 
 Right cardiophrenic opacity appears slightly improved.
 
 Partially imaged cervical thoracic spine fixation hardware is noted, not fully
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening CHF.
 
 Patchy opacity at the left lung base laterally is more pronounced, but could
 relate to CHF.  Retrocardiac opacity itself is unchanged.  Slight interval
 improvement in patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic region.
