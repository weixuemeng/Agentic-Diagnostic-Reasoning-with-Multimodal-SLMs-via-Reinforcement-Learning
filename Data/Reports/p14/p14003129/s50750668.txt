                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast from ___.
 
 The well documented slowly growing pulmonary nodule/mass in the left lower
 lobe of the lung is not obvious on this conventional radiograph.  Some of the
 increased retrocardiac density may be secondary to the nodule, but most is
 atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation is identified to suggest pneumonia. 
 Increased density in the right hilum corresponds to known calcified lymph
 nodes.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Heart size is normal.
 
 As compared to coronal views of prior chest CT scans, longstanding elevation
 of the right lung base anteriorly could be increasing; it is due to severe
 local eventration of the hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process
