                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and questionable
 neutropenia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The known nodular opacity within the left lower lung is not as well
 demonstrated on this conventional radiograph.  There are no focal
 consolidations seen to suggest acute infectious process.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm that is likely related to eventration. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The heart is
 unchanged in size.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum below the
 diaphragms.  Mild degenerative change is present within the thoracic spine and
 there is mild-to-moderate degenerative change about the right
 acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Previously identified nodular
 density within the left lower lobe on prior CT is less well seen on the
 current conventional radiographs.
