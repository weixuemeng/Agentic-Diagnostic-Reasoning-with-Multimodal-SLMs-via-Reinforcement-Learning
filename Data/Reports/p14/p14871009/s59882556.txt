                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___ from as well as chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to poor positioning as well as the patient's body
 habitus. Allowing for these limitations:
 
 Compared with the previous exam there has been interval improvement of prior
 interstitial pulmonary edema as well as aeration of the left lower lobe. There
 is persistent prominence of the left hilum, likely a combination of a very
 tortuous aorta with an enlarged pulmonary artery, better demonstrated on prior
 CT. A small left-sided pleural effusion may be present although difficult to
 assess. There is no right-sided effusion. Significant rightward deviation of
 the trachea is also stable. A right femoral pacemaker is redemonstrated with
 leads in stable position. Assessment of cardiac size is limited although
 appears stable. Rotolevoscoliosis centered in the lower thoracic spine is also
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent left hilar engorgement may be related to superimposition of a
 tortuous aorta with an enlarged pulmonary artery. Superimposed perihilar
 consolidation cannot be completely excluded, however.
 
 2.  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe compared with radiograph from
 ___.
 
 3.  Unchanged rotolevoscoliosis and rightward deviation of the trachea.
