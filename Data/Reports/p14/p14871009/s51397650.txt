                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated transfer status post right IJ and OG tube, assess for
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube is at the
 level of the carina and should be withdrawn, 2-4 cm for more optimal
 positioning, despite kyphotic posture.  Nasogastric tube courses into the
 stomach.  Right IJ tip is not well seen as transvenous pacing wire passes
 through it, terminating over the right ventricular apex.  Lungs are low in
 volume with left basal atelectasis and possible effusion. Heart is moderately
 enlarged, carinal splaying indicates left atrial enlargement, and pulmonary
 arteries are enlarged. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous;
 evaluation for dissection or aneurysm would require CTS.  No pneumothorax.
 Also noted is a proximal right humeral fracture which is incompletely assessed
 and of uncertain age.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina and should be
 withdrawn 2-4 cm.
 2.  Low lung volumes with left basal atelectasis.  
 3.  Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous; evaluation for dissection
 or aneurysm would require CTS.
 4.  Moderate cardiomegaly, left atrial enlargement, and probable pulmonary
 hypertension.
 4.  Proximal right humeral fracture.
 
 Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at
 04:45 on ___, 2 minutes after discovery.
