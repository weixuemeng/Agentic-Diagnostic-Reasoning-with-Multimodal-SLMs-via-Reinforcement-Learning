                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for pneumonia or pulmonary
 congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with minimal
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification persists
 with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Pacer wires remain essentially unchanged.
 
 The opacification in the right upper zone medially persists.
