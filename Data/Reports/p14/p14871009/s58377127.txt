 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:02 PM
  Mild interstitial edema and possible small pleural effusions.  
  Unchanged R midlung discoid atelectasis.
  Persistent retrocardiac opacity could be atelectasis or infection.
  Mild-moderate cardiomegaly, exaggerated by pectus deformity.
  ETT remains low, retract 3 cm.
  L IJ line in same position, presumably at L BCV-SVC junction, with tip turned
  slightly superior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after cardiac arrest.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube is in
 the stomach.  The temporal pacemaker lead ends in the expected location of the
 right ventricle.  The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance,
 but there is interval progression of interstitial pulmonary edema, mild to
 moderate with bilateral small pleural effusions.  Left retrocardiac opacity
 might reflect effusion, although atelectasis or infection is another
 possibility.  The left internal jugular line tip is in unchanged position,
 most likely at the left brachiocephalic vein/SVC junction with tip turned
 slightly superior.
