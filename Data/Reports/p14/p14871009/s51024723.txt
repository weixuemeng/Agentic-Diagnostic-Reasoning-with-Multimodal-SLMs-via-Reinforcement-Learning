                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and fever after pacemaker
 placement.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no significant change in appearance of the chest compared
 with prior exam.  Lung volumes are low.  Medial right upper lobe and left
 perihilar and dense left base opacities are stable.  There is no right-sided
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Deviation of the trachea to the right is
 also unchanged and likely secondary to a prominent aortic arch.  Dual lead
 left sided pacemaker is stable in position.  A right sided PICC has been
 removed in the interval.
