                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, status post diuresis. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Current radiograph is dated ___
 timed at 8:09 a.m.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Even allowing for  projection, there may be some cardiomegaly.  There is
 unchanged thoracolumbar scoliosis.  There is heavy tracheobronchial
 calcification and some deviation of the trachea to the right side.  There is
 evidence of mild bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a patchy type of
 change in the right mid zone. Similar change in left mid zone is seen but the
 distribution of these is unchanged.  There is a left-sided central line noted.
 This demonstrates an unusual course, but its tip lies in the SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Little change from prior study.  Cardiomegaly with effusions and atelectasis.
