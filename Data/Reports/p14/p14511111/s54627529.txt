 appear within normal limits.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  There is a non-displaced
 left anterolateral ninth rib fracture with a visible step-off, possibly acute.
 However, non-displaced right ninth and tenth rib fractures show callus and
 probably subacute or older.
