                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP supine chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p arrest and now s/p aortic balloon pump  // Is
 balloon pump in place?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection, supine positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___ at 03:55.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of intra-aortic balloon pump, with
 radiopaque tip projecting over the descending aorta at the level of the left
 mainstem bronchus; this could be advanced forward approximately 3 cm for ideal
 positioning.
 
 The patient is now intubated, with distal tip of ET tube projecting below the
 level of the clavicles, approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  A right IJ
 central catheter is again seen with distal tip in stable position in the mid
 SVC.  The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are stable in appearance, with
 re-demonstrated cardiomegaly.
 
 There is improvement in the appearance of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is evidence of persistent probably small bilateral pleural effusions,
 posteriorly layering on the current film.  There is relaxation atelectasis of
 bilateral lower lobes as seen previously.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Intra-aortic balloon pump at the level of left mainstem bronchus.  Could
 be advanced 3 cm for ideal positioning.
 2.  Improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  Stable small bilateral
 pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:45.
