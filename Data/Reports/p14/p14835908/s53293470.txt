                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with flank pain  // ? infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Small opacification at the left
 base, which is concerning for pneumonia, appreciated on both frontal and
 lateral radiographs.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is new
 since ___, with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Configuration of the
 mediastinum at the thoracic inlet with undulation of the trachea could be due
 to tortuous vessels alone or possible contribution of enlarged right thyroid
 lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely left lower lobe pneumonia.  Suggest repeat chest radiograph electively
 to document clearing.  The region may need to be clarified with chest CT.
 
 Note: Abdomen CT performed 3 hr after this examination confirmed enlargement
 of probable pneumonia, left lower lobe, alternatively very large pulmonary
 infarct.  There is no pericardial effusion.
