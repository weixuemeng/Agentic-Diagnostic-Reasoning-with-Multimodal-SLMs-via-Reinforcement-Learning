                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with COPD, assess for lung lesions.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Deviation of the trachea
 towards the left is unchanged due to enlarged thyroid.  Loss of volume and
 scarring in the right upper lobe is minimally increased from prior.  Minimal
 interstitial peripheral abnormality in the lower lobes bilaterally is
 nonspecific, minimally increased from prior study.  There are no lung masses,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  Surgical clips project in the right upper
 hemithorax.
