                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple lung nodules, status post transbronchial biopsy of the
 right middle lobe nodule.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___ at 8:45
 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  Multiple scattered bilateral lung nodules are better
 evaluated on recent CT.  Mildly increased opacity in the right lower lung
 surrounding the nodule is compatible with postprocedural change from
 transbronchial biopsy.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  There
 is no pleural effusion or widening of the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild post-procedural changes in the right middle lobe from
 transbronchial biopsy without evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or
 effusion.
