                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, history of CHF, wheezing,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views have been obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is status post sternotomy and presence
 of multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinum are
 indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size is top normal, but no
 typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta unchanged with a
 few calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is unremarkable.  There may be a mild degree of upper zone
 redistribution pattern, but no evidence exists of interstitial alveolar edema.
 Small left-sided basal pleural thickening, unchanged and probably residual to
 previous cardiac surgery.  Otherwise, no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:Chest findings are stable.  No evidence of acute infiltrates.  Mild
 upper zone redistribution pattern suggests the possibility of some mild degree
 of CHF.
