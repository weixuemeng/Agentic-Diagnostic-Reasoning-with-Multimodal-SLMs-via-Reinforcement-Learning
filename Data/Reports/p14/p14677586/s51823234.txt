                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The patient is after median sternotomy due to CABG.  Heart size is enlarged. 
 Mediastinum is enlarged.  Widespread parenchymal opacities are noted
 bilaterally, most likely reflecting pulmonary edema.  Diffuse infection is
 less likely.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
