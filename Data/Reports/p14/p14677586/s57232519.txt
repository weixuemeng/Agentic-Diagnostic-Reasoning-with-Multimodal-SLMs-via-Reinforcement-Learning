                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dyspnea, nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Previously
 seen widespread parenchymal opacities have essentially resolved in the
 interval.  There is slight blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle
 suggesting a trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  Left base
 atelectasis is seen.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting the left costophrenic angle may be due to trace
 pleural effusion or pleural thickening, with overlying atelectasis.
