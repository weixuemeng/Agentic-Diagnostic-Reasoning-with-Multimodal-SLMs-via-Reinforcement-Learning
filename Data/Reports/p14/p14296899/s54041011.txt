                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New NG tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A newly placed NG tube terminates in the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes are low, which results in vascular crowding.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with a
 tortuous, calcified aorta.  There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Minimally
 dilated, air-filled loops of bowel are seen in the upper abdomen and are not
 fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory NG tube position.  
 2.  Minimally dilated loops of bowel are not fully evaluated and may reflect
 ileus from the patient's overlying pancreatitis.
