                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a new nodular focus
 projecting over the left costophrenic angle which is suspected to represent a
 nipple shadow or potentially a small focus of atelectasis given nodular
 character, however, followup PA view without and with nipple markers is
 recommended for confirmation.
