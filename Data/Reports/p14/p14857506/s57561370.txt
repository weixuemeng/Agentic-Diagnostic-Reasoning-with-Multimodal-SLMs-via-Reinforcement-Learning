                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low platelet count with shortness of breath and brown sputum, to
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the outside study of ___, there are
 substantially lower lung volumes, which may account for some of the increased
 prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is some fullness of
 pulmonary vessels, though again this could reflect low lung volumes or some
 mild element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Minimal atelectatic changes at the bases without evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.
