                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with failure to thrive, deconditioning,  history of
 congestive heart failure , recent motor vehicle accident// Acute pulmonary
 infection or CHF exacerbation?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, left shoulder radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Mild enlargement cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated with minimal atelectasis in the lung bases.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small right pleural effusion. 
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints are
 again noted.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  Chronic
 fracture deformity of the left humeral surgical neck is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
