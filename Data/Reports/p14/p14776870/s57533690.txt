                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of DVT/PE, CHF, AF and bradycardia s/p St.
 ___'s pacer, now admitted for CHF exacerbation. Complains of right chest wall
 pain.  // Assess for pulmonary edema and etiology of right chest wall pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without evidence of frank
 pulmonary edema.  The lungs are hyperinflated with fine interstitial lung
 markings at both lung bases, which may be due to emphysema or mild vascular
 congestion. Mild cardiomegaly is present. There is no pneumothorax. A
 dual-lead left pectoral pacemaker sends leads to the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The ascending aorta is dilated. Generalized osteopenia and
 multilevel loss of vertebral body height likely contribute to mild
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
