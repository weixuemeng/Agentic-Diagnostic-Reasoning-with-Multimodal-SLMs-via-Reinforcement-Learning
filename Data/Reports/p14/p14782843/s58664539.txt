                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe sleeve lobectomy
 procedure, with persistent moderate right apical pneumothorax and extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema predominantly in the right hemithorax. 
 Pneumomediastinum is also present. There remains a wedge-shaped opacity
 extending superiorly and laterally from the right hilum, possibly due to
 collapse of the right middle lobe, a finding that could be confirmed or
 further characterized by CT, which may also be helpful to exclude an
 anastomotic dehiscence in the setting of persistent pneumothorax and
 pneumomediastinum.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
