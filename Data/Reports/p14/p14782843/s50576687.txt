                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after mediastinoscopy and right upper lobe sleeve
 lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Over the past five days, the small right apical pneumothorax has decreased,
 but not resolved, A very small right pleural effusion is new or newly apparent
 since ___ and there is still severe subcutaneous emphysema in the right
 chest wall.  Mediastinum is midline and the heart is not enlarged.  Left lung
 is clear, chronically hyperinflated.
 
 Lateral view makes it difficult to say whether the right middle lobe is
 collapsed, or there is a fissural fluid collection in the upper aspect of the
 neofissure; whichever it is, the finding has been present without much change
 since surgery. Chest CT scanning would be definitive.
