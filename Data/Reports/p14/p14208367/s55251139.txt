                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate right upper pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate an increase in
 pleural fluid tracking along the major fissure on the right which may
 represent redistribution but a total increase in effusion is not excluded.  A
 small amount of pleural air persists at the right base next to a pleural
 drainage catheter.  Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis persist.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Redistribution of pleural fluid along the major fissure on the right, with
 possible overall increase in the extent of effusion.
 2.  Persistent pleural air adjacent to catheter.
 3.  Unchanged bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
