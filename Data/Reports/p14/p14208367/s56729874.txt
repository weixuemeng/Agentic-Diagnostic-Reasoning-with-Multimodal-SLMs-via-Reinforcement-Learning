                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall.  Question altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Again seen is a right-sided pleural effusion which
 partially tracks within the minor fissure.  Small left-sided effusion is now
 also seen.  There are increased parenchymal opacities, particularly at the
 right lung base more so than that at the left.  Surgical clips again seen at
 the thoracic inlet.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right-sided pleural effusion.  Small left pleural
 effusion.  Increased opacities at the lung bases particularly on the right
 likely due to superimposed infection given interval change since recent exam. 
 Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
