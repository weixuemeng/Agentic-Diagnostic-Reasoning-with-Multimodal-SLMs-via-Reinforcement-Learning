                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Patchy ill-defined opacities are noted
 within the upper lobes, right more so than left, which are nonspecific but may
 reflect areas of infection.  Mild perihilar haziness as well as small
 bilateral pleural effusions is compatible with mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacities in the upper lobes, more so on the right, may reflect areas
 of infection.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
