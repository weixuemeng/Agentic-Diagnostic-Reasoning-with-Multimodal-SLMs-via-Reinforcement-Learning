                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nausea after a house fire.  Rule out lung
 infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Aside from multiple calcified pulmonary granulomata, the lungs are clear. 
 Widening of the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet is longstanding, due to a
 combination of tortuous vessels and mediastinal fat deposition.  Mediastinal,
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 There is no evidence of bronchospasm, and no atelectasis or consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia or aspiration.
