                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L IJ port placement ___.  // ?change in
 pneumothorax and widening of mediastinum      ?change in pneumothorax and
 widening of mediastinum
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, no definite pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  No change in the appearance of the left IJ catheter.  The cardio
 mediastinal silhouette is stable.  Coarseness of interstitial markings with
 hyperexpansion of the lungs could well represent chronic pulmonary disease
 with basilar atelectatic changes.
