                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.  Readjustment. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change has
 occurred in the position of the slightly-malpositioned nasogastric tube.  At
 the level of the gastroesophageal junction, the tube is still kinked in the
 esophagus and requires repositioning.
 
 The appearance of the lungs and of the cardiac silhouette demonstrate no
 relevant change.
