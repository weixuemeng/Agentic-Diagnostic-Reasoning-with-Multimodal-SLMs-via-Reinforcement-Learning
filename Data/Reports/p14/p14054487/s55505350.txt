                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with nausea/syncope  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral view, there is subtle opacity projecting over the posterior
 lung base without definite correlate on the frontal view, possibly
 corresponding to the right basilar opacity. Findings may be due to atelectasis
 and overlapping structures although consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen. There is mild biapical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar opacity best seen on the lateral view may be due to atelectasis and
 overlap of structures, however, consolidation is not excluded. No pleural
 effusion.
