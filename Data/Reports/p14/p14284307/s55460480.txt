                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MM  // new fever and neutropenia, r/o PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable
 considering slightly lower lung volumes.  A new opacity is present in the left
 lung base obscures the periphery of the left hemidiaphragm and adjacent
 costophrenic sulcus.  Although potentially due to small pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis, developing infectious pneumonia should be considered in
 the setting of fever and neutropenia.  Right lung is clear except for a new
 patchy opacity at the right lung base.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 interval placement of right internal jugular catheter terminating in the lower
 superior vena cava, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
