                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall, pain / eval for bleed, fx, hemathrosis, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates increased opacity within the left
 lower lung zone with obscuration of the left heart border.  Patient is rotated
 to his left.  There appears to be probable central vascular congestion with
 probable mild pulmonary edema. The right costophrenic angle is clear.  No
 definite pleural effusion is seen on the lateral view.  A left chest heart
 device is in similar configuration relative to prior studies.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lung zone opacification for which etiology includes infectious
 process or alternatively sequela of aspiration.
 
 Increased perihilar opacities suggest central vascular congestion and mild
 pulmonary edema.
