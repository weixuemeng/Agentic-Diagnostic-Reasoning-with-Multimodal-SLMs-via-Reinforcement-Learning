 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Outside hospital radiographs
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 day ago.  Aortic knob is calcified.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. A right PICC ends in the proximal right atrium.  For positioning in the low
 superior vena cava retraction of 3 cm is recommended.
 2. Parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes
