                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a patchy opacity in the right lower lung, but dramatically
 decreased since the prior radiographs and perhaps a residual area of minor
 scarring associated with earlier infection.  Streaky opacities at the left
 base are minor and probably due to minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal basilar opacities, but probably due to atelectasis or
 scarring with no convincing evidence for pneumonia.
