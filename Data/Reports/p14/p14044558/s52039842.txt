                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent PICC placement at outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally.  A PICC
 ends in the right atrium at a level 8 cm below the carina. For placement
 within the superior vena cava the line would need to be withdrawn 4 cm. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Blunting of both the lateral and
 posterior pleural sulci could be due to either small effusions or,
 particularly on the right where there is pleural calcification, pleural
 scarring. Lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although line withdrawal of 2 cm was recommended to ___ line nurse, ___ by
 Dr. ___ at 1:20 on ___, 4 cm withdrawal would be more
 reliable to reposition the line in the low SVC.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions or pleural scarring, particularly on the
 right.
