                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure, s/p cardiac
 arrest  // Evaluate for infection      Evaluate for infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated and probably accounts for severe
 left lower lobe atelectasis, but aeration is worse today than it was in ___.  There may be a component of acute atelectasis or aspiration. 
 Radiographic follow-up advised.  Right upper lung is grossly clear.  Right
 infrahilar lung is mildly consolidated concerning for new pneumonia or recent
 aspiration.  Heart size top-normal.  No pleural abnormality.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a
 nasogastric drainage tube ends in the proximal stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is
 seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
