                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest  // Evaluate ETT placement,
 OGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available.  Comparison is made to CT of
 the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7.2 cm from the carina and can be
 advanced.  The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter
 projects over the upper SVC.  The tip of the gastric tube likely extends into
 the gastric body.  There is known elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as
 compared to the prior CT scan.  Increased opacities in the left mid to lower
 lung zone likely reflect intra-abdominal contents with associated atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
