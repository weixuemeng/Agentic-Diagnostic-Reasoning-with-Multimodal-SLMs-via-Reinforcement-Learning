 Severe hyperinflation reflects chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Vascular
 clips projecting over the breasts and hila denote prior surgery.  Aside from a
 tiny calcified granuloma seen on the lateral view lungs are clear of any focal
 abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  No lung nodules consolidation or evidence of cardiac
 decompensation is seen.
