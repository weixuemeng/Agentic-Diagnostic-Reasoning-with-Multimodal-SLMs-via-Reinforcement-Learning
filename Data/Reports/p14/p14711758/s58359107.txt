                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ as well as a chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, chest tightness and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the right
 mid-to-lower lung which could represent a nipple shadow.  Aside from this, the
 lungs are clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  The bony structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague nodular opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung is most
 likely a nipple shadow, though recommend repeat study with nipple markers to
 confirm.
