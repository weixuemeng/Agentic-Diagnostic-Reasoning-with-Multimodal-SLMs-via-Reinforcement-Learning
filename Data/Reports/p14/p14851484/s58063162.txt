                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 2 lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, stable in position. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is persistent obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm which may be due to a Bochdalek hernia as also seen on the
 prior study. No new focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural
 effusion although a trace right pleural effusion and is difficult to exclude
 as there is again blunting of the right costophrenic angle. No pneumothorax is
 seen. A VP shunt is noted coursing over the right hemi thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion. Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
