                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AVR/CABG  // eval for pneumothorax s/p chest
 tube removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple lines and tubes been removed.  A right IJ catheter overlies the
 proximal SVC.
 
 Possibility of a tiny left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  No other
 evidence a pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for lower lung volumes.
 
 Of note, there is hazy opacity at the right base which raises the possibility
 of some layering pleural fluid.  There is bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation which has progressed compared with the earlier study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 
 Lower inspiratory volumes with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation and
 equivocal small right effusion.  This appearance is notably worse compared
 with ___.
