 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of subtle patchy
 bibasilar opacities which could reflect patchy atelectasis, although bibasilar
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  Followup imaging would
 be advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient
 positioning between studies.  No pleural effusions.
