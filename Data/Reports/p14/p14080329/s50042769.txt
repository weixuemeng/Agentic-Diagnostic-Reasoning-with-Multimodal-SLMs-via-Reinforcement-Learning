  1.  Progression of triangular-shaped right lower lobe opacity is worrisome for
  right lower lobe collapse.
  2.  Bibasilar opacities with new small right pleural effusion is worrisome for
  bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Although less likely differential
  includes asymmetric pulmonary edema.
  2. Stable severe cardiomegaly with persistent mild pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, cp.  Assess for CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are moderately well inflated with mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 opacities seen on both frontal and lateral projection have increased since
 prior examination with a new right lower lung opacity appearing triangular in
 shape.  A new small right pleural effusion is present.  No left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Severe cardiomegaly is stable since prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Progression of triangular-shaped right lower lobe opacity is worrisome for
 right lower lobe collapse.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities with new small right pleural effusion is worrisome for
 bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.  Although less likely
 differential includes asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable severe cardiomegaly with persistent mild pulmonary edema.
