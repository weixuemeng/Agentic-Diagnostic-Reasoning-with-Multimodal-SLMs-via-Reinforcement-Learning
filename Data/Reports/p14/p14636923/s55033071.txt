                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer history with pleuritic chest pain.  Assess for
 pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a vague
 ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung which could represent patient's
 known reported malignancy.  Aside from this, the lungs appear clear.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms which could reflect
 underlying emphysema/COPD.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures
 are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill defined small focus of opacity in the right mid lung which
 per report could reflect a malignancy.  Please correlate clinically and with
 prior imaging as available.  If needed a CT may be obtained to further assess
 on a non-emergent basis.
