                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lactate of 4 and cough.  Please evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___ and
 chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Extensive fibrosis is again noted in the right lung,
 and there is interval increased opacification over the right middle and lower
 lobes, possibly reflective of worsening fibrosis though superimposed pneumonia
 or edema is not excluded.  Fibrotic changes are also noted along the left lung
 base.  There is a left cardiac device with its leads in stable position.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening right lung opacity may reflect progression of fibrosis though
 superimposed pneumonia or edema is not excluded.
