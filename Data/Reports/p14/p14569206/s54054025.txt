                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ 1,013.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 A 6 mm nodular density projecting over ___ left posterior rib is identified. 
 Previously a nodular density in the left lower lobe was also seen for which
 repeat radiographs with nipple markers were obtained.  That radiograph
 demonstrated no evidence of abnormality however I do not see the nodule
 clearly on that radiograph.   To confirm, a repeat radiograph with nipple
 markers can again be obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumonia.  Questionable 6 mm nodule.  Can repeat radiograph with nipple
 markers while the patient is in the emergency room to definitively conclude if
 this is an actual nodule.
