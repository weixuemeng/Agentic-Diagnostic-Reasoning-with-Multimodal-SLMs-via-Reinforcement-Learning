                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS decortication // Please evaluate for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left apical pneumothorax and small left pleural effusion have resolved.
 Focal    left upper pleural thickening is unchanged in comparison to the prior
 chest radiograph.  Nipple shadows bilaterally are not to be confused with
 pulmonary nodules, however  a subtle centimeter wide round opacity at the left
 lung base, projecting over the posterior tenth rib,   could be a pulmonary
 nodule.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours and 
 pulmonary vasculature are  normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Resolution of left apical pneumothorax and left pleural effusion.
 2.  Possible new left lung nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  For evaluation of possible left  lower lobe pulmonary
 nodule, recommend repeat chest x-ray in 3 months with PA, lateral, and shallow
 oblique views with nipple and skin markers on any skin lesions. Please request
 that the technologist  show images to a radiologist before patient leaves the
 department.
