                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with tobacco abuse, ethanol abuse and
 recently diagnosed pneumonia and new pulmonary edema.  Study requested for
 interval evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is prominence of the ascending
 aorta, unchanged from prior examinations.  Linear opacity at the left lung
 base has resolved.  There are no new focal consolidations.  Previously
 identified ___ mm left lung base nodular opacity is no longer identified, likely
 obscured by the nipple marker, suggesting it most likely represented a nipple
 shadow.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Osseous structures
 are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
