  1. Linear left basilar opacity, potentially due to atelectasis, however,
  superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
  2. 8mm left basilar nodular opacity, new from prior. Nonurgent repeat with
  nipple markers suggested as this could represent a nipple shadow.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacity identified at the left lung base
 partially obscuring the lateral costophrenic angle, this could be due to
 atelectasis, noting that superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the
 proper clinical setting.  Nodular opacity in the right mid lung is unchanged. 
 There is an 8mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base, not seen
 on prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Linear left basilar opacity, potentially due to atelectasis, however,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
 New 8mm left basilar nodular opacity, new from prior. Nonurgent repeat with
 nipple markers suggested as this could represent a nipple shadow.
