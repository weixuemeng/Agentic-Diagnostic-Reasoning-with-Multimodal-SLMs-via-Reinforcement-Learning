                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia, to assess for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No definite evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The left
 base is slightly more opaque than the right.  This could reflect small amount
 of pleural fluid with atelectatic changes or even possible consolidation,
 though it also may be a manifestation of overlying soft tissues.  If the
 condition of the patient would permit, a lateral view would be most helpful.
