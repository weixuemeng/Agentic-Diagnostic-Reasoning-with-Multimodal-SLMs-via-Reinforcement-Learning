  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.1 cm above the carina. There are worsening
  bilateral parenchymal opacities, compatible with severe pulmonary edema. A
  small to moderate pleural effusion is likely unchanged accounting for
  differences in positioning. There has been some re-expansion of the middle
  lobe.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation  // ET tube placement. RLL
 collapse?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was intubated.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube is projecting 5 cm above the carinal. The course of the
 previous left PICC line is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. There is
 evidence of increasing pulmonary edema that is now severe.  Unchanged evidence
 of a retrocardiac atelectasis as well as of a right pleural effusion with
 subsequent basal atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
