 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath and suspected pulmonary edema due

 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT
 torso obtained on ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged.  Prominence of pulmonary arteries is
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  The lungs are essentially clear
 except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no appreciable pulmonary
 edema seen and only mild vascular engorgement might be noted in the upper lung
 zones.  There is no pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
