                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and new oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrates persistent mildly enlarged
 heart size, unchanged since the prior.  The lungs are well expanded with no
 evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion or overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 streaky opacity in the right lung base is likely representative of a summation
 of vessels or minor atelectasis.  No focal pneumonia is identified.  Clips are
 again seen within the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
