                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior study.  The
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary edema with
 perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are also demonstrated.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases.  No pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities grossly seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary
 edema along with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.
