                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of asbestos exposure and known
 pleural plaques, here to assess for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show appropriate
 inspiratory lung volumes.  Multiple ill-defined opacities corresponding to
 known pleural plaques are not appreciably changed from ___ with
 predominance in the right hemithorax and diaphragm consistent with asbestos
 pleural disease.  The lungs are clear without pleural effusions, pneumothorax,
 or focal consolidation.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits and unchanged from the preceding radiograph.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable asbestos pleural disease.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
