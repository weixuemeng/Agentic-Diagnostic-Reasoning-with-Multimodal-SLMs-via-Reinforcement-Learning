                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to prior studies.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures could potentially account for apparent hazy
 areas of opacity in the perihilar regions with loss of sharpness of vessels. 
 No confluent areas of consolidation are observed, and there are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No segmental or lobar areas of consolidation to suggest a bacterial
 pneumonia.
 2.  Questionable hazy perihilar opacities, possibly due to crowding of
 bronchovascular structures related to slightly reduced lung volumes.  Viral
 pneumonia is an additional possibility in the appropriate clinical setting.
