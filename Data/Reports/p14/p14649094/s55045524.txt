                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or an acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is rotated.  There is a vague, increased opacity of the
 right lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Vague, increased opacity within the right lower lobe may reflect
 atelectasis, although, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
