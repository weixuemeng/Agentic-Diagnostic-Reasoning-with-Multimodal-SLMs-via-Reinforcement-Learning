 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube removal, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___ p.m.
 
 Compared to the earlier film, ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  Again
 seen is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, tip overlying the main pulmonary
 artery, unchanged.  Also again seen is a small left effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  The effusion has decreased in size.  Doubt
 CHF.  No other focal infiltrate.  No right-sided effusion identified.  No
 pneumothorax detected.  Sternotomy wires noted. Surgical ___ noted over
 left neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of ET tube and NG tube.  Small left effusion and
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation appears improved.
