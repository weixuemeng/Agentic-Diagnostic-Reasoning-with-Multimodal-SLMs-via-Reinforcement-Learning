                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic breast cancer, now with
 neutropenic fever and pneumonia saturating to the 80s.  Evaluate for evidence
 of fluid overload versus worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___ and chest radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities
 in a perihilar distribution are noted, right worse than left.  No discrete
 focal opacities are observed.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable
 otherwise.  Multiple dense nodularities in the mediastinum correspond to known
 calcified nodal masses.  The aortic knob is heavily calcified.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The pleural sulci are not
 opacified bilaterally, but the patient is known to have small bilteral pleural
 effusions from prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION  Pulmonary edema not significantly changed compared with prior CT
 performed approximately 24 hours prior to this exam.  No new discrete focal
 opacities concerning for overlapping inflammatory process.
