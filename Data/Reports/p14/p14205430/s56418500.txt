                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with prostate cancer,
 metastatic disease to bone and palliative radiotherapy to left hip, with
 febrile neutropenia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Extensive hilar calcified lymphadenopathy is unchanged.  Lungs are overall
 clear with no evidence of consolidation to suggest interval development of
 infectious process.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 If clinically warranted, evaluation with chest CT to exclude the possibility
 of radiographically occult infectious process might be considered.
