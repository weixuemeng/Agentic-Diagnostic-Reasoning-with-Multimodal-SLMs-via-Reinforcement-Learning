                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Linear bibasilar opacities are
 compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.  Mild loss of height anteriorly of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is noted.  No displaced fractures are seen within the ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mild loss of height anteriorly of a mid thoracic vertebral body, age
 indeterminate.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.  If there is continued
 clinical concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
