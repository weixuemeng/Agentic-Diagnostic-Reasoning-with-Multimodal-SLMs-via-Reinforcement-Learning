                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new right IJ line.  Evaluate line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes account for bronchovascular crowding; however mild
 fluid overload would be difficult to exclude. No focal opacities are
 identified. Cardiac size is in the upper limits of normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A new right IJ line ends in the lower
 SVC/cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased vascular markings may be due to mild fluid overload
 although assessment is limited due to low lung volumes.  New right IJ line
 ends in the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction.
