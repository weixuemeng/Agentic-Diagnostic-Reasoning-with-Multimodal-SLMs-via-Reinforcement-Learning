                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bilateral upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged with somewhat globular configuration, which may be due
 to pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen, although a small
 retrocardiac consolidation is difficult to exclude.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The superior mediastinum remains prominent as it did on the
 prior study from ___.  There is mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring, best
 seen on the lateral view.  The posterior costophrenic angles are not well seen
 which may be due to overlying soft tissue, though trace pleural effusions are
 not excluded.
