                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with picc line in LUE pls eval placement of picc and
 pacemaker  // History: ___F with picc line in LUE pls eval placement of picc
 and pacemaker
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single lead right-sided pacer device is stable in position.  There is a
 left-sided PICC which terminates at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right
 atrium, as seen on prior study.  Again, this could be pulled back 3-4 cm.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There
 is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Pleural
 fluid appears decreased in amount as compared to the prior study, although
 this may relate to differences in patient position.  Left pleural effusion has
 essentially resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion appears decreased since the prior study. 
 Essentially resolved left pleural effusion.
 
 Right PICC continues to terminate in mean proximal right atrium an again,
 could be pulled back 3-4 cm.
