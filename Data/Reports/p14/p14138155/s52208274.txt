                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ETT, status post transfer, confirm
 proper placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next previous
 available transferred chest examination dated ___.  The time interval
 is about five hours.  Previous examination is indicated as supine position and
 the tip of the ETT is rather low terminating close to the level of the carina
 by less than 2-cm distance.  The present examination, which is obtained in
 semi-upright position confirms again the low position of the ETT barely 2 cm
 above the carina.  Adjustment is recommended and place it about 3-4 cm higher
 up.  On the present chest examination, there is no evidence of pneumothorax in
 the apical area.  High positioned diaphragms are observed and probably related
 to an abdominal condition with markedly gas distended large bowel and stomach.
 There is no evidence of significant pleural effusion on this single view and
 no acute new infiltrates can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Adjust ETT position as indicated.  ___ was paged at
 5:40 p.m.  The page number was ___.
