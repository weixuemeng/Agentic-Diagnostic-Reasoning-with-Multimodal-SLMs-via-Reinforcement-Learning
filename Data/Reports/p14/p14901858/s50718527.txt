                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with reactive pleural effusion ___ LUQ infected
 hematoma  // Please assess L pleural effusion for change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lung is fully expanded and clear.  Focal opacity adjacent to a left
 pigtail drainage catheter is new, possibly focal hematoma or loculated
 effusion.  A large left pleural effusion with associated lower lobe relaxation
 atelectasis is improved compared to 2 days prior, unchanged compared 1 day
 prior.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Visualized cardiomediastinal
 hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Additional drainage catheters project of
 the left upper quadrant.  Intravascular embolic material projects over the
 left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New focal opacity adjacent to the coiled pigtail catheter may reflect
 hematoma were loculated effusion.  Attention on follow-up.
 2. Large dependent left pleural effusion is unchanged.
