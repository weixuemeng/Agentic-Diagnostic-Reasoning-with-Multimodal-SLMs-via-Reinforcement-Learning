 IMPRESSION:

 NOTIFICATION:   And the CT study of that date, there is again a large
 partially loculated left pleural effusion extending superiorly to involve the
 apex.  The change in appearance most likely reflects merely the supine AP
 projection rather than the previous PA erect position of the patient.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 Overall, lower lung volumes.  The right lung remains clear.
