                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  malaise, HD patient, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There has been interval
 placement of a right IJ dialysis catheter with its tip residing at the low SVC
 level. Mild hazy opacity at the left lung base is most compatible with
 atelectasis though an early pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the correct
 clinical setting. Otherwise the lungs appear clear. No definite sign of
 effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours appear stable and
 normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity likely represents atelectasis though an early pneumonia is
 impossible to exclude.  Dialysis catheter appears positioned appropriately.
