                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post bypass surgery, evaluate for
 pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable post-operative chest examination of ___.  Status post
 sternotomy.  Post-operative moderate cardiac enlargement persists.  Multiple
 surgical clips identified in anterior left side mediastinum indicative of
 recent bypass surgery.  Bilateral plate atelectasis is again seen and similar
 to what has been shown on the frontal view of the portable examination of
 ___.  These atelectases are located mostly in the dorsal lobe areas. 
 There is probably some mild degree of pleural effusion as the left-sided
 posterior pleural sinus cannot be identified.  Visibility of the right-sided
 posterior pleural sinus excludes, however, any free pleural effusion on that
 side.  A right internal jugular approach central venous line is still present
 and seen to terminate overlying the right mediastinal structures at level 2 cm
 below the carina.  Position is unchanged.  No pneumothorax seen in the apical
 area.  Comparison is extended to the most recent pre-operative chest
 examination which is dated ___.  It is noted that the
 pre-operative chest examination demonstrated a normal heart size.  The present
 enlargement of the heart silhouette is consistent with post-operative findings
 which may be caused by post-operative pericardial clots and bleedings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral basal atelectasis post-operatively.  Only
 minor pleural fluid is seen on left base.  No new parenchymal abnormalities
 and no marked congestion in the pulmonary venous circulation.
