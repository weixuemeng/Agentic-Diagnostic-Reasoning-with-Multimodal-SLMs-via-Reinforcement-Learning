                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, known CAD and prior CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart is normal
 size, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Lung volumes are low,
 and left basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis; however, developing
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  The right lung is clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes with increased retrocardiac opacification,
 likely from atelectasis; however, developing consolidation cannot be excluded.
