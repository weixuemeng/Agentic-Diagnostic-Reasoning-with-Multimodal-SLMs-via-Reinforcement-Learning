                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post bypass surgery, evaluate for
 infiltrates.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  There is status post sternotomy and previous
 bypass surgery as before.  Heart size is unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  As on previous examination, there persists bilateral plate
 atelectasis on the lung bases; however, the inspiration effort was much more
 successful identifying clear diaphragmatic contours and free lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses.  No new acute pulmonary infiltrates can be
 identified and the lateral view discloses also that the posterior pleural
 sinuses do not contain any significant pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked post-operative improvement of  inspirational effort with
 regressing plate bilateral atelectasis.  No new infiltrates or pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.
