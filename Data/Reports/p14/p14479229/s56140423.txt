                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been removal of all of
 the monitoring and support devices except for the right IJ catheter, which
 extends to lower portion of the SVC.  Specifically, following chest tube
 removal there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Relatively low lung volumes may account for some of the apparent engorgement
 of pulmonary vessels and bibasilar atelectatic change with probable small
 pleural effusions.
