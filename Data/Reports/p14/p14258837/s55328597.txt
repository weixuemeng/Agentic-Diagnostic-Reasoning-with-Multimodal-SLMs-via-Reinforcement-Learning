  1. Faint bibasilar opacities, greater on the left than the right, which are
  likely representative of atelectasis; however, pneumonia/aspiration must be
  excluded in the proper clinical setting. Small left pleural effusion is likely
  present.
  2. Moderate cardiomegaly and prominent tortuous aorta.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  TIA, to look for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimal bibasilar opacities is probably atelectasis.  Left posterior and
 lateral costophrenic angle is blunted, and it mostly chronic scarring, and
 unlikely effusion.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is top normal.
