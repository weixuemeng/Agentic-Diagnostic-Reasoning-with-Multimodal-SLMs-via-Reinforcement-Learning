                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with crackles on left side.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a fan-shaped opacity in the apical posterior segment of
 the right upper lobe suspicious for pneumonia.  There are no other areas of
 focal consolidation or opacities.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The heart is borderline normal in size.  The aorta is mildly
 calcified.  The mediastinum appears widened with a right thoracic inlet mass
 seen impinging and slightly compressing the trachea.  Finding most likely
 represents an enlarged thyroid.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine
 are seen.  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right apical/posterior upper lobe pneumonia.  Followup six weeks after
 treatment is recommended.
 2.  Right-sided thoracic inlet mass, most likely thyroid enlargement,
 compressing trachea.  Please correlate clinically and consider followup study
 with ultrasound.
 
 These findings were relayed to Dr. ___ ___ phone at 10:57 a.m. by ___
