                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with choledocholithiasis, s/p FFP infusion with
 SOB, wheeze  // acute process      acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is
 little change.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is mild
 tortuosity of the descending aorta.  Some prominence of the ascending aorta
 raises the possibility of underlying hypertension.
 No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  There is mild
 asymmetry of opacification in the left infrahilar region.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could reflect developing consolidation.
