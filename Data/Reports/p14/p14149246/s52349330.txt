                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and low-grade temperature.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again there is flattening of the hemidiaphragmatic contour with
 blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right.  This most likely reflects
 pleural thickening related to prior effusion or infection.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
