                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:18 P.M., ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Despite pulmonary hyperinflation suggesting a substantial COPD, pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged, suggesting that mild interstitial abnormality is
 edema due to cardiac decompensation.  Nevertheless heart size is normal and
 mediastinal veins are not engorged.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not
 dilated.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
