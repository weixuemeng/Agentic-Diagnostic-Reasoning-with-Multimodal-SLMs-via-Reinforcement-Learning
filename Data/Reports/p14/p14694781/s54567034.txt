                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with no PMH with new chest pressure/dyspnea on
 exertion  // pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear. On the frontal view cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. The only abnormality is
 seen on the lateral view where there is thickening of the retrosternal soft
 tissue at the level of the sternal body. Although this could be due to an
 unusually prominent traversus thoracis muscle, this is also the appearance of
 internal mammary adenopathy. Because the hilar and other mediastinal contours
 are normal, I would not say that there is extensive intra thoracic adenopathy,
 but it would be reasonable to examine the patient for adenopathy elsewhere,
 and if symptoms persist, to evaluate this abnormality with a repeat chest
 radiograph in several weeks and if the findings persist, follow with a chest
 scan.
 
 Thoracolumbar scoliosis is minimal.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Pertinent critical findings were entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 08:46 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
