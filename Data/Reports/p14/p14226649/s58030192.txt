 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pancreatic cancer who has new productive
 cough  // pneumonia?      pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification
 at the left base, most likely consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.  Less prominent atelectatic changes and probable small
 effusion on the right.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 The upper lungs are clear and there is little change in the appearance of the
 Port-A-Cath.
