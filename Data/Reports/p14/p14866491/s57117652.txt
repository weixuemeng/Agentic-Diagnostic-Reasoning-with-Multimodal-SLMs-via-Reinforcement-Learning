                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDIGNS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate lower lobe streaky
 opacities seen best on the lateral view, though not well localized on the
 frontal view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely lower lobe atelectasis seen best on the lateral view. 
 Pneumonia cannot be excluded though, and clinical correlation is recommended.
