                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea, CA, worsening dyspnea.  Evaluate
 size of pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pleural effusion is moderate to large with associated compressive
 atelectasis and collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.  The left
 pleural effusion is small, also with associated compressive atelectasis and
 left lower lobe collapse.  Remaining aerated lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart
 size is not well assessed in the presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Widening of the thoracic spine is similar to the prior exam
 with mild retrolisthesis of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large right and small left pleural effusions with associated
 substantial volume loss.
