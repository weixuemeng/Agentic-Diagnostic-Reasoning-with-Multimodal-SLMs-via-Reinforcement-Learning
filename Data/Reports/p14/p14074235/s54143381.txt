 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  GI bleed, check ET tube.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.4 cm above the carina.  Right PICC line is in similar
 location.  The right IJ cordis has a kink in the soft tissues, with tip in
 SVC. There are new bilateral alveolar infiltrates upper lobe greater than
 lower lobe.  There continues to be mild cardiomegaly.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is indistinct.  The overall impression is that of acute pulmonary
 edema given the rapid change in appearance compared to the study from one hour
 prior.
