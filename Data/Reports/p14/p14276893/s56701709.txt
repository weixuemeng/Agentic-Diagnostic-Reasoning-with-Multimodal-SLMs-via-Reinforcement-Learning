                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 15:40 p.m., the left-sided chest tube has been
 removed.  The ET tube, NG tube and Swan-Ganz catheter have also been removed,
 as has a mediastinal drain.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  Sternotomy
 wires again noted.  There is decreased pulmonary vascular plethora and
 interstitial marking, consistent with markedly improved CHF findings.  There
 is patchy opacity at the left base, unchanged, with possible minimal blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle. PLatelike atelectasis noted in left mid zone.
 There is a small right effusion and opacity at the right base which is
 new/progressed compared with the earlier film.  Possible soft tissue swelling
 in left supraclavicular area.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of tubes and lines.  No pneumothorax identified.
 2.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.  Possible small
 left effusion.
 4.  New or progressed small right effusion and right base opacity --
 ? atelectasis, though the possibility of an early area of consolidation cannot
 be entirely excluded.
 5.  Interval resolution of CHF findings.  Possible minimal residual upper zone
 redistribution.
