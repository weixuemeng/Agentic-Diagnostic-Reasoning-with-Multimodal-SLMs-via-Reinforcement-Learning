                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two images of the chest show bilateral small pleural effusions,
 slightly greater on the right than the left.  There has been a slight decrease
 in the haziness at the right base suggesting that the right pleural effusion
 has decreased in size.  There is a small amount of fluid seen within the left
 major fissure.  There are no pulmonary consolidations.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There are
 sternotomy wires in place.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  The right pleural effusion
 seems to have slightly decreased in size from the prior radiograph.
