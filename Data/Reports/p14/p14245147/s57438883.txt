                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, after pigtail placement, complains of pain at tube
 site.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right pleural effusion, which decreased substantially with the insertion of
 the pigtail drainage catheter on ___, reaccumulated to some extent on ___ and has remained subsequently stable.  Interim cardiac decompensation has
 improved, probably accounting for the decrease in edema in the right lung,
 which is still substantially atelectatic at the base.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is longstanding.  No subcutaneous emphysema and no
 pneumothorax.
