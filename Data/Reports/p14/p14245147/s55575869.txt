                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:41 PM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion drained by pigtail catheter. 
 Pain at the tube site.  Has the tube unchanged in position?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been very little change in the position of the right pleural tube at
 the base of the right hemithorax, as far as one can tell on a single frontal
 view alone.  On ___, when the lateral view was performed, there was
 approximately 12 cm of tubing in the chest, lying mostly lateral to the base
 of the right lung.  There does not seem to have been appreciable migration
 since then.  This examination provides no information about soft tissues, for
 example, whether there is intra- or submuscular fluid collection.  The volume
 of right pleural effusion, which increased between ___ and ___, has
 subsequently decreased.  Definitive information about the tube and state of
 the pleural space would require CT scanning, when such information is
 clinically required.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, stable.  Left lung shows mild vascular congestion,
 suggesting that there is a cardiac component to edema in the right lower lung.
 There is no pneumothorax.
