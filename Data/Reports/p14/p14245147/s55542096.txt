                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  B-cell lymphoma with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly,
 unchanged since ___.  There is increased central vascular
 congestion with interstitial edema.  Right base opacity which may be due to
 consolidation and/or moderate-sized right pleural effusion is unchanged, with
 adjacent compressive atelectasis.  Increased density at the right lung base
 may reflect worsening atelectasis, although an evolving consolidation cannot
 be excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Right base opacity which may be due to consolidation and/or moderate-sized
 right pleural effusion is unchanged, with adjacent compressive atelectasis
 3.  Central vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema, new since
