                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following right thoracentesis, a right pleural effusion has
 slightly decreased in size, and there is no visible pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, and there is persistent mediastinal widening due
 to known lymphadenopathy on recent CT.  New confluent opacity in the right
 perihilar region likely represents asymmetrical edema and less likely
 aspiration or pneumonia.  Unchanged right lower lobe opacity, better
 characterized on recent CT.  New patchy left lower lobe opacity is likely due
 to atelectasis and is accompanied by small pleural effusion.
