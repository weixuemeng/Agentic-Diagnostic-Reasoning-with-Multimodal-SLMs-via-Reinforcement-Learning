                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary B-cell lymphoma and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged, due to cardiomegaly
 and possible pericardial effusion.  Vascular congestion is mild. 
 Consolidation with air bronchograms in the right lower lung could be
 asymmetric edema with atelectasis, but should be considered pneumonia until
 proved otherwise. Some of the small to moderate right pleural effusion tracks
 upward along the lateral costal pleural surface.  The left lung is clear and
 there is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable right lower basal pneumonia.
 2.  Right pleural effusion.
 3.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and marked vascular engorgement due to cardiac
 decompensation; pericardial effusion could be present also.
 
 Results were telephoned to Dr. ___ at 1:05 p.m. on ___ by Dr. ___.
