                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is substantially enlarged.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery
 is consistent with enlarged pulmonary artery seen on the prior radiograph. 
 Right lower lobe consolidation has additionally increased in the interim and
 most likely now associated with pleural effusion.  Elevated hemidiaphragm
 cannot be entirely excluded.  The upper lungs are essentially clear except for
 left lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.
