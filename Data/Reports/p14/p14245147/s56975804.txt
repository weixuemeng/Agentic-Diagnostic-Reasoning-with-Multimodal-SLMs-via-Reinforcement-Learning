 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:53 PM
  1.  Right base opacity which may be due to consolidation and/or moderate-sized
  right pleural effusion is unchanged, with adjacent compressive atelectasis
  appears stable to slightly increased compared to the prior.
  2.  Central vascular congestion with  interstitial edema appears mildly
  increased compared to the prior exam.
  3. Moderate cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, pulmonary hypertension, ascites
 and known right lower lobe consolidation, evaluate for acute pulmonary edema
 as the patient is now hypoxic.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 Comparison is also made to a reference chest image dated ___ as well as
 to selected images from a chest CTA performed on ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged but unchanged since ___ which would favor
 cardiomegaly rather than a pericardial effusion.  Overall, the right lung is
 lower in volume than the left and there is more focal basilar airspace
 consolidation and right lateral pleural thickening, much of which appears to
 have been present in ___, although the overall lung volume is slightly less
 since ___. A diffuse interstitial abnormality is more prominent on the right
 side when compared to the left which raises the possibility of an underlying
 interstitial abnormality in patient with a history of B-cell lymphoma.  An
 element of pulmonary fibrosis cannot be entirely excluded.  In addition,
 however, the interstitium appears slightly less defined when compared to the
 most recent plain film study of ___ which suggests possible superimposed
 interstitial edema at this time.  Focal airspace consolidation at the right
 lung base is stable but raises the possibility of aspiration, pneumonia as
 well as a more chronic process with evidence of a loculated effusion on the
 recent CT study of ___.  Possibility of lymphangitic involvement of the
 interstitium with lymphoma given the presence of the mediastinal and axillary
 lymphadenopathy on the recent CT study should also be considered.  No
 pneumothorax.
