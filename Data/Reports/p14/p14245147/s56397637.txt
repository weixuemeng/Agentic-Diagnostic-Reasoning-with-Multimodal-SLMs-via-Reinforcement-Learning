 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of lymphoma and right empyema.  New
 dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The volume of pleural fluid at the base of the right hemithorax, has increased
 since ___.  Tiny collection of pleural air is essentially unchanged.  The
 volume of consolidation at the base of the right lung difficult to assess may
 have increased, raising the possibility of recurrent pneumonia.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement and borderline cephalization
 of pulmonary blood flow are all stable, but there is no pulmonary edema or
 left pleural effusion to indicate acute cardiac decompensation.
