                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fall from height with significant
 pulmonary contusion (right) and hemopneumothorax  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Again seen is asymmetrical opacification of the right
 lung base, which appears slightly worse than the ___ radiograph.
 However, it is difficult to assess if this has changed since the last CT
 chest. There is a small right apical pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are within normal limits.The right distal clavicular fracture is unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Right lung base opacity that appears slightly worse compared to the ___ CXR.  This is likely pulmonary hemorrhage versus known hemothorax.
