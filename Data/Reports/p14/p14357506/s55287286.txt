 INDICATION:  ___M with RCC mets p/w confusion and FTT, dec breath sounds,
 evaluate for signs of pneumonia, change in pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in patient positioning, the right pleural effusion is
 not significantly changed.  Increased airspace opacity at the right lung base
 may represent a superimposed infectious process or relaxation atelectasis. 
 There is no left-sided pleural effusion. Multiple rounded parenchymal
 opacities are consistent with patient's known pulmonary nodules. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased airspace opacity in the right lung base may represent developing
 pneumonia or atelectasis related to the unchanged moderate right pleural
