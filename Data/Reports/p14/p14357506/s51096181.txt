                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube removal with pleurex remaining  //
 c/f PNA, recurrent pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs from ___.  CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chest tube overlies the base of the right lung as before.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity at the right base which
 may reflect atelectasis or infection, minimally increased from prior. 
 Multiple rounded opacities throughout both lungs are consistent with known
 pulmonary nodules, better appreciated on recent CT.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall similar to prior with minimal increase in right lower lung opacity.
