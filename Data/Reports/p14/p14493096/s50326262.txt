                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Subtle opacity in the
 left lower lung could represent atelectasis versus an early pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Right lung is
 clear.  Heart size appears grossly within normal limits.  The mediastinal
 contour is unchanged with slightly unfolded thoracic aorta.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the left lung base is concerning for atelectasis versus an
 early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
