                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukemia with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased
 opacification at the bases is somewhat more prominent.  It is unclear whether
 some of this could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  However, on
 the left, the opacification appears to be more prominent than previously with
 a slightly poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with the
 parenchymal opacity seen on prior CT.
