                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is probably normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Basilar opacities are slight and probably
 related to minor atelectasis.  There is no evidence for free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No free air identified.  Low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar
 opacities, most suggestive of minor atelectasis.
