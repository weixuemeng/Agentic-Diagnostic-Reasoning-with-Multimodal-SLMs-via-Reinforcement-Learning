                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSCLC and recurrent pleural effusion
 presenting with dypsnea found to have loculated pleural effusion s/p CT
 placement.  Evaluate change in effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pleural catheter again terminates over the left lower lung.  Right
 pleural effusion is small, improved from the prior study.  Degree of
 opacification of the right lower lobe is improved.  Left lower lobe
 demonstrates mild linear atelectasis but is otherwise clear.  Heart size
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Small right apical pneumothorax is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion and improved aeration of
 the right lower lobe.
 Stable small right apical pneumothorax.
