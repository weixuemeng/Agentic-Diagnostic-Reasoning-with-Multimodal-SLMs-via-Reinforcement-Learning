                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ lung ca w/ acute SOB  // evaluate for PTX vs worsening
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a combination of
 pleural fluid and consolidation as seen on the prior CT.  Apical pleural fluid
 is also noted.  The extent of airspace opacity/ consolidation is slightly
 improved compared to the earlier chest radiograph.  The left lung appears
 grossly clear.  No pneumothorax seen.  The visualized bony structures are
 unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of a right pleural effusion and right lower lobe
 consolidation.
