                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stage 4 lung cancer // Monitor PTX and
 chest tube s/p talc. Request CXR to be done at 6am on ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pigtail catheter in similar position.  Interval worsening of the
 asymmetric right upper lobe opacity.  The moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion has not significantly changed.  There is a small apical right
 pneumothorax, also stable mm. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is suspected.
 A moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening asymmetric right upper lobe airspace opacity can be
 worsening edema versus infection.
 
 Moderate right-sided pleural effusion and small apical pneumothorax are
 stable.
 
 There has been no change in the position of the right pigtail pleural drain
 which projects over the right mid chest. Consideration should be given to the
 possibility that the tube is fissural, particularly if the tube is
 malfunctioning.
