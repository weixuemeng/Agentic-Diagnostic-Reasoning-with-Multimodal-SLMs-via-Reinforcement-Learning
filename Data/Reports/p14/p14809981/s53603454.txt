                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.  Small right apical
 pneumothorax is unchanged in size.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion
 with a volume loss in the right lower lobe, and also probably the right middle
 lobe.  Heart and mediastinum are also unchanged.  Bibasilar consolidations are
 similar in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Right-sided pleural effusion and volume loss in the right lower lobe, and
 possibly the right middle lobe.  Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
