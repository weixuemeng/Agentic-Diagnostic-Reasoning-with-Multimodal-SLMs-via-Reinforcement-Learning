                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There are linear opacities at the lung
 bases pain laterally, these could potentially be due to atelectasis given the
 relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles, left more
 so than right and could potentially be technical in nature due to overlying
 soft tissues.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis given the low lung volumes
 however superimposed pneumonia is not completely excluded.  If the patient is
 amenable, PA and lateral views may offer additional detail.
