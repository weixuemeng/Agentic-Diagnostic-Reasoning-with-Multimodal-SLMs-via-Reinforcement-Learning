                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of severe emphysema, volume overload
 // interval change volume
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the radiograph obtained approximately 8 hours prior, lung volumes
 are lower.  Opacification of the left hemithorax has increased, possibly
 positional given exaggerated lordotic view.  Multiple bulla are now better
 appreciated, the largest of which located at the left lung apex. The right
 hemithorax opacities are essentially unchanged, likely a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural fluid.  Prior right rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left hemithorax opacification may be related to exaggerated lordotic
 view.  Concurrent pneumonia is possible.
