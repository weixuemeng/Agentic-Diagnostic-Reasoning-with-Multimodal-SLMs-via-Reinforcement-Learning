                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post Bentall procedure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval increase in lung volume bilaterally with
 improvement in aeration.  There is improved persistent left lower lobe
 atelectasis with a small amount of adjacent pleural effusion.  There are no
 areas of focal consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is comparable to preoperative appearance. 
 Median sternotomy wires are seen in alignment with no evidence of failure. 
 There is a retroxiphoid gas collection which may be infiltrating the
 mediastinal fat, however, this is not typical in appearance and should be
 evaluated clinically to detect infection.  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  
 2) Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved, but persists with a small amount
 of adjacent pleural effusion.  
 3) Cardiomegaly is comparable to preoperative appearance.  
 4) There is an admix of soft tissue and gas which may represent air
 infiltrating the mediastinal fat, however, infection cannot be ruled out. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 These findings were discussed with nurse ___ ___ via phone by
 ___ at 1:35 p.m.
