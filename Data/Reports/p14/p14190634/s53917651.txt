  Linear left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis. Possible trace bilateral
  effusions.

  Mild edema is resolved in comparison to prior study. Residual lingular
  consolidation likely represents atelectasis but pulmonary infarct or pneumonia
  cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ ___ 10:15 PM
  1. Mild edema is resolved in comparison to prior study. Residual lingular
  consolidation likely represents atelectasis but pulmonary infarct or pneumonia
  cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
  2.  Multiple moderate to severe compression deformities in the mid to lower
  thoracic spine, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with HTN  // ?PE?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest re- of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is within normal limits.  Left base linear opacity likely
 represents atelectasis.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions with
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles.  Old left lateral rib fractures
 as well as mid thoracic and mid lumbar compression deformities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  Possible trace bilateral
 effusions.
