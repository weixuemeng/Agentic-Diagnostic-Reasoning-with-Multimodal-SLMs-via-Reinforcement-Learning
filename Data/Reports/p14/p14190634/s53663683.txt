                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  eval ptx-CT clamped
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The left apex is partially obscured by an overlying
 drape and monitor lead.  There is no definite evidence of a pneumothorax. 
 Bibasilar and retrocardiac pulmonary opacities and pleural fluid persist.  The
 heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  Tubes consistent with a
 mediastinal drain, left chest tube and a right subclavian catheter remain in
 place.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal study demonstrating no definite evidence of a pneumothorax,
 although the left lung apex is partially obscured.  There is no significant
 interval change
