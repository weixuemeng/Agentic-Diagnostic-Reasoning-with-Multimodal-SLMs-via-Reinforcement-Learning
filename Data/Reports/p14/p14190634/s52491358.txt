                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.  There is patchy opacities at the left lung base with very mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting mild atelectasis. Otherwise
 the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A
 fracture of the left posterior lateral fourth rib appears unchanged consistent
 with an older injury. Mild volume loss of a lower thoracic vertebral body is
 stable. A mid thoracic compression deformity of mild to moderate degree is
 also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute injury.  Minor left basilar atelectasis.
