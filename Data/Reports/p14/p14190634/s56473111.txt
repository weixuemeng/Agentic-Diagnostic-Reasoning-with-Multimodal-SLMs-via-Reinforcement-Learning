                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia or acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS and IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis is platelike.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Top normal cardiac size is exaggerated by
 low lung volumes.  The pulmonary vasculature is minimally engorged.  The hilar
 structures and mediastinum contours appear unremarkable.  Calcifications are
 seen within the aortic knob.  A compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebrae is age indeterminate.  There is a deformity of the left ribs which
 reflects prior trauma, but a midthoracic vertebral compression fracture of
 uncertain age, should be evaluated clinically.
