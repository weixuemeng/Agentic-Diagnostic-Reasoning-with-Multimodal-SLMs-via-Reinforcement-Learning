                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastroparesis, malaise, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung parenchyma shows
 no relevant change.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 However, on the frontal radiographs only, a rounded structure has newly
 appeared.  The structure projects over the dorsal part of the eighth rib and
 has a diameter of 1.5 cm.  It is not visible on the lateral radiograph.  Given
 that this structure has newly occurred, it is likely reflecting a foreign body
 or object outside the patient.  A repeat radiograph should be performed to
 confirm this.
