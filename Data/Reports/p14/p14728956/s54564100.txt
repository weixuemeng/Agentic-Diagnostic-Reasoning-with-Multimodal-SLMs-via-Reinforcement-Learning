                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal failure with fluid resuscitation, to assess for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 There has been development of substantial bilateral opacifications consistent
 with volume overload.  The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, suggesting
 combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
