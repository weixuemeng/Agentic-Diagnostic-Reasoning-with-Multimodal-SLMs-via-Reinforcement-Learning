                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diastolic heart failure admitted with pneumonia, evaluate change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ hours and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate bilateral
 consolidations consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Within the largest
 consolidation of the left lower lobe there is a suggestion of cavity formation
 demonstrated by a rounded opacification with lucent center, follow up is
 recommended.  Compared to prior, there has been a decrease in the degree of
 opacification suggesting interval diuresis of pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or new consolidation. 
 Abdominal coils are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral multifocal pneumonia with interval
 improvement of pulmonary edema.  Close attention on follow up should be paid
 to the left lower lobe consolidation for evaluation of cavity formation.
