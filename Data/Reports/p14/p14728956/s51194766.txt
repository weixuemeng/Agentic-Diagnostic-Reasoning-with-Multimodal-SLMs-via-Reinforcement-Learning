                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and vomiting.  Assess for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates normal lung volumes.  Right
 lung base opacities are more conspicuous since prior.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  A round opacity
 projecting over right lung seen on prior right hip radiographs earlier today
 is not visualized, and it was likely external to the patient.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung base opacities, may represent atelectasis, aspiration or infection
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
