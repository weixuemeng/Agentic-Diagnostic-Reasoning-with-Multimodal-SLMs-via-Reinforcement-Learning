 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic gastroparesis, evaluation for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis.  The extent
 of the effusions is moderate.  The atelectasis are better seen on the lateral
 than on the frontal radiograph.  In addition, there is a non-gravity dependent
 opacity at the posterior aspects of the right lower lobe that might represent
 pneumonia.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged in unchanged
 manner.  There is no pneumothorax.  The patient carries a double-lumen
 dialysis catheter on the right.
