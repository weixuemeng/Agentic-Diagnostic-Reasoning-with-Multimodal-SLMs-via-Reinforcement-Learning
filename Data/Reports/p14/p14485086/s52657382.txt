                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:29 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Liver failure.  Gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Intubated. 
 Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusion, stable on the right, increased on the left,
 obscures the lungs which are probably less severely involved by the diffuse
 infiltrative abnormality evident on ___.  Whether that was edema alone
 or in combination with pulmonary hemorrhage or even infection is
 radiographically indeterminate.  On today's study, heart is normal size.  ET
 tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC and a
 nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
