                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypertension and
 septic shock.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained a day
 before.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Heart size is unchanged.  Patient
 continues to be in severe pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 large.  Bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.  With those multiple
 abnormalities underlying infection cannot be reliably excluded.
