                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sepsis and possible cholangitis, status
 post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at approximately ___ p.m. and CT
 torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous opacification of the lungs is increased compared to
 recent prior exam. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is detected on this single view.  Heart size is normal.  Aortic
 and carotid calcifications are noted.  
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular
 catheter tip projects over the expected location of the high superior vena
 cava.  An esophageal catheter traverses below the diaphragm with tip out of
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with increased bilateral
 pulmonary opacities, which likely represent a combination of edema and
 infection.
