                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cholangitis, pancreatitis, and
 questionable ARDS, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination of ___.  There is marked
 regression of on previous examination identified bilateral pattern of multiple
 patchy confluenting densities in the parenchyma.  The marked and quick
 regression in relative short time interval suggests that the lesion was mainly
 related to pulmonary edema.  A diffuse hazy density over the right hemithorax
 most likely represents pleural effusion that layers in the posterior pleural
 spaces as the patient is in supine position.  Only small amount of pleural
 effusion appears to be present on the left base.  No new parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of previously identified pulmonary edema
 pattern.
