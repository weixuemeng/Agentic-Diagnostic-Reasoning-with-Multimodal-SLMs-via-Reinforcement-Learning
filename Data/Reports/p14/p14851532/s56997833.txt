                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with epigastric pain, vomiting, fever and
 hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged and multiple mediastinal clips
 from prior CABG are again noted.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Hilar contours are
 similar.  Ill-defined focal opacities are again noted within both upper lobes
 as well as within the left lower lobe, not substantially changed in the
 interval, and better assessed on the previous CT.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Clips are noted within the midline upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of multifocal parenchymal opacities compatible with
 adenocarcinoma, better assessed on the previous CT.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
