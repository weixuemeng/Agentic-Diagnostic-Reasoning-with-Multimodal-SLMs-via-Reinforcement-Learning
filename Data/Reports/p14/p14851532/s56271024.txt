                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Infected sternal wound.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The sternum is not well assessed with this technique.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, including mild cardiomegaly
 as well as calcification and tortuosity of the aorta.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is probably hyperinflated to some degree.
 A coarse irregular reticular opacification in the left upper lung is a stable
 chronic-appearing but non-specific finding.  Streaky opacities at the left
 lung base suggest minor scarring.  A stable focal nodular opacity projecting
 over the right upper lobe.  As before, a small nipple shadow projects over the
 right mid chest.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
