 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Coughing, status post unstable chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation.  Otherwise, the appearance of the lung parenchyma, the
 mediastinum and the cardiac silhouette, including the monitoring and support
 devices as well as sternal fixations, is stable.
