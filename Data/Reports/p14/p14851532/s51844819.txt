                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, now with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear hyperexpanded.  There is mild increased pulmonary
 vascular congestion from ___.  A small right pleural effusion is likely
 present with mild right basilar atelectasis. Right base consolidation is not
 entirely excluded. No significant left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Suture chain material and scarring in the left upper-to-mid lung
 zone is not significantly changed.  Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are
 compatible with history of CABG surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal
 in size but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits with moderate tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  Lobulation
 at the apex of the left hemi thorax along the mediastinal border is stable,
 residual of slowly resolving hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion from ___ with small right
 pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.  Right basilar opacity may be
 combination of above, but underlying consolidation due to infection is not
 excluded.
 2.  Staple, suture material and scar in the left upper-to-mid lung.
