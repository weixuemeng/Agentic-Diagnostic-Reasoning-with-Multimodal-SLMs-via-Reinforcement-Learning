                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p PEA and now s/p extubation w/tachypnea  // please assess
 for interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC as
 before.  Enteric tube courses into the stomach.  Since the prior study the
 lungs appear better aerated bilaterally.  Moderate right pleural effusion is
 slightly decreased.  Left retrocardiac opacity is improving.  The heart
 remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The
 aortic arch is calcified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving lung aeration bilaterally with resolving left retrocardiac opacity
 and decreasing size of moderate right pleural effusion.
