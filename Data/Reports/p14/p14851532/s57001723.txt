                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of non-small cell lung carcinoma
 status post lung resection adjacent to the major fissure, now presenting with
 acute chest pain and EKG changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Heterogeneous consolidation within the
 mid-to-upper left lung corresponds with opacity of concern on prior chest CT,
 suspicious for reccurrence of malignancy.  Additional concerning nodules seen
 on prior CT are not well characterized on this radiographic examination. 
 Linear opacities in the lung bases and right mid lung likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Prominence of the interstitium is likely related to
 technique.  No overt pulmonary edema is evident  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles may be due to small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heterogeneous opacity in the left mid lung, concerning for primary lung
 malignancy, better characterized on recent prior CT.
 
 2.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions. No overt pulmonary edema.
