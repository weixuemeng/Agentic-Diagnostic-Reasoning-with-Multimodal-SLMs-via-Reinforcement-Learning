                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of feeding tube, which coils in the stomach, and
 subsequently courses cephalad with distal tip directed cephalad above the
 level of the clavicles within the proximal thoracic esophagus.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for improving pulmonary edema and slight decrease in
 mass-like opacity at left apex which has been more fully evaluated by prior
 CT.  Left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions appear similar.
 
 Nurse ___ was informed of the malposition of the feeding tube at
 8:10 p.m. on ___ by telephone at the time of discovery.
