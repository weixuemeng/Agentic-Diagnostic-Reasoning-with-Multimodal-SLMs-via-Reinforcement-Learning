                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP semi-erect portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:44.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  In the interval
 since the prior study, there is increase in interstitial markings bilaterally,
 particularly centrally, worrisome for worsening pulmonary edema.  Right
 basilar opacity is again seen, which may be due to fluid overload, although an
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Small right pleural effusion was
 better seen on CT as was left lower lobe opacities.  Surgical clips are noted
 overlying the left upper mediastinum.  Aortic knob calcifications again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in interstitial markings bilaterally since the
 prior study raises concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 Small right pleural effusion, better assessed on preceding CT.
 
 Left lower lobe opacities better seen on CT
