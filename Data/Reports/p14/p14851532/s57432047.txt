                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Multiple sternotomy
 wires appear to be displaced to one side or the other suggesting sternal
 dehiscence. Please see CT of the torso obtained later the same day for further
 details.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multilobar pneumonia and respiratory failure, evaluate ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube is 3.5 cm above the carina.  The
 enteric tube is within the esophagus but appears to terminate at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Exact position could be determined with an
 abdominal radiograph if necessary.  Extensive carotid calcifications are
 noted.  
 
 Multifocal opacities within the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe,
 are consistent with pneumonia.  Sutures and scarring are seen in the left
 upper lung, likely from prior surgery.  The heart is mildly enlarged and there
 is mild pulmonary edema.  There are small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
