                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p PEA and now s/p extubation w/tachypnea  // interval
 changes      interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube
 has been removed, as has the nasogastric tube.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Opacification at the right base is consistent with collapse in the right
 middle and lower lobe with possible pleural effusion.  Less prominent left
 basilar opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and probable small effusion.
