 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had a prior sternal resection with consequent deformity of the
 anterior chest wall.  The trachea is central.  The cardiomediastinal contour
 is within normal limits.  Coronary artery bypass graft clips are seen.  A
 spiculated opacity in the right upper lung is less conspicuous than on the
 prior chest radiograph from ___ a more ill-defined opacity in the
 left mid lung is similar in appearance.  Both of these opacities were seen on
 the prior CT chest.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.  The visualized

 adenocarcinoma.
