                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, and prior pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including
 calcification of the aortic arch and moderate tortuosity of the descending
 thoracic aorta.  Irregular opacification in the superior segment of the left
 lower lobe appears similar to the prior radiographs.  Nodularity in the right
 upper lobe also appears stable.  However, on this study and since the more
 recent chest CT are bilateral pleural effusions as well as thickening of
 fissures an a mild interstitial abnormality predominantly visualized at the
 lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New basilar reticulation, bilateral pleural effusions and thickened fissures
 all most suggestive of new mild pulmonary edema.
