                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of non-small cell lung carcinoma
 status post resection of mass along the left major fissure.  Patient now
 presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Known heterogeneous consolidation in the
 left mid lung is not well seen on this single frontal view.  Additional known
 nodules are also not well characterized on this radiographic examination. 
 Linear opacities in the lung bases are similar compared to prior and likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema is identified. 
 Increased attenuation in the right mid-lung could reflect pneumonia or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles is unchanged and possibly due to small effusions or chronic pleural
 thickening.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Incompletely characterized known pulmonary nodules concerning for
 malignancy.
 
 2.  Unchanged subsegmental basilar atelectasis and possible small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Increased opacity in the right mid lung may reflect pneumonia or possibly
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.
