                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, dyspnea  // ? pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is enlarged but stable.  There are chronic coarsened interstitial
 markings.  The opacity in the left suprahilar region is partially attributed
 to postsurgical scarring as well as the previously seen consolidation, however
 is not well evaluated on this single frontal projection.
 Right pleural effusion is increased, now small to moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased right pleural effusion since the prior radiographs.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly, stable.
 3. Left suprahilar opacity is attributed to postsurgical scarring and a
 previously seen consolidation, however is less well evaluated on the current
 radiograph.  Frontal and lateral projections can be obtained for further
 evaluation as needed.
