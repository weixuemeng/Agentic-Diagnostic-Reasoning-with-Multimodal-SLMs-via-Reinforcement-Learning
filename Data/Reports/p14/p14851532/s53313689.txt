 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post sternal rib rewiring.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 sternal rewiring.  The patient is now extubated and the nasogastric tube and
 the Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed.  The other monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  Lung volumes have slightly decreased, and
 small bilateral pleural effusions as well as areas of atelectasis are still
 visible.  No pneumothorax is visualized.  The obviously postoperative opacity
 at the upper medial left aspects of the mediastinum is constant in appearance.
