                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right shoulder pain, evaluate for lung pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation.  The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding
 of bronchovascular structures.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 right shoulder is better evaluated on the dedicated radiographs.
