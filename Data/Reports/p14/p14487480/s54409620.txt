                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening headache and vomiting following motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate minimal
 heterogeneous opacity in the left lower lobe, more obvious on the lateral
 view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A trace left pleural effusion
 is present, as evidenced by blunting of the left costophrenic angle. 
 Bilateral breast implants are in place.
 
 The minimally displaced right ___ and 11th rib fractures seen on the prior CT
 are not apparent on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: Minimal heterogeneous opacity in the left lower lobe along with a
 trace pleural effusion may represent aspiration.  Attention on followup
 imaging is recommended.
