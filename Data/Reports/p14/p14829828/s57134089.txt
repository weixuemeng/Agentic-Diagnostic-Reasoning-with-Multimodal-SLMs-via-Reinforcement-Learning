                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with questionable right upper lobe
 opacity on chest examination performed at outside hospital.  Questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.
 
 Significant interval change has occurred in as much as the patient now has a
 permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to two
 intracavitary electrodes terminating in right atrial appendage and right
 ventricular apical position correspondingly.  The heart size is probably
 unchanged; however, significant amount of pleural densities on the left base
 obscures the cardiac border.  There is also evidence of right-sided pleural
 effusion, albeit to a lesser degree.  In comparison with the previous chest
 examination of ___, there are now also some right-sided basal parenchymal
 densities which cannot be assessed in detail.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax in the apical area and the right upper lobe area is completely
 unchanged in comparison with our previous study.  Thus, we have no explanation
 for the suspected right upper lobe pneumonia diagnosed at an outside hospital.
 Depending on patient's clinical findings, evaluation of the suspected
 pulmonary abnormalities could benefit from a chest CT.
