 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Splaying of the
 carina with possible subtle double density raises concern for left atrial
 enlargement.  There may be very trace pleural effusions, decreased since the
 prior study.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  Previously seen probable pulmonary edema has
 decreased in the interval.  Partially imaged is surgical hardware in these
 cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Possible very trace pleural
 effusions, decreased from the prior study.
 
 Suggestion of left atrial enlargement.
