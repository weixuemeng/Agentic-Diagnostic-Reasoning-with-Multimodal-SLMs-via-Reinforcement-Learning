 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  A large hiatal
 hernia is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests
 a trace left pleural effusion with mild left basilar patchy opacity, likely
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.

 Low lung volumes with small left pleural effusion and left basilar
 atelectasis.  Large hiatal hernia.
