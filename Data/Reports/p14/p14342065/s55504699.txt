 is streaky superimposed left lingular opacity suggesting plate-like
 atelectasis.  Bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted, consistent with very
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.

 Pulmonary edema with suspected trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Stable mild
