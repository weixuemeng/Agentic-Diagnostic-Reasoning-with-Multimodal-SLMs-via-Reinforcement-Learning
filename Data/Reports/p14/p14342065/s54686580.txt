  1.  New increased opacification at the right paramediastinal upper lobe
  concerning for developing infection.
  2.  Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, edema, infection, or a
  combination of the above.
  3.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement.
  4.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, here to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:   There is increased opacification in the right paramediastinal
 upper lobe. Patchy consolidations are present at both lung bases. Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable. 
 There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right paramediastinal upper lobe and bibasilar opacities may reflect
 multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.  Standard PA and lateral CXR are
 recommended to better evaluate the right mediastinal region in order to
 exclude a mass in this region.
 2.  Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary congestion.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
