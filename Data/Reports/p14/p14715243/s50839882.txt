                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  History of Crohn's disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the region of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, abutting the
 posterior pleura, there is a lesion with central cavitation.  The central
 cavity appears to contain a small amount of layering fluid.  The lesion
 measures 2.9 cm AP by 3.9 cm craniocaudad by approximately 5.4 cm transverse. 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 dependent pleural effusion.  Mild dextroconvex curvature of the thoracic spine
 is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large cavitary lesion in the region of the superior segment of the right lower
 lobe, abutting the posterior pleura, with a small amount of layering fluid
 within the central cavity.  Diagnostic consideration include cavitating
 bacterial pneumonia, as well as TB and other atypical infections.  Malignancy
 is less likely, given the patient's young age.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with intravenous contrast is suggested to better
 define the cavitary lesion and confirm that it is parenchymal and not pleural.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results and recommendations were discussed over the telephone
 by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 17:10 on ___.
