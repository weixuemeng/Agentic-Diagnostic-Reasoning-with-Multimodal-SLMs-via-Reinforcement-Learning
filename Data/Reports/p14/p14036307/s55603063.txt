                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with patchy focal opacification of the left
 lower lobe.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left lower lobe opacity.  Although pneumonia or aspiration
 could be considered, findings could be seen with atelectasis.  Correlation
 with clinical circumstances and short-term follow-up radiographs may be
 helpful.
