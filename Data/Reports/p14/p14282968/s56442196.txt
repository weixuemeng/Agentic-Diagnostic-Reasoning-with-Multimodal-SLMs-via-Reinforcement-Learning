                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fatigue  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with terminating in the low SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Evidence of a hiatal hernia is again seen. Mild
 prominence of the left hilum is similar to scout radiograph from chest CT from
 ___ and may be due to overlapping structures. No definite
 lymphadenopathy was seen on that study, although it is noncontrast. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Portacatheter appears to have migrated slightly proximally, now
 terminating in the low SVC instead of the cavoatrial junction previously.
 
 Clear lungs.
 
 Hiatal hernia.
