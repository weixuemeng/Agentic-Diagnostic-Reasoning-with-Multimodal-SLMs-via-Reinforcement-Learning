                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and shortness of breath,
 intermittent for one day and bilateral crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, resulting in some bronchovascular crowding. 
 There are diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, without a discrete focus
 of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Minimal if any bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Although assessment of cardiac size is limited in this
 AP view, there may be mild cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No
 rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of mild cardiomegaly.
