                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CKD IV/V, asthma; DVT, PE in ___; presenting with right
 femoral DVT, started on heparin gtt, found to have acute pericardial effusion,
 question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  There is moderately severe
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, this is fairly similar to ___.  As before, there is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, which could reflect some
 mild interstitial edema.  There has been some clearing of patchy retrocardiac
 density, with minimal residual opacity seen there.  No gross effusion
 identified.  Extent of any pericardial effusion cannot be assessed on these
 views.
