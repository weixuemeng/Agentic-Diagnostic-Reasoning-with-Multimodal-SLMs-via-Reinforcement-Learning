                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, bloody stools
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged, accentuated by
 the presence of low lung volumes.  The aorta remains tortuous and calcified at
 the arch.  Mediastinal contours appear relatively unchanged.  There is
 crowding of bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Mild streaky opacities in the lung bases are likely reflective
 of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Vascular stent projecting over the right apex is unchanged.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
