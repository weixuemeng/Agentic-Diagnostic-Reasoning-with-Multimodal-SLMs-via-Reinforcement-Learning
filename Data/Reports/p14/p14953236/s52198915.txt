                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new shortness of breath, history of
 tobacco abuse, evaluate for abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta and no
 mediastinal masses are seen. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation,
 and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  On the right lung base
 confirmed on the lateral view in posterior right lower lobe area, there exist
 a few small scattered parenchymal patchy densities which are indicative of
 some acute inflammatory peribronchial processes.  When comparison is made with
 the next previous available PA and lateral chest examination of ___, these subtle parenchymal densities are clearly new as they did not exist
 on the previous study.  Similar as on the previous examination, the diaphragms
 are rather low positioned and appear flattened, a finding consistent with
 COPD.  There are no other for lung tumor suspicious findings on this routine
 PA and lateral chest examination in this apparent heavy smoker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided basal posterior scattered infiltrates indicative of
 bronchopneumonic processes.  Followup examination in about two to three weeks
 after treatment is recommended.
