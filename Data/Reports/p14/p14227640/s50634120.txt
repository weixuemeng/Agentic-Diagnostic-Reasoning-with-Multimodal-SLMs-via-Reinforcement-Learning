                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with cardiomyopathy status post biventricular ICD placement via
 left axilla.  Assess for pneumothorax and lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Biventricular ICD projects over the left pectoral region with lead
 tip in the right atrial appendage, left ventricular lead that enters coronary
 sinus with the tip adjacent to left ventricle, and right ventricle with more
 anterior posterior change in positioning. Lead wire, likely left ventricular
 wire, is looped and projects superior to the right hilus.  Clear lungs
 bilaterally without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged with mediastinal vein dilatation and normal hila. No bony
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Lead wire, likely left ventricular wire, is looped and projects over the
 superior right hilus.  No pneumothorax.
