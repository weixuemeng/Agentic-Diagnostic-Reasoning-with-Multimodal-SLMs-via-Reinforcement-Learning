 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low-lying, terminating approximately 2 cm
 from the carina.  Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach.  Heart size is
 normal, and mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Minimal streaky
 opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
