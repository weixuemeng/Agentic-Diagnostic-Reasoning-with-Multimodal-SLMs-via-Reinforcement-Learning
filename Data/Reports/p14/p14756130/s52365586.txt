                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p L pigtail placement 
 // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy is in place.  Inspiratory volumes remain low.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is new patchy interstitial and alveolar
 opacity at the left lung base.  No definite change at the right base, with
 there is a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening, tenting of the
 hemidiaphragm, and infrahilar patchy opacity.  No definite CHF.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, including thickening of
 the right paratracheal soft tissues, which appears  confluent with dense
 pleural thickening or fluid at the right lung apex, as before.
 
 The right PICC line has been retracted.  The tip now overlies the scapula,
 immediately outside the right lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New new patchy, predominantly alveolar opacity at the left lung base, more
 pronounced laterally.  It is possible at this represents alveolar edema in the
 setting of an atypical distribution of CHF, but the differential diagnosis
 includes a pneumonic infiltrate.  In the appropriate clinical setting, other
 alveolar opacities could have a similar appearance
