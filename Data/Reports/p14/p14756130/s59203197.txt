 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o myotonic dystrophy and T1a lung carcinoma s/p RUL

 Acute desaturation     Acute desaturation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little interval
 change.  Again there is shift of the mediastinum to the right with elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour, related to right middle lobe collapse.
