 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the nasogastric
 tube is not seen, though it extends at least to the lower body of the stomach
 where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  Little change in the right
 basilar opacification with increasing opacification involving the left mid and
 lower zones.  The appearance is worrisome for superimposed pneumonia.
