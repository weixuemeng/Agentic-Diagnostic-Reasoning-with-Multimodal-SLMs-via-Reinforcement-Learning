                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Bilateral effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Severe right scoliosis is again noted.  Small-to-moderate bilateral effusions
 are unchanged, associated with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild vascular congestion has increased.  Right perihilar
 opacities have increased.  This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
