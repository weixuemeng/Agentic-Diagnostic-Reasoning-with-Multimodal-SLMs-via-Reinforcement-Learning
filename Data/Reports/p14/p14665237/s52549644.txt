                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with dyspnea and fever and abdominal distention.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are
 bibasilar opacities, somewhat more confluent on the left than on the right
 with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, particularly in the retrocardiac
 region.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 assess given silhouetting.  Lower thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted.  Upper
 thoracic laminectomies are suspected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities compatible with infection in the proper
 clinical setting.  There may be superimposed component of effusion on the
 left.  Probable upper thoracic laminectomy changes.
