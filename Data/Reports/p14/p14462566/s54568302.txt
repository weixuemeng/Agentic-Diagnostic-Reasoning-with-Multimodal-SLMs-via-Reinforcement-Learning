 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures as a result of the low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is noted with peribronchial cuffing.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Degenerative changes of both
 glenohumeral joints are seen.
