                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with GI bleed, intubated  // Confim ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 21:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.1 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 terminates in the upper SVC, unchanged.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are similar.  Hazy opacities within the lungs likely reflect layering small to
 moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right. 
 Opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Multiple
 clips in the upper abdomen are again noted along with an inferior vena cava
 filter.  No large pneumothorax is detected however the left apex is excluded
 from the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Layering small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, slightly
 larger on the right.
 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis.
