                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hematemesis, abdominal pain, hypoxia, left
 rhonchi
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Mediastinal contours appear unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature does
 not appear engorged.  Hazy opacities within the lungs likely reflect small to
 moderate size layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.  Multiple clips are noted in the mid
 and left upper abdomen as well as within the left neck.  An inferior vena cava
 filter is also partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate size layering bilateral pleural effusions and probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.
