                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, history of breast cancer. Please evaluate
 for PNA, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is an ___ x 15 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the left ninth posterior rib adjacent to the left
 heart border in the left lower lung. When comparison is made with the prior
 PET-CT, this finding likely corresponds with a prominent left nipple shadow.
 This is confirmed on the lateral projection. Lungs are otherwise clear. No
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
 Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung most likely reflects a
 prominent nipple shadow. Otherwise unremarkable exam.
