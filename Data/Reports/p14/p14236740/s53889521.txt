                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with restrictive pulmonary function
 tests, severe chronic obstructive asthma, evaluate for possible infiltrates. 
 The patient had recent leg edema and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Poor inspirational effort results in rather high positioned
 diaphragms with thereto related crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature on
 the bases.  Major portions of the heart shadow are concealed; however, some
 moderate cardiac enlargement appears to be present.  Thoracic aorta is mildly
 elongated, but does not show any local contour abnormalities.  In the
 pulmonary vasculature, an upper zone redistribution pattern is noted, but
 there is absence of any advanced interstitial or alveolar edema.  Also, the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free of any fluid accumulation
 and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area on either side.  The thoracic
 spine demonstrates a moderate degree of S-shaped scoliosis with more prominent
 convexity to the left on the base.  No other significant skeletal
 abnormalities are noted.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild cardiac enlargement, poor inspirational effort and crowded
 appearance of pulmonary vasculature with possible upper zone redistribution
 pattern, but absence of advanced congestion and no pleural effusion.  The
 findings most likely represent mild cardiac enlargement with mild degree of
 pulmonary congestion.  Cardiac evaluation or followup chest examination is
 recommended.  No acute infiltrates of inflammatory nature are identified.
