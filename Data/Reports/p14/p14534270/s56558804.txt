                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain with radiation down the left arm. Evaluation of the
 aortic contour.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a ring-shaped opacity right
 upper lobe, previously seen on PET-CT from ___, and described as a
 cavitary nodule.  Additional pulmonary nodules identified on recent PET-CT are
 not as well evaluated on this study, as CT is more sensitive.  The heart size
 is stable and the aortic contour is tortuous, but unchanged since the prior
 study.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
