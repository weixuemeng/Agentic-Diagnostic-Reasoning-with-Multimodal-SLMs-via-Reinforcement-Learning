                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___ chest CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes exaggerate the cardiac size, although it is
 probably slightly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Left lower lobe opacity
 corresponds to known pulmonary nodules.  Additional left perihilar nodule is
 also noted, better assessed on the recent chest CT.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia or pleural effusion. Pulmonary edema has improved substantially
 since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion.  Multiple faint
 opacities consistent with the patient's metastatic chest nodules, better
 assessed on the recent chest CT.
