                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD presenting with cough and wheeze  //
 pulmonary edema? pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with history of COPD.  There is
 persistent tenting of the right diaphragm and right upper lung
 scarring/fibrotic changes.  Heterogeneous right mid lung opacities are again
 seen.Subtle 0.7 cm nodular opacity projecting at the level of the posterior
 left eighth rib is not well assessed on this study but could represent a
 pulmonary nodule.  Recommend nonemergent chest CT for further assessment.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.

 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent chest CT for further assessment of
 subcentimeter left mid lung nodular opacity.
