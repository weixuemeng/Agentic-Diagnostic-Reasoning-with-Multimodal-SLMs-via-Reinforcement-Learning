                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Pleural thickening within the right lung
 apex is similar to prior radiograph and better characterized on prior CT. 
 Previously seen subtle right upper lobe peripheral nodular opacities have
 increased and now also involve the left upper lobe as well, findings
 consistent with increased bronchiolitis.  Lungs are hyperexpanded though
 without confluent consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased biapical bronchiolitis, concerning for an infectious etiology.
 2.  Unchanged right apical pleural thickening which warrants CT followup as
 described on chest CT report from ___.
 3.  Hyperexpanded lungs, unchanged.
