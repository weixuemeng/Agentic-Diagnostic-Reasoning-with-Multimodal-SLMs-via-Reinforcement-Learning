                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles with small pleural effusions
 again seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  There is a
 single-lead left-sided pacemaker with lead unchanged in position.  No new
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild opacity along the pleura, which may be due to
 small pleural effusions versus pleural thickening, stable.
