                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with no
 overt pulmonary edema noted.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are more
 apparent within the left lung base, likely reflective of atelectasis. 
 Infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.
