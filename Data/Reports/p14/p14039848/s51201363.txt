 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Patchy and linear opacities
 in the mid and lower lungs are new and probably represent multifocal
 atelectasis in the setting of recent procedure.  Cervical stimulator device is
 incompletely imaged on this radiograph, but has been more fully assessed by
 dedicated cervical spine radiographs performed earlier the same date.
