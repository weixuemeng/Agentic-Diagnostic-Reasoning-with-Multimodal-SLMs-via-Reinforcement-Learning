                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are horizontal linear opacities in the
 right costophrenic sulcus which are nonspecific.  Possibilities include
 scarring; an acute process such as vascular congestion, while not entirely
 excluded, is doubted given the fact that the pulmonary vascularity is
 otherwise within normal limits.  There is a patchy opacity obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm but most suggestive of minor atelectasis or scarring. There is
 mild leftward convex curvature centered at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Septal lines at the lateral right lung base which are nonspecific and
 could be associated with scarring.  Although not entirely excluded, pulmonary
 congestion is doubted since these are unilateral and not accompanied by
 generalized interstitial or pulmonary vascular abnormality. 
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity, probably compatible with atelectasis, although an
 infectious cause would not be excluded in the appropriate setting.
