                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral view, particularly along the anterior chest, is partly
 obscured because the arms are down.  There are widespread patchy opacities but
 with fairly focal involvement of the right lower lung.  These opacities are
 seen in the context of a mild diffuse interstitial abnormality suggesting
 slight vascular congestion or fluid overload.  It is difficult to exclude very
 small effusions, but no definite pleural effusions are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities, most confluent in the right lower lung,
 concerning for pneumonia; findings suggestive of slight vascular congestion or
 fluid overload as well.
