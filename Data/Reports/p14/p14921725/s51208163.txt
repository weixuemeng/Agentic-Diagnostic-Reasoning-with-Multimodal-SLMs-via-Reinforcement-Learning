                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Linear opacities in right
 mid and lower lung with adjacent lateral costophrenic sulcus blunting probably
 reflect parenchymal scarring with adjacent pleural thickening.  There are no
 focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Pleuroparenchymal scarring in right lung as described.
