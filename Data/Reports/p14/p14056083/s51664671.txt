 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 21:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, question CHF,
 question infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:11.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 21:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Single-lead right-sided pacer remains in place with the tip projecting
 over the expected location of right ventricle.  The heart remains stably
 enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion could
 have this appearance.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A patchy opacity
 in the right upper lobe persists and may represent an area of aspiration or
 pneumonia.  There continues to be perihilar vascular fullness and some
 interstitial prominence which likely reflects improving, but persistent
 perihilar and interstitial edema.  No large effusions.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
