 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with heart failure, on diuresis.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 7:42.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. A single-lead right sided pacer remains unchanged.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  There has been some interval improvement in
 the mild pulmonary edema, although there is a residual component.  The right
 basilar opacity persists and still could be related to the edema, although
 evolving pneumonia should also be considered.  Followup imaging would be
 advised.  Probable small layering right effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
