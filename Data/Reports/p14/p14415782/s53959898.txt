                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough and nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild diffuse
 increased interstitial markings may be due to minimal interstitial edema. 
 Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe could be due to atelectasis but in the
 appropriate clinical setting an early consolidation cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
