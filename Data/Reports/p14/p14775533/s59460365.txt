                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AAA repair  // eval for ptx s/p CT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increase in the
 amount of extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the bilateral chest walls, soft
 tissues of the neck, and in the pectoral muscles.  There is probable
 pneumomediastinum as well.  Bilateral chest tubes are in place. The
 endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. Nasogastric tube courses into the
 stomach.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is in the expected position.  No pneumothorax
 is identified, although assessment is limited given the extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Increased opacification of the bilateral bases is not
 significantly changed and is consistent with pleural effusion with compressive
 adjacent atelectasis and. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in the amount of extensive subcutaneous emphysema raises concern for
 air leak. No definite pneumothorax identified, however assessment for
 pneumothorax is limited given the extensive amount of subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were discussed with ___ by Dr.
 ___ ___ telephone at 17:12 on ___, 30 minutes after discovery.
