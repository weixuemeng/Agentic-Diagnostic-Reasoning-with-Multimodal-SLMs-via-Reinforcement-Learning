 EXAM:  AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  There has been interval
 removal of left internal jugular central venous catheter.  There are
 small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities are likely due to a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
