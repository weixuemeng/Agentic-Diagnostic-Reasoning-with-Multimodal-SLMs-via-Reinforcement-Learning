                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AAA repair  // follow up edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been a substantial change in the contour of the descending thoracic
 aorta, which may have enlarged substantially, bulging laterally, since ___.
 Alternatively this could be pleural fluid collected against the mediastinum.
 An upright view is recommended for initial evaluation.  I doubt that it is new
 left lower lobe collapse since there is no leftward mediastinal shift but that
 is another possibility.
 
 There is greater opacification in the right lower chest, probably increasing
 moderate right pleural effusion and worsening edema in the right mid and lower
 lung zones. Heart is mildly enlarged. Pneumo mediastinum or small medial
 pneumothorax are probably without clinical significance, since left pleural
 drain is still in place. Very severe subcutaneous emphysema appears to have
 worsened, although that determination is uncertain.
 
 NOTIFICATION:    Dr. ___ paged ___ to discuss the findings on
 ___ 10:18  1minutes after discovery of the findings, ultimately
 reported  by telephone to ___ on ___ at 11:14
