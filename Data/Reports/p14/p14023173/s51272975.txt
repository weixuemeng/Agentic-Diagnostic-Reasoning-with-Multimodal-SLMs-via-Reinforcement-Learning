 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dropping counts, anemia, evaluation for leukemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is newly occurred
 blunting of the right costophrenic sinus and of the diaphragmatic contour,
 suggesting a small right pleural effusion, potentially combined to a small
 basal atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged, without
 evidence of nodules or masses and with the normally appearing cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes.
