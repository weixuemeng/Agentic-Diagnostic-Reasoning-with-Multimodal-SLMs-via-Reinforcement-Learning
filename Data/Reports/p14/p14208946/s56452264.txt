                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with two-and-half-week history of cough and
 sinus congestion, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show appropriate
 inspiratory lung volumes.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Cutaneous suture material in the anterior upper
 abdomen on lateral radiograph reflects recent abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
