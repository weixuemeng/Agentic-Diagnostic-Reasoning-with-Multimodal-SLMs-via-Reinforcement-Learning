 As compared to the previous radiograph, the known lung nodules are unchanged. 
 The largest nodule is seen in the left lung apex.  The lung volumes have
 decreased and pre-existing parenchymal opacities, with a strong interstitial
 component at both lung bases, have increased in extent and severity.  The
 findings are consistent with recurrent pneumonia or aspiration. Unchanged
 right apical thickening.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
