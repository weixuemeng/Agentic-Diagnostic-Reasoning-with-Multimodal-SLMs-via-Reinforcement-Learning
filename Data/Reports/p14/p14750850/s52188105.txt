                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rales and peripheral edema  // r/o CHF
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, postoperative alterations in the right
 hemi thorax are stable in appearance in this patient who is undergone previous
 wedge resections. Fibrotic lung disease previously attributed sarcoidosis also
 appear similar as well as a dominant left upper lobe nodule measuring 2.3 cm,
 more fully characterized on recent CT of ___. Lungs are otherwise
 similar in appearance to recent studies except for a worsening opacity in the
 left retrocardiac region. Heart size is normal, and intrathoracic
 lymphadenopathy is stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of congestive heart failure.  Left retrocardiac opacity
 could potentially represent a developing infectious pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
