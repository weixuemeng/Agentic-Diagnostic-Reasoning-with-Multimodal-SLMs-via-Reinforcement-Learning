                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Diarrhea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Within the limitations of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Widespread interstitial abnormality appears similar allowing for differences
 in technique.  A large nodule in the left upper lobe is vaguely visible on
 radiography in the periphery of the left upper lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable extensive background abnormalities, but no definite evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
