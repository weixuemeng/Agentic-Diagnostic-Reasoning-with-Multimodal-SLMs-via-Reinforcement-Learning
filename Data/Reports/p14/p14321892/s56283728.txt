                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status requiring intubation.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph performed approximately one day earlier,
 the opacity at the right medial base has increased in density.  Additionally,
 a new opacity at the left base is present.  These are likely atelectasis given
 the low lung volumes, although aspiration or pneumonia are considerations. 
 There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The widened
 mediastinum is unchanged from the prior exam.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal.  An endotracheal tube is 4.7 cm from the carina.  An NG tube courses
 below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view.  This is new from
 the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Probable bibasilar atelectasis; in the proper clinical setting, pneumonia
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 2. Stable widened mediastinum.  If concern for aortic pathology or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy exists, further evaluation with a chest CT could be obtained.
