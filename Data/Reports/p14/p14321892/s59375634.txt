                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Agitation and recent intubation.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is present 4.4 cm from the carina.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Opacities in the right medial base and retrocardiac region
 are present.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The mediastinal contours are slightly widened, likely exacerbated by low lung
 volumes.  The cardiac size is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube.  
 2.  Bibasilar opacities could be due to atelectasis; alternatively, in the
 proper clinical setting, could be due to aspiration.
