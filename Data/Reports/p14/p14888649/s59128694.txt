                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with R-subclavian line  // evaluate CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube seen with tip 4.5 cm from the carinal. Right sided central
 venous catheter tip projects over the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax based
 on a supine film. Bibasilar opacities right greater left suggest layering
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis or infection could also be possible.
 Superiorly the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged as on
 prior. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as above. Bibasilar opacities likely due to layering effusions
 and atelectasis, infection not excluded.
