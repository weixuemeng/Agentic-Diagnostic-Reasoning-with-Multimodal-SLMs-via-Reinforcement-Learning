                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ANC 0 and non productive cough  // Eval for
 infection      Eval for infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the previous study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged without appreciable vascular
 congestion.  Opacification at the left base suggests small effusion and volume
 loss in the left lower lobe.  Central catheter extends to the mid to lower
 portion the SVC.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though the area behind the heart is not
 evaluated and it would be difficult to exclude superimposed consolidation in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
