 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML s/p 7+3 (D___) now s/p intubation on
 ___ for hypoxia, on broad spectrum abx for septic shock  // Evaluation of
 volume status and e/o infection     Evaluation of volume status and e/o
 infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter again extends well
 into the right atrium.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes are
 essentially unchanged.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing engorgement
 and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with vascular congestion
 that may be associated with over hydration.  Poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragms suggests small pleural effusions with compressive basilar
 atelectasis, especially involving the left lower lobe.
