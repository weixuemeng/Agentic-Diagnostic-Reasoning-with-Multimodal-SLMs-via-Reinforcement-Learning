                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  A mild interstitial abnormality is similar to the
 earlier radiographs but more prominent than earlier on the same day, although
 apparent change may be due to differences in technique.  There is minimal loss
 in several mid thoracic vertebral body heights, not significantly changed,
 with slightly exaggerated kyphotic curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar mild interstitial abnormality, probably due to vascular
 congestion, although not necessarily an acute finding.
