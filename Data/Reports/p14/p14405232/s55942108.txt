                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 Two x-rays demonstrating the process of insertion of the Dobbhoff tube have
 been reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube first demonstrated at the level of the mid esophagus and
 then subsequently in the stomach in the expected position.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Left internal jugular line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC.  Left upper lobe consolidation is unchanged.  No new
 consolidations have developed in the interim.
