                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
 altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs
 appear clear without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The imaged osseous structures appear intact.  There is severe degenerative
 disease at the left glenohumeral joint with calcification noted in the region
 of the right axilla, indeterminate, possibly representing synovial
 osteochondromatosis.  Consider dedicated left shoulder radiograph to further
 assess.
