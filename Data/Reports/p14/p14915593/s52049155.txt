 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Concern for sepsis, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP, semi upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Patient
 is slightly rotated which limits evaluation.  The relative opacity at the left
 lung base could represent an early pneumonia otherwise lungs are clear.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity at the left lung base could represent pneumonia
 though patient rotation limits evaluation.
