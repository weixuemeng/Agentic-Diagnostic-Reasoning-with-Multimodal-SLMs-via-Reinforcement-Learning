                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o CVA now with new wheezing despite
 nebulizer treatment, concern for aspiration vs fluid overload.  // ?
 aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 19:38.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The nasogastric tube overlies the stomach. The right IJ central line tip
 overlies the distal SVC. Additional tubing coursing vertically over the
 visualized portion of the neck chest and upper abdomen may represent a VP
 shunt.  The previously seen IVC filter is not visualized and may lie below the
 inferior edge of this film. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Compared with the prior chest x-ray, inspiratory volumes lower. Allowing for
 this, heart size is probably unchanged. Prominence of the upper zone vessels
 is again noted and likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. No overt
 CHF. There is atelectasis at both lung bases. Possible minimal blunting of
 left costophrenic angle -- an  early infiltrate in this location is considered
 less likely. Otherwise, no definite infiltrate or evidence of aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis new compared with the prior
 study.
 2. Small opacity left costophrenic angle of uncertain clinical significance
 --? Small pleural effusion or early infiltrate .
