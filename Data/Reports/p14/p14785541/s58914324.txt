 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p right hip hemi with h/o of emphysema  //
 question worsening breathing
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the now available lateral image shows
 small bilateral pleural effusions, confined to the dorsal aspect of the
 costophrenic sinuses.  No substantial areas of atelectasis.  No change in
 appearance of the normal cardiac silhouette and of the normal lung parenchyma.
 No pneumonia.  Minimal scars at the left lung apex and hyperlucency on the
 right are likely explained by the known pulmonary emphysema.
