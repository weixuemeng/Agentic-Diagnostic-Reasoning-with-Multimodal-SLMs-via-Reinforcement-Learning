                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at an outside hospital
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, likely due to emphysema.  A widespread
 interstitial abnormality is most consistent with superimposed fibrosis.  There
 is no focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia.  There is no vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine are
 of uncertain age, though likely old.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflation, likely due to emphysema.
 2.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality is likely due to a fibrotic interstitial
 lung disease.
 3.  No evidence of pneumonia.
