                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 CHEST X-RAY ON ___, 7:26 A.M.
 
 A long wire filamentous loop projecting to the left of the midline from the
 third through the sixth sternal wire has been present since surgery, and is
 presumably a feature of the rewiring of the sternum.  This finding was
 discussed with ___ at the time of dictation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:26 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Redo sternotomy, AVR.  Air leak.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 12:40 a.m.:
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably lower, exaggerating heart size and pulmonary
 vascular caliber.  Focal opacification at the base of the left lung is usually
 due to a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Pneumomediastinum and/or pneumopericardium have decreased.  Right pneumothorax
 is minimal, if any.  Tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 2.5 cm above
 the carina, should not be advanced.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right
 pulmonary artery.  Midline drains in place.  Upper enteric tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view.
