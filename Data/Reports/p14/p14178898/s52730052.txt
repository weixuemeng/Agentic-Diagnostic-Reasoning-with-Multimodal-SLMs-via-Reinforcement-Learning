                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, prosthetic cardiac valve and abandoned
 epicardial pacing leads are noted, not significantly changed.  There are tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is retrocardiac opacity which appears
 similar to prior exam and could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No overt signs of edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Bony structures are essentially stable.  Partially imaged vascular
 stent is noted in the upper abdomen, compatible with AAA repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persisting small bilateral effusions and retrocardiac opacity
 which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
