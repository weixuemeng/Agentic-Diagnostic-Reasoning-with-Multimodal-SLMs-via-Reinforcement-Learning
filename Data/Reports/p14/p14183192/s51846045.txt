                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver failure, Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 4:30.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 13:18 is submitted.  The right
 costophrenic angle is not entirely included.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which courses below
 diaphragm and the tip is projecting over the distal stomach.  Endotracheal
 tube, right subclavian central line and dual-lumen right internal jugular
 central line are unchanged in position.
 
 2.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Bilateral diffuse airspace
 process is again seen and has slightly worsened suggesting either worsening
 bilateral diffuse pneumonia or moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac
 consolidation with air bronchograms is again visualized. Clinical correlation
 is advised.  Possible layering left effusion.    No pneumothorax.
