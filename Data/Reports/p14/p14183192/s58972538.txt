                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, for followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube, nasogastric tube and right PICC are in unchanged, satisfactory position.
 A short catheter like device projects over the left neck and is of uncertain
 significance, but appears kinked.  Consolidative opacities involving the
 entire left lung are slightly worsened.  Right mid and lower lung opacities
 have also increased in severity.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval slight increase opacification the left hemithorax with increase
 in rounded opacities in the right mid and lower lung.  While pneumonia is
 likely present and this increase could reflect intervally worsened pneumonia,
 the acute increase is more likely due to superimposed pulmonary edema. ARDS
 cannot be excluded by imaging appearance.
 
 2.  Catheter-like tubing projecting over the left neck, correlate for possible
 kinked IV.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___
