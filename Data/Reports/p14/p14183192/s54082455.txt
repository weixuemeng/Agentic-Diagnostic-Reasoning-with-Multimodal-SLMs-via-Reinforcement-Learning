                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock, cirrhosis, worsening encephalopathy,
 intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 bilateral lung consolidations, worse on the left lung, have minimally improved
 on the right; these are a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  There
 is probably also loss of volume in the left lower lobe.  Lines and tubes are
 in standard position.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 If any, there is a small left effusion.
