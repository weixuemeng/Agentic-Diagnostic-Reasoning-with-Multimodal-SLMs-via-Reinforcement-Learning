                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bilateral rales at the lung bases with leg edema.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  There are minimal diffuse
 interstitial opacities seen bilaterally, but no overt pulmonary edema
 demonstrated.  Substantial interval decrease in the hilar lymphadenopathy is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial prominence, nonspecific, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  To exclude the possibility of interstitial lung disease, chest CT might
 be considered if clinically warranted.
