                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension and
 hypercholesterolemia, presenting for evaluation of chest pain and shortness of
 breath x2 days.  WBC ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse interstitial opacities, compatible with interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Additionally, there is a more focal opacity at the right
 lung base, which is most likely also due to underlying pulmonary edema,
 although superimposed pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is moderately enlarged, which appears new from the prior radiograph in
 ___, although it may partially be due to portable technique.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly with diffuse interstitial opacities and
 redistribution, compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  More focal opacity at the right lung base is most likely due to underlying
 pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia could be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
