                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension and
 hypercholesterolemia, now with worsening shortness of breath since the prior
 study performed several hr earlier.  WBC ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 23:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph performed 3 hours earlier, there has
 been an interval increase in the diffuse interstitial opacities and
 redistribution, perhaps slightly worse at the right lung base.  Along with
 underlying moderate cardiomegaly, these findings together suggest pulmonary
 edema.  There is no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A linear
 radiopaque line along the periphery of the right hemithorax represents a fold
 from the patient's gown, as lung markings are seen lateral to this line.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening interstitial pulmonary edema and redistribution compared to the
 prior radiograph performed 3 hours earlier.
