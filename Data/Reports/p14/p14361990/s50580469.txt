 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall with confusion.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.

 lateral views to be in the anterior thoracic wall.  There are no parenchymal
 opacities concerning for pneumonia. Heart size appears enlarged, although an
 AP exam limits accuracy of assessment of cardiac size.  No cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contour abnormalities.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic
 arch are noted.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
