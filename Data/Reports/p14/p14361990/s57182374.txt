                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Calcified pleural plaques within the left
 chest are unchanged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, new
 compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Radiopaque dense material within a vertebral body
 within the upper lumbar spine is likely from prior kyphoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis
 though infection is not completely excluded.
