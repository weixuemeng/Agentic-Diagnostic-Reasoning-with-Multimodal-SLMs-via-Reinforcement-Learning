                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypertensive encephalopathy, delirium and swallow
 dysfunction.  Assess for aspiration/pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 Bilateral small effusions, left greater than right, are more conspicuous than
 before. Bibasilar opacities have increased.  They are consistent with
 atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Left perihilar
 opacities consistent with a calcified pleural plaque.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are present in the thoracic
 spine.
