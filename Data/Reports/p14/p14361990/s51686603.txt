                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and orthopnea.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA, AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are larger since
 the study of ___. Adjacent atalectasis at the left base has progressed. 
 The heart is poorly visualized due to low lung volumes, although there is
 likely mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small, left greater than
 right, pleural effusions slightly worse since the prior study.
