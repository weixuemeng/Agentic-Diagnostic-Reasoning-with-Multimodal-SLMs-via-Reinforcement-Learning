 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing perihilar vascular fullness and indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vascularity which is suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary and perihilar
 edema.  More focal airspace opacity in the retrocardiac region could reflect
 lower lobe atelectasis.  There is possibly a small left layering effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 No acute bone abnormality appreciated.
