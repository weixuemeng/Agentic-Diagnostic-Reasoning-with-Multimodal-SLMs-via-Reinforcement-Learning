                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion worsening over 6 months  //
 Assess for infiltrate, effusion, lesion, and assess volume status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The hilar contours are within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is
 somewhat obscured by a moderate to large fluid-filled hiatal hernia.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is largely stable from the prior
 examination.  Lung volumes are somewhat low.  Opacity at the base of the left
 lung is likely compressive atelectasis related to the patient's hernia however
 underlying infection should be considered.  No pneumothorax.There is marked
 levoscliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Moderate to large hiatal hernia and adjacent pulmonary opacity which may
 reflect compressive atelectasis or infection.
 2. Persistently elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax.
