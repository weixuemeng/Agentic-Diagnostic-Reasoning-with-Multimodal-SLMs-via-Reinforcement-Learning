                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GIB going for EGD s/p intubation, evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes
 cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  Allowing for this
 there is likely moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is a trace left
 pleural effusion.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is
 apparent discontinuity of the lateral left seventh and eighth ribs and the
 posterior left fifth rib suggesting acute fractures.  Right sixth and seventh
 ribs also appear fractured in their lateral portion.  There is diffuse
 demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm from the carina.
 2. Bilateral rib fractures.
 3. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
