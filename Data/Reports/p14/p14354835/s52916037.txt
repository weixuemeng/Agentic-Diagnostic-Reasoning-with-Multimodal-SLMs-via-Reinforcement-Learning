                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with resp failure, intubated. Metastatic
 ovarian cancer. Concern for pneumonia, aspiration.  // Interval change?    
 Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:33.  Previously
 large right pleural effusion decreased slightly between ___ and ___, currently unchanged.  At the same time severe consolidation developed in
 the central portions of both lungs and on the left extends all way to the lung
 periphery.  The rapid development is typical of edema, but the early nodular
 quality is more suggestive of pneumonia.  Both processes may be con current,
 but I suspect pneumonia is quite severe.
 
 Heart borders are obscured and heart size is indeterminate.
 
 ET tube and right PIC line are in standard placements.  Esophageal feeding in
 drainage tubes both pass into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
