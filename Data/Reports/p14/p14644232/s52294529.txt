                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Pedestrian struck.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen with
 secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  There is no confluent
 consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax on this supine film.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, and in part likely accentuated due to positioning and
 low lung volumes.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch. 
 No displaced fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly without other definite acute abnormality.
