                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD  // intrapulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are hyperexpanded
 suggestive of emphysema.  A subcentimeter rounded opacity overlying the left
 second anterior rib is potentially due to healed rib fracture in the setting
 of multiple other healed rib fractures in left hemi thorax, but a small
 pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  Standard PA and lateral views of the chest
 are recommended for more complete assessment when the patient's condition
 permits.
