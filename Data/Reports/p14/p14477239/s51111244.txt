                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx of COPD and hypoxic.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, suggesting
 emphysema, similar to the prior exam.  A sub-cm, round opacity over the left
 anterior third rib is overall similar and appears to have a correlate on the
 lateral view.  This could represent a pulmonary nodule or rib lesion. 
 Calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe are unchanged.  Streaky linear
 opacities in the right middle lobe are new from the prior exam, best
 appreciated on the lateral view, likely atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size and extensive aortic knob calcifications are unchanged.
 
 Nonspecific gaseous distension of partially visualized loops of bowel are
 similar to the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right middle lobe streaky opacity is probably atelectasis.
 
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs suggestive of emphysema.
 
 3.  Sub-centimeter nodule is unchanged and may be in the bones or lungs.  This
 could be further evaluated with a non-emergent chest radiograph with shallow
 oblique views, or if still unrevealing, a Chest CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A non-emergent chest radiograph with shallow oblique
 views, or if still unrevealing, a Chest CT, to further evaluate a left lung or
 osseous lesion.
