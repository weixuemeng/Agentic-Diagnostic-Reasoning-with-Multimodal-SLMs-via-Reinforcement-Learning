                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ PMH of CVA, dilated cardiomyopathy with pacemaker, chronic
 constipation who presented on ___ with recurrent acute on chronic abdominal
 pain and distention s/p extended left hemicolectomy c/b leak now POD ___ s/p
 exlap, washout, revision and ileal diversion  // line placement s/p transfer;
 NGT place repositioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus
 the tip and sideport overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus.  It
 appears to have been retracted and repositioned slightly higher than on the
 prior study.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 2.3 cm above the carina.  Right-sided pacemaker
 type device is similar in configuration.
 
 Equivocal tiny apical pneumothorax.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged, though is better defined
 and probably slightly smaller lower prior film.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution D views vascular plethora and interstitial
 and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF with interstitial edema.  This is
 similar, but probably very slightly worse compared with the prior film.
 
 There are small bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Opacities at the right base are new compared with the prior
 study.  Opacities at at the left base are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip and side-port now overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus,
 but slightly different in position.
 
 Persisting cardiomegaly, possibly slightly improved.
 
 CHF with interstitial edema similar, but possibly slightly worse.
 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base, with a larger right effusion and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Persistent opacity left base, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 and small left effusion.
 
 Equivocal tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Findings regarding tiny left apical pneumothorax,
 repositioning of NG tube, and new opacities at right base were discussed with
 ___ in CC5B by Dr. ___ by phone at 21:11 on ___, ___ min after
 discovery.
