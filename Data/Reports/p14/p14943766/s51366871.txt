 INDICATION:  Cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Streaky opacities in the left lower lobe are likely atelectasis. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle indicates a
 tiny pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Subsegmental left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 2. Tiny pleural effusion on either the right or left side.
