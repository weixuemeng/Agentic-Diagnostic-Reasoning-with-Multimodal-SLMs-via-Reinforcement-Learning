                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cardiopulmonary arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT obtained ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.  Cardiomediastinal hilar
 silhouettes are unremarkable, noting a tortuous ascending aorta.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric passes below the GE junction and terminates in the gastric
 body.  However, the side port likely terminates above the GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.
 2. The side port of an enteric tube is likely located above the GE junction
 and should be advanced by approximately 5 cm.
