                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate nasogastric tube placement in a patient with small bowel
 obstruction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip terminates within the stomach, but the side port
 remains in the distal esophagus.  A large right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 There has been interval progression of multifocal left lower lung opacities. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, with the tip terminating in the
 stomach but the side port in the distal esophagus.
 2. Interval progression of multifocal left lower lung opacities, which could
 reflect progression of multifocal infection, or new edema.
 3. Unchanged large right pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Advancement of the nasogastric tube by at least 9.5 cm to
 place the side port within the stomach is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 08:20 on ___, approximately 10
 minutes after discovery.
