                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with significant coronary artery disease
 and COPD with severe shortness of breath, acute, postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with a previous PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___  Comparison with the previous
 frontal view examination shows that a previously existing S-shaped scoliosis
 in the thoracic spine remains unchanged.  Mediastinal and heart shadows are
 more prominent now than previously, but this is also explained by the
 patient's different position during the present examination.  The left-sided
 diaphragm is partially obscured and the left lower lung base cannot be
 inspected.  Left-sided apical densities are unchanged and are related to the
 scoliosis.  The right hemithorax is free and does not show any pulmonary
 congestive pattern and no evidence of pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unclear left lower hemithorax density on portable chest
 examination.  It is recommended to obtain a repeat frontal and if possible
 lateral view to exclude new pleural effusion.  Type of preceding surgical
 intervention that initiated episode of SOB is unclear.  Referring physician
 ___ was paged to discuss the unclear findings.  Page was
 unsuccessful and nurse was called on the ward.  She was instructed about the
 recommendation to obtain repeat chest view and lateral view.
