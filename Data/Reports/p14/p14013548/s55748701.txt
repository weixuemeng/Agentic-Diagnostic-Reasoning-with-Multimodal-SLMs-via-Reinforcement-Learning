                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleurx catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS: Compared with the study of ___, the chest tube has been removed and
 replaced with a Pleurx catheter.  The opacification at the left base has
 improved, though it is unclear whether this reflects removal of pleural fluid
 or change in position of the patient.  No evidence of post-procedure
 pneumothorax.  Otherwise, little change.
