                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is mild basilar atelectasis without focal consolidation seen.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
