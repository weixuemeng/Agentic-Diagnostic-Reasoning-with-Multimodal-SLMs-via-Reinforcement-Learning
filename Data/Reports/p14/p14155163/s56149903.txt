                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sickle cell disease, evaluate for
 infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Very vague hazy
 opacities in the bilateral mid lung zones, and more confluent at the right
 lung base, may represent pulmonary congestion or sequelae of acute chest
 syndrome;  however opacification is somewhat more confluent at the right lung
 base and developing infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is moderately enlarged and
 possibility of pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  There is depression
 of the superior and inferior endplates of the thoracic vertebral body, of
 indeterminate age and compatible with history of sickle cell disease.  No
 other acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly, possibly due to pericardial effusion. 
 
 2.  Hazy opacities bilaterally raising concern for mild pulmonary edema or
 possibly sequelae of acute chest syndrome; however, a somewhat focal component
 at the right lung base may be due to an early developing pneumonia.  Attention
 in short-term follow-up radiographs and correlation with clinical presentation
 are recommended.  
 
 3.  Endplate deformity of the thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age and
 consistent with patient's history of sickle cell disease.
