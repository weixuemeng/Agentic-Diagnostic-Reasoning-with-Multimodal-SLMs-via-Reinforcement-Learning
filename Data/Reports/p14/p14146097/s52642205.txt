                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PVD, newly placed PICC now with ? R hilar
 lung abnormality seen on post PICC CXR  // further evaluation of R hilar
 abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 previously identified right infrahilar opacification is probably due to a
 pericardial fat pad, pericardial cyst or lipoma.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Minimal, if any, pleural effusion. Bibasilar linear
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  There are
 serpiginous radiodense structures in the left axilla and right upper chest,
 which could represent soft tissue calcifications or external structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously visualized right infrahilar opacification likely represents a
 pericardial fat pad or potentially a pericardial cyst or lipoma.
