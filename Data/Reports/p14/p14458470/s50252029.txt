                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is noted.  The lung volumes are
 low.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is seen.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  Infection however is not excluded.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis, but infection is not
 completely excluded.
