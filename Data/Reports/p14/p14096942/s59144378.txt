                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NASh, PE intubated for procedure  //
 post-intubation CXR      post-intubation CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 16:00 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3
 cm above the carina.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  Overall cardiac an mediastinal
 contours are likely unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current
 study. Lung volumes are lower with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely
 reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  A curvilinear lucency underneath the right hemidiaphragm may be
 artifactual or but does raise concern of free air. Clinical correlation is
 recommended and followup imaging may be helpful.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by
 phone on ___ at 16:52 at the time of discovery.
