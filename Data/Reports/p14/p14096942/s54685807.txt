 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia and elevated WBC  // Please assess
 for infection, effusion, consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, new bilateral peribronchial
 cuffing and interstitial opacities may be related to fluid overload.
 Additionally, a patchy area of opacity has developed in the lingula, and may
 reflect atelectasis or a developing focus of pneumonia.  Short-term followup
