                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and question aspiration, assess for worsening of
 left-sided infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left mid and lower lung patchy consolidation is seen which is
 slightly less pronounced than on the recent prior compatible with improvement
 following an aspiration event.  A small left pleural effusion is also noted.
 The right lung is well aerated.  Sternotomy wires are unchanged.  Heart size
 is normal with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving patchy left mid and lower lung consolidation compatible
 with aspiration. Trace left pleural effusion.
