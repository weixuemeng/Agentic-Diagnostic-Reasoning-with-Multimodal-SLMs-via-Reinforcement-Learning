                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with worsening cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, on the frontal view, there is
 suggestion of some increased opacification in the lower lungs bilaterally,
 more prominent on the right.  On the lateral view, however, there is no
 definite abnormality.  This suggests that the appearance may reflect pressure
 of the pectoral tissues against the facet, rather than a true abnormality.
