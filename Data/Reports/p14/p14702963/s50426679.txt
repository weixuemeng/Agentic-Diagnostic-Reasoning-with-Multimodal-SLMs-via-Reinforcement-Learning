                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with COPD, dyspnea, intermittent chest pain  // evaluate for
 acute changes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Minimal focus of opacity
 projecting over the right lung base may represent calcified costal cartilage
 versus true pulmonary nodule. This was not seen on prior exam. Other than
 this, lungs are clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the right lung base may represent
 calcified costal cartilage versus true nodule. Consider obliques views to
 better assess.
