                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  A focal area of more confluent opacification is seen on a
 background of diffuse symmetric prominent perihilar and upper lobe vascular
 markings, likely representing mild pulmonary edema.  Heart is normal in size
 and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion
 and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Focal area of asymmetrically increased opacification in the right lower
 lobe is compatible with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema
