                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mediastinoscopy, please evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and outside hospital CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable hilar
 and cardiac silhouettes.  There is redemonstration of the right upper lobe
 mass with less circumscribed borders compared to ___ and overall
 increased hazy opacification more peripheral to mass.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Increased opacification of right upper lobe
 with increasingly indistinct borders likely due to hemorrhage.  Other less
 likely possibilities include increased size of mass, obstructive pneumonitis,
 or lymphangitic spread.
