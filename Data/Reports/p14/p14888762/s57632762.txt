                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. 
 Diffuse ground-glass opacities with increased interstitial markings are noted
 bilaterally, predominantly with an upper zone and perihilar distribution. 
 Findings are similar compared to the prior exams.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen, and no new focal consolidation is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is present though there are mild degenerative changes
 throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar appearance of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with increased
 interstitial markings as seen on the previous CT.  Findings could relate to
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and clinical correlation is recommended.
