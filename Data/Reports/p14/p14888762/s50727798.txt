                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there are diffuse interstitial abnormalities, with an upper
 lobe predominance.  They are not significantly changed from the prior chest
 radiograph or CT.  There is no new opacity.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged diffuse interstitial abnormality.  The differential
 diagnosis includes hypersensitivity pneumonitis or early fibrosis.  Although
 PCP infection is less likely, it would be a consideration if the patient is
 HIV positive.  If further evaluation is clinically warranted, could obtain a
 repeat CT of the chest with thin section reformats.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 5 p.m. ___ via telephone by Dr.
 ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
