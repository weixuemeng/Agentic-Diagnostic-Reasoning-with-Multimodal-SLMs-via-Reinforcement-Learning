                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of renal and
 pancreatic transplantation and a recent cough and leukocytosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Bibasal linear opacities are
 most likely representing areas of atelectasis but infectious process,
 especially given the appearance on the CT abdomen from ___ is highly
 suspicious.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suspicion for bibasal pneumonia versus atelectasis.
