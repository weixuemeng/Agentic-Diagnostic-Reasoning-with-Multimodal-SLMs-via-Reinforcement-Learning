                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with severe epigastric pain, rebound in epigastric and LUQ
 region, hx of necrotizing pancreatitis early ___ and NJ tube in.  Evaluate
 for free air and left pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube ends in the small bowel.  Left lower lung linear opacities
 are most consistent with atelectasis.  There is no new focal opacity,
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  There is no large pleural effusion, however,
 the technique and low lung volumes make evaluation for a small effusion
 difficult. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no free
 air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No large pleural effusion.  Left lateral decubitus or standard lateral CXR
 would be more sensitive for detecting a small pleural effusion. No free air.
