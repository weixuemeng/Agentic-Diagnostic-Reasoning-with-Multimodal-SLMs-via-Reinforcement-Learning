 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Subsegmental atelectasis is demonstrated in
 the left lower lobe.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.

 1. Enteric tube tip within the proximal jejunum, similar to that seen
 previously, without evidence for kinking.
 2. Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
