                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, pancreatitis, ? pna, ? PE at OSH  //
 r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Left lower
 lobe volume loss with linear opacification is consistent with atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles consistent with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Prominent left hila with obliteration of the aortopulmonary window
 suggests left hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.   Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Possible left hilar and adjacent mediastinal adenopathy.  Follow up with
 repeat chest radiograph at full inspiration is recommended to further
 evaluate.
 4. This examination neither suggests or excludes pulmonary embolism, a
 diagnosis made by Chest CTA.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short interval follow up with repeat chest radiograph at
 full inspiration is recommended to evaluate for left hilar and mediastinal
 adenopathy.
