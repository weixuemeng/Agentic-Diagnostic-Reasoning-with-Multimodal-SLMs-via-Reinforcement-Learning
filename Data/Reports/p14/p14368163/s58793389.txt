 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:21 PM
  Compared to the prior chest radiograph performed 2 days prior the lung volumes
  are slightly lower, otherwise, a left lower opacity and probably small left
  pleural effusion are unchanged. There is no new opacity, pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lines and
  tubes in appropriate position.  ___ ___:18.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG c/b ARDs  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Pleural effusion, small on the right, is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes may account for apparent increase in the general
 radiodensity of the lungs, but there also may be recurrence of mild pulmonary
 edema, and slight increase in caliber of mediastinal veins suggests cardiac
 decompensation or volume overload as well.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC.  Tracheostomy tube in standard
 placement.  Esophagogastric drainage tube ends near the pylorus.
