 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pneumothorax after fall, pigtail catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:44 a.m.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube is now off suction. 
 There is a minimal millimetric right apical pneumothorax but no evidence of
 tension.  An air-fluid level is seen at the right lung bases, reflecting a
 small fluido-pneumothorax.  No evidence of tension.  Unchanged appearance of
 the heart and of the left lung.
