                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Additional history per
 medical records reveals history of lung cancer status post resection and COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous exam from ___ is not available for comparison
 at the current time.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest.  There is a moderate-to-large
 right-sided pneumothorax.  Surgical chain sutures seen in the left
 paramediastinal location compatible with prior resection.  Assessment for
 possible mediastinal shift is limited given lack of priors available and
 probable underlying volume loss on the left due to prior resection and
 rotation of the patient to the right.  It would be difficult to exclude degree
 of mediastinal shift.  Linear opacity at the lung bases, suggesting
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise grossly unremarkable. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right-sided pneumothorax.  Evaluation for signs
 of mediastinal shift, limited as detailed above.  Finding of pneumothorax was
 known to the team discussed by Dr. ___ ___ after study was performed. 
 Evaluation of possible mediastinal shift was discussed with Dr. ___ by
 Dr. ___ at approximately 3:45 p.m. on ___.
