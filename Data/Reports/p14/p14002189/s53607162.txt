                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right pneumothorax status post pigtail
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Films from earlier the same day at 2:01 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior, there has been interval placement of a right-sided
 pleural pigtail catheter.  There is some persistent component of pneumothorax
 seen inferolaterally.  The patient is now positioned more optimally without
 significant rotation, and the mediastinum is in expected location.  There is
 some right basilar opacity seen medially, potentially atelectasis; however,
 continued followup is suggested especially given history of patient's lung
 cancer.  Surgical chain sutures again seen in the left paramediastinal region.
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right pleural pigtail catheter with
 decrease in size of right pneumothorax which persists.  Right basilar opacity
 as above.
