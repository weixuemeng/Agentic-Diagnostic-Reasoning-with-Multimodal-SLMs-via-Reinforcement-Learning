                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with triglyceride pancreatitis, now
 increasingly hypoxic and tachypneic.  Study requested to rule out overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there
 has been essentially no significant change. Lung volumes are slightly
 increased; however, there is still crowding of bronchovascular structures and
 accentuation of the cardiac silhouette. No new focal consolidations are
 identified.  The right PICC line tip now projects over the low SVC, at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Right IJ catheter is unchanged, extending to the mid
 portion of the SVC.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiograph with no new focal consolidations.
