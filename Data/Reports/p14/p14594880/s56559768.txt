                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PIC placement, confirm position.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 12:44 p.m.
 
 A left-sided PIC line is present.  As before, the tip is not well delineated. 
 It is seen coursing along the left subclavian on the frontal view and overlies
 the proximal/mid SVC on oblique and on the lateral view.  If additional
 imaging assessment is required, then edge-enhanced post-processing of the
 available frontal view may help for further assessment.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or
 effusion.  Mild hyperinflation and flattened diaphragms raises the question of
 background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided PIC line.  Based on the lateral and oblique view, I suspect
 this overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  
 2.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  No pneumothorax detected.
