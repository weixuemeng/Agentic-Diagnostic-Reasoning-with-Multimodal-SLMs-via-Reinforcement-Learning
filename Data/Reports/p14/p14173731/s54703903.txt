                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with acute pancreatitis.  Evaluate for pleural
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild increased interstitial prominence bilaterally may suggest mild vascular
 congestion.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is left
 lower lung atelectasis.  The left hemidiaphragm is also slightly elevated,
 perhaps related to the known ongoing intra-abdominal process.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  The thoracic aorta is
 slightly tortuous.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Levoconvex scoliosis of the
 visualized thoracolumbar spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 mild vascular congestion and left lung atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.
