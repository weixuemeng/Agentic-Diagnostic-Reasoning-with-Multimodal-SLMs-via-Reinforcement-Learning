                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough, sweating, and diffuse rhonchi.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has a history of Hodgkin's disease treated with at least radiation,
 accounting for the non-physiologic appearance of the mediastinum and
 paramediastinal radiation changes in both upper lobes.  Lateral view shows
 nodal calcification which has developed in the interim.  There are no changes
 in the contours of the treated mediastinum to suggest tumor recurrence,
 although CT scanning would be much more sensitive in picking up a subtle
 recurrence.  Lung periphery is clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart
 size is normal.
