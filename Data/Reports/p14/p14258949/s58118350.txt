                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of Mycoplasma pneumoniae status post
 treatment.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs. 
 The small regions of peribronchial opacification at the right and left lung
 base are much less conspicuous on this exam.  The heart size is normal.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Again seen is a wedge-shaped
 deformity of the mid thoracic vertebral body, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peribronchial opacities at the bilateral bases are much less
 conspicuous on this exam.
