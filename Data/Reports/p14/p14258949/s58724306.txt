 // r/o consolidation      r/o consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased opacification
 at the left base posteriorly has cleared.  However, there is the development
 of increased opacification seen on the lateral view just anterior to 1 of the
 major fissures.  This is consistent with pneumonia that is most likely in the
 right middle lobe, where there is slight increase in opacification on the
 frontal view, though it could conceivably be within the lingula.
 Otherwise little change.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___
