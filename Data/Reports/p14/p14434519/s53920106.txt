                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent pacemaker, now with tenderness,
 question wire placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 918.
 
 Single portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Dual-lead left-sided pacer with leads intact and terminating over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  Low lung
 volumes.  Heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial
 effusion.  Some overlying motion limits evaluation of lung parenchyma.  There
 is likely crowding of the vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  Given the overlying
 motion, a small pneumothorax cannot be excluded on this study.
