                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and bone scan from that same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are diffuse
 sclerotic osseous metastases throughout the vertebral bodies, ribs and other
 visualized osseous structures.  The increased attenuation somewhat obscures
 detailed evaluation of the lungs which are grossly clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process; however, diffuse
 sclerotic osseous metastases throughout the visualized osseous structures
 obscures detailed evaluation of the lungs.
