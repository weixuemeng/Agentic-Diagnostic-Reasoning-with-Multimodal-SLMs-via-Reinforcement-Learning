 with left rib pain after recent fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities in the right lung base
 along with new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, suggest extensive areas
 of subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes.  The right
 upper lobe and left lung appear clear.  There is no confluent consolidation. 
 No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The left heart border appears normal.  The right heart border is
 difficult to assess secondary to atelectasis.  No definite rib fracture is
 identified on this chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes.
 2.  No definite rib fracture.
