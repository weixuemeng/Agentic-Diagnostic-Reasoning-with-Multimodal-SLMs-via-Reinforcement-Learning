                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p office balloon procedure  // r/o aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right PICC has been repositioned from the prior exam and now appears to
 terminate in the mid to upper SVC (previously in the low SVC).
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings in the bilateral
 lung bases are again noted which appear unchanged on the frontal view, but in
 the absence of a lateral view it is difficult to fully assess if there has
 been interval change in these opacities. A small retrocardiac opacity is
 noted, which may represent atelectasis but cannot entiredly exclude pneumonia
 or aspiration in the right clinical setting. There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  A moderate hiatal hernia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval repositioning of the right PICC, which node appears to terminate
 in the mid to upper SVC (previously in the low SVC).
 
 2.  Small retrocardiac opacity, probably atelectasis but cannot entirely
 exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings communicated to Dr. ___ at 1:06 a.m. on ___ by phone.
