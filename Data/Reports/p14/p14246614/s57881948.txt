                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Extubated this morning, now reintubated.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is positioned low with the tip in the
 proximal right main stem bronchus.  A right internal jugular catheter and a
 left hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged position with the tip near the
 cavoatrial junction.  The lung volumes are persistently low.  There is stable
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and basilar opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 The apices of lungs are clear.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 possibly slightly increased from the prior exam.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged with persistent severe cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in the right main stem bronchus.  Recommend
 repositioning.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased in size.
 3.  Stable mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and severe cardiomegaly.
