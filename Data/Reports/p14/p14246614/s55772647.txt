                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, pulmonary edema.  Worsening oxygenation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.1 cm above
 the carina.  A right IJ central line is present, tip in the upper SVC.  An NG
 type tube is present, tip not well visualized but extending beneath the
 diaphragm, off the film. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There appears to be considerable
 difference in the height of the diaphragms, elevated on the right. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but probably unchanged.  There is
 dense retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Progressive
 obscuration of the left hilum is noted, ? secondary to CHF. On the right,
 there is diffuse prominence of vascular markings, consistent with CHF, though
 this is likely accentuated by supine position and lower lung volume on the
 right.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion on the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Lines and tubes as described.
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 3) Prominence of the vessels and of the left hilum, suggesting CHF, though
 likely accentuated by supine positioning.
