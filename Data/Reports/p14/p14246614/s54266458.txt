                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Treated pneumonia, awaiting dialysis, interval change in pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are persistently low.  There has been interval
 increase in size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette consistent with
 increasing cardiomegaly or small pericardial effusion, although there is no
 radiographic evidence of tamponade.  Mild pulmonary edema is increased from
 prior study.  A small left-sided effusion is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter, left internal
 jugular dialysis catheter, endotracheal tube and upper enteric tube remain in
 unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of the cardiac silhouette suggestive of
 pericardial effusion without radiographic evidence of tamponade.  Mildly
 increased pulmonary edema.
