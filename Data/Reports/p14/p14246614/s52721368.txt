                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is increased opacity at the left posterior
 costophrenic angle, potentially due to atelectasis or small effusion.  Mildly
 indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen, which could be due to
 combination of significant overlying soft tissues and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
