 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position after being pulled back 3 cm.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube has been repositioned, and is now in
 satisfactory position 3.2 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube courses
 below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view.  A right internal
 jugular central venous catheter and left hemodialysis catheter are in
 unchanged position.  Again, there is unchanged moderate pulmonary edema, small
 bilateral pleural effusions, and associated basilar atelectasis.  There is no
 new opacity.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged, with persistent moderate cardiomegaly.
