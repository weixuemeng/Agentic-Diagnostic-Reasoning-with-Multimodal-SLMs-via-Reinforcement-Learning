                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and chest pain, positive PPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Evaluation of
 the lung bases is slightly suboptimal due to underpenetration, particularly at
 the left costophrenic angle due to patient body habitus, as was also the case
 on the prior study.  Given this, no focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given limitations as above. 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
