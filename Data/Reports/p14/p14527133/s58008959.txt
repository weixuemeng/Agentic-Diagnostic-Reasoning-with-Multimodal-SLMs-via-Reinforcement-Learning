                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain after chest tube placement and removal.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette appears unchanged in size as are
 the mediastinal contours.  Continued opacification of the left lung base
 likely reflects a combination of a small left pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Size of the pleural effusion appears unchanged.  Right lung is
 grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with persistent left basilar opacification compatible with a
 small left pleural effusion and associated left basilar atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.
