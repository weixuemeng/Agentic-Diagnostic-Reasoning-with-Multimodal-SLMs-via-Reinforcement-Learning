                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are again
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, more prominent on the right. 
 Although this could represent a combination of pulmonary congestion with
 effusion and atelectasis, the asymmetry in clinical history suggests the
 possibility of developing pneumonia.
