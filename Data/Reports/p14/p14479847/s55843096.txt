  1. Dobhoff in the right mainstem bronchus with the tip distal in lung
  parenchyma.  No evidence of an opacity around the tip.  Results were discussed
  with Dr. ___ at 555 PM on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the
  findings were discovered.  The dobhoff had already been removed.  2. The
  endotracheal tube is no longer visualized, though the upper chest is not
  included in the field of view.  The other tubes and lines are unchanged.  3. 
  The left lower lobe appears better aerated, suggesting an improving
  pneumonia/aspiration.  Other scattered opacities are stable.
