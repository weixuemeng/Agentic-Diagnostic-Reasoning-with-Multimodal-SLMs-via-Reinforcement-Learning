                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:49 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with tracheobronchomalacia.  Extubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Heterogenous opacification in the left mid and lower lung zone, has been
 present for several days, probably pneumonia in the setting of chronic
 aspiration.  Consolidation at the right lung base is less pronounced, but
 probably similar in origin.  I do not believe this is pulmonary edema.  A
 region of bronchiectasis in the axillary portion of the right upper lobe shows
 more adjacent inflammation than before.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  Heart size is normal.  Aortic
 endograft unchanged in position.  Saccular aortic aneurysm configuration
 grossly unchanged.  Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the
 upper right atrium, left PIC line in the mid-to-low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
