                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tracheomalacia status post
 tracheobronchoplasty, evaluate for postoperative changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study, ___.
 
 Single portable upright view, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip in the
 proximal right atrium, unchanged.  An aortic endograft remains in place.  Lung
 volumes are lower in volume and there is crowding of the interstitium and
 vasculature in this patient with known underlying pulmonary fibrosis.  No
 superimposed consolidation is appreciated to suggest an acute infectious
 process.  No large effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  A  small amount of air is seen in the
 right neck and shoulder soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.
