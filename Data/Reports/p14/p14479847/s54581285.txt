 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:07 PM
  Compared with the prior exam there is loss of definition of the margin of the
  right hemidiaphragm suggestive of consolidation in the right lower lobe. There
  is also a vague opacity in the right lower lung field right where the anterior
  right 4th rib is superimposed to the posterior 8th rib. BIlateral reticular
  opacities are also sliughtly more conspicuous. Findings raise concern for
  right lower lobe poneumonia on the background of minimal interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:53 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia and multiple
 infections, now with fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___, heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lung has
 improved, but worsened appreciably on the right.  The variation raises the
 possibility of gravitational edema in the dependent position or,
 alternatively, alternating aspiration pneumonia.  Heart remains normal size. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is almost impossible to assess.  Aortic endograft has
 probably not migrated, but it cannot be assessed on a single frontal view. 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.  Tracheostomy tube in
 standard placement.  No pneumothorax.
