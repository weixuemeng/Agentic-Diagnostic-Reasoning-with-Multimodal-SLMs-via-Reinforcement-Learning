                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of pseudomonas pneumonia and fever and
 lethargy.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates heterogeneous
 opacities in the bilateral lungs, which may represent pulmonary edema in the
 setting of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.  Overall, the appearance is
 unchanged from the prior study.  Tracheostomy tube is in place.  Heart size is
 normal.  A small pleural effusion is again seen on the right side. 
 Right-sided pectoral Port-A-Cath ends in the proximal right atrium.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of heterogeneous opacities in the bilateral
 lungs, likely representing a combination of pulmonary edema in the setting of
 pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.
