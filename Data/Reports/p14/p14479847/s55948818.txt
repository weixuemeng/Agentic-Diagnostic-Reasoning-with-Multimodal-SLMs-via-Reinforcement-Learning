  Left mid and basilar opacities have significantly improved since ___.
  Some residual opacity persists at the left base. More mild opacities at the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post trach.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided PICC is no longer seen.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 again seen, terminating at the proximal right atrium.  Midline tracheostomy is
 again seen.  Aortic endograft is grossly stable in position.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes with areas of patchy opacity in the left mid to
 lower lung and to a lesser extent in the right mid-to-lower lung which appear
 significantly improved as compared to ___, but persistent.  There is
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural
 effusion.  Trace left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
