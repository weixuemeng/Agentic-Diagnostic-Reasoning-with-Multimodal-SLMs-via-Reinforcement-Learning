                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Anorexia, question acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Possible pectus excavatum.  The heart is not enlarged and in fact appears
 relatively small.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodule is detected.  There appears to
 be mild right convex scoliosis centered at T4-5.  No vertebral compression
 fracture or gross degenerative change is detected in the thoracic spine.  
 
 Compared with ___, the NG tube is no longer visible.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
