                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with right-sided lower rib pain, here to evaluate for
 pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low inspiratory
 lung volumes.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, significant
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Shallow right posterior sulcus may ___
 pleural fluid. Repeat radiograph of the chest with full inspiration should be
 considered if there is concern for right sided chest trauma. The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No displaced rib
 fractures are identified; however, conventional chest radiography is limited
 in evaluation of osseous injury.  Dedicated rib radiographs in areas of
 clinical concern are recommended.
