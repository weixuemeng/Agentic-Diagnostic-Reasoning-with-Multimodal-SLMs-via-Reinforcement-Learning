                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of critical AS, hypercarbic respiratory distress. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval improvement of the mild bilateral pulmonary
 edema, predominantly in the right upper and lower lobes, with a persistent
 opacity at the right lung base, consistent with pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Mild emphysematous changes are
 persistent.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Persistent right lower lung opacity secondary to pneumonia, however follow
 up to resolution with chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy.
