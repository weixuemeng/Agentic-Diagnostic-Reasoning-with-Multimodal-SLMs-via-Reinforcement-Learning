 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:33 PM
  Markedly limited study.  Left lung not well evaluated.  Hazy airspace opacity
  predominantly involving the right lower lung may represent a combination of
  atelectasis, overlying soft tissue, and crowding of bronchovascular structures
  in the setting of low lung volumes, however atypical infection would be
  difficult to exclude in this setting.  There is no obvious focal
  consolidation.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
  
  C. Hostage ___ at 17:28.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
  telephone on ___ at 5:31 PM, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with OI and restrictive lung disease, recurrent PNAs
 presenting with low grade fevers, cough  // Evaluate for community acquired
 pneumonia     Evaluate for community acquired pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  There ARE NO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS FOR REVIEW.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe scoliosis distorts the thoracic anatomy and projects the cardiac
 silhouette over the left lower lung, obscuring at.
 
 Heart is at least moderately enlarged.  Frontal view suggests mild edema in
 the right lung, but this is not confirmed on the lateral view.  Assessment for
 pneumonia would require CT scanning.
 
 Right humerus is dislocated inferiorly.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to  by telephone on ___
 at 9:07 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
