                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with nausea, lightheadedness with troponin of
 0.___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 There is mild fullness of the right hilum.  Patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy airspace opacities in both lung bases may reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Fullness of the right hilum for which comparison
 with previous radiographs is recommended.  If none are available, consider CT
 with contrast to exclude an underlying mass.
