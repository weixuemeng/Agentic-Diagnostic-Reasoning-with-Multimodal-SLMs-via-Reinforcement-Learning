                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  A faint nodule
 projects over the left 6th rib.  Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint nodule over the left 6th rib may be due to summation of
 shadows.  A repeat radiograph with shallow obliques is recommend.
