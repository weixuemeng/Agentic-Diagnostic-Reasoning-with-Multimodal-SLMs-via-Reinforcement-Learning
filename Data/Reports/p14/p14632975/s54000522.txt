                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypertension, here with intermittent chest
 pain, with intermittent cough from recent upper respiratory tract infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities
 are noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  Incidental note is
 again seen of an azygos lobe.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly low lung volumes with mild bibasilar patchy opacities, likely
 atelectasis, however infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
