                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Right chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.  On the lateral view, there is opacity
 projecting over the lower spine, which raises concern for a possible
 underlying consolidation.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior basilar opacity, best seen on the lateral view raises
 concern for underlying consolidation, which may be due to infection and/or
 aspiration.  Recommend followup to resolution.
