                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lung
 volumes are relatively low.  Bronchial wall thickening is present in the
 perihilar and basilar regions, but there are no localizing areas of
 consolidation.  Additionally, linear opacities are present in both lung bases.
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bronchial wall thickening, which may be related to history of acute
 bronchitis.  No consolidation to suggest coexisting pneumonia.
 
 2.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis or scarring.
