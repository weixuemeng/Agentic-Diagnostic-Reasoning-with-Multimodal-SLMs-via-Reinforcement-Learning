                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size appears to be mildly enlarged, unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  There is mild
 crowding of bronchovascular structures with slight upper zone vascular
 redistribution suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
