                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AFib, cerebellar hemorrhage, evaluation for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially
 reflecting increased ventilatory pressures.  Unchanged atelectasis at the
 bases of the right upper lobe and in the retrocardiac lung regions.  Mild
 fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No new
 focal parenchymal opacities that would suggest pneumonia.
