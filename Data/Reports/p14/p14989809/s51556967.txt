                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size in a patient with
 a dual-channel pacer device in place.  There may be mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Increased opacification at the left base obscuring the costophrenic angle is
 consistent with some combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower
 lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia will have to
 be considered.
