 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The pre-existing areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases are
 improving.  The radiolucency at the right lung base increases, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Otherwise, the radiograph is constant in
 appearance, with the exception of the ongoing passage of contrast material
 through the postsurgical stomach and the resolution of a right lateral air
 collection in the soft tissues.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette.
