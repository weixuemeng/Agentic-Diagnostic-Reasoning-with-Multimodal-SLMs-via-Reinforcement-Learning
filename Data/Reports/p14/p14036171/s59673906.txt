                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been removal of the
 right chest tube.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated, though a small
 apical collection of air could be hidden by superimposed ribs on the right. 
 The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged in this patient who has
 undergone a previous esophagectomy with a pullup procedure.
