                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient status post minimally invasive esophagectomy, check interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 A right chest tube remains in place with its tip in the apex.  Only a tiny
 right apical pneumothorax persists.  There is improvement in bilateral basilar
 atelectasis, though a small right effusion is still present.  There is stable
 postoperative widening of the right mediastinal contours, consistent with
 esophagectomy and pull-up procedure.  A left chest Port-A-Cath has its tip in
 the lower SVC.  The NG tube has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chest tube in place with tiny residual right pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Interval improvement in bibasilar atelectasis.
