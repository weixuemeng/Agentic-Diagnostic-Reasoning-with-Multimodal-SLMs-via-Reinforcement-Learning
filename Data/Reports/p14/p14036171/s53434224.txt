                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:30 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 5:09 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film on ___ at 3:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A left subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC.
 A nasogastric tube is seen unchanged in position within the neoesophagus. 
 Heart remains enlarged.  There is widening of the mediastinum, which likely is
 related to the neoesophagus and recent surgery.  There is increasing patchy
 opacity at the right base, which may reflect increasing atelectasis, although
 aspiration or early pneumonia should also be considered.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Right chest tube remains in place, and there is no
 appreciable pneumothorax.  A focal area of sclerosis within the right humeral
 head most likely represents a bone island.  Calcification contiguous to the
 greater tuberosity suggests  remote trauma or chronic tendinitis.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
