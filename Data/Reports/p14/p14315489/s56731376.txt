                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with lower lobe
 consolidation, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, is seen. The left
 heart border is obscured by this process.  A small right pleural effusion is
 also seen. Indistinctness of the hilar markings is indicative of pulmonary
 edema.  The upper mediastinal contour appears within normal range for size.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with large left and small right pleural effusions
 is concerning for heart failure. Post diuresis films to exclude underlying LLL
 pneumonia is recommended.
