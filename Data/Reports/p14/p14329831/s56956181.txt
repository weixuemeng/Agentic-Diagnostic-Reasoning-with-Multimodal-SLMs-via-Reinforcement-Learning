                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with upper gastrointestinal
 bleeding.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the
 same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged.  Left retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects known hiatal
 hernia.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small amount of left pleural effusion and
 left basal minimal atelectasis are most likely present.
