                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity at the right lung base, silhouetting the right heart border and
 defining the minor fissure, is thought to represent a combination of
 atelectasis, pleural effusion and possibly consolidation.  Opacification at
 the left lung base is presumably atelectasis. These findings limit limite
 evaluation of heart size. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax. Mediastinal structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Opacity at the right lung base is though to represent a combination of
 atelectasis, pleural effusion and possibly consolidation/infection.  Follow up
 radiographs are needed to document resolution.
 2. Opacification of the left lung base is presumably atelectasis.
 3.  No pulmonary edema.
