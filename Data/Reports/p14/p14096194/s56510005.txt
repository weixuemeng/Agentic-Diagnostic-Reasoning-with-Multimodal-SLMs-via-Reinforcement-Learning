                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, to assess for cardiomegaly, pneumothorax, and effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are persistent low lung
 volumes that may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter
 of the heart in this patient with intact midline sternotomy wires. 
 Opacification along the right lateral chest wall suggests increasing right
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base.  Mild left effusion
 is again present.
 
 Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.
 
 Asymmetry of the apical region, more opacification on the right, may merely
 reflect overlying bony structures and slight change in patient position.
