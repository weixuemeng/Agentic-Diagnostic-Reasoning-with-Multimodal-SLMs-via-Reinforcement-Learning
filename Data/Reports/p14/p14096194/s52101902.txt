                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Balloon placement for shock.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with earlier studies, the Swan-Ganz catheter remains
 far into a right lower lobe pulmonary artery.  It should be pulled back so
 that the tip lies within the mediastinum.
 
 The IABP tip lies just above the left pulmonary artery, approximately 3 cm
 below the transverse arch of the aorta.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis with
 bilateral small pleural effusions.
