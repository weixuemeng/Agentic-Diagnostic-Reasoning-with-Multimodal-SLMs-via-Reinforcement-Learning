                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate position of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Intra-aortic balloon pump is approximately 4.3 cm from the roof of
 the aortic arch and is probably too low.  Remainder of the support devices are
 unchanged, with the Swan-___ catheter tip persisting to be in a right lower
 lobe pulmonary artery.  Again seen is retrocardiac opacity with possible small
 left pleural effusion.  There is otherwise no change in parenchymal findings. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Intra-aortic balloon pump 4.3 cm from the roof of the aortic arch and is
 likely too low.
 2.  Swan-Ganz persists in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery
