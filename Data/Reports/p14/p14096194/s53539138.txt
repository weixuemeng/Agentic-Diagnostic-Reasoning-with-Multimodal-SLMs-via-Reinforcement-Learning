                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, question line placement, intrathoracic
 pathology.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4.5 cm above the
 carina (carina itself not well visualized).  The left SI central line is
 present, tip over proximal SVC.  A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip
 lying relatively distal over the right pulmonary artery.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:21 a.m., the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Patchy increased retrocardiac opacity is also unchanged.  Minimal
 right cardiophrenic patchy opacity and small right effusion are unchanged.  No
 upper zone redistribution is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) No significant change compared with one day earlier.  
 2) Please note that the Swan-Ganz catheter lies relatively distal in the right
 pulmonary artery.  Clinical correlation regarding positioning is requested.
