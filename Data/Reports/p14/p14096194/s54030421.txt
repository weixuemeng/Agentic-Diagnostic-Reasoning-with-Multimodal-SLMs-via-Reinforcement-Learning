                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cardiogenic shock
 after self-discontinued intraaortic balloon pump.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained the same day earlier, at 7:41 a.m.
 
 The current study demonstrates the Swan-Ganz catheter tip in the right
 interlobar pulmonary artery or right lower lobe pulmonary artery.  The
 intra-aortic balloon pump has been discontinued as mentioned.  The ET tube tip
 and the left internal jugular line are in unchanged position.  There is no
 change in the left lower lobe opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis in
 conjunction with pleural effusion.  No definitive pneumothorax is seen.
