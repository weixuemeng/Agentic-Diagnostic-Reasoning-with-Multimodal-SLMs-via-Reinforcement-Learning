                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cardiogenic shock and IABP and Swan-Ganz. 
 Please assess position of devices.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the
 semi-erect position.  IABP has moved up closer to the aortic arch and is now 8
 mm below the roof of the aortic arch.  It needs to be pulled back 3 cm to be
 in the desired location.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is too far into the pulmonary
 arterial system and likely located in the descending branch of the right
 pulmonary artery and needs to be pulled back 6 cm to be in the proper place. 
 Endotracheal tube and NG tube are properly placed and unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours and bibasal opacities are unchanged.  No
 significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  IABP is too high and needs to be pulled back 3 cm to be in the desired
 location.
 2.  Swan-Ganz catheter is advanced too far into the right pulmonary arterial
 system and needs to be pulled back 6 cm to be in the desired location.
