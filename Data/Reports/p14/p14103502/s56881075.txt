                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVC and unresponsive.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Trauma board and
 other overlying structures limit assessment of fine detail.  Endotracheal tube
 is directed towards the right mainstem bronchus, 8 mm above the carina, and
 can be withdrawn 2-3 cm for optimal positioning.  Fluid is likely present
 proximal to the tube cuff given the appearance of a meniscus obscuring the
 tracheal air column. The lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  No displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube is directed towards right mainstem bronchus,
 less than a centimeter above the carina.  Consider withdrawal 2-3 cm.
