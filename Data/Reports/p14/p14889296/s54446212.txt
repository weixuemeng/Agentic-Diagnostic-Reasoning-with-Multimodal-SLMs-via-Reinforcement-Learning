                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  PA and lateral chest ___, ___.  PA and lateral
 chest ___, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new onset cough and hemoptysis with history of
 right upper lobe nodule.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a subtle right suprahilar
 opacity, which likely corresponds to the known right upper lobe nodule and
 enlarged lymph node. However, this finding is difficult to assess
 radiographically due to its central location and relatively small size.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumonia.
 2.  Persistent right suprahilar opacity, corresponding to known central nodule
 and adjacent lymph node. Considering history of cough and hemoptysis, a CT
 scan of the chest is recommended for more complete  evaluation.
