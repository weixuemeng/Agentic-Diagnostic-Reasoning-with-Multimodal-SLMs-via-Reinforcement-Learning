                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent admission for pneumonia with recurrent cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  There is still some asymmetry of opacification at the left base,
 consistent with retrocardiac atelectasis.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Little change in the apical opacification as well as the substantial
 dilatation of the trachea.
