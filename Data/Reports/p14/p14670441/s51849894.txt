                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes remain low.  Heart
 size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged compatible
 with prior gastric pull-through and esophagectomy.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Opacification in the
 left lung base is noted with small left pleural effusion.  Minimal patchy
 opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Cholecystectomy clips are present in the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacification may reflect a combination of
 atelectasis with small left pleural effusion, though infection or aspiration
 is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
