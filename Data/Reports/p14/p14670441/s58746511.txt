                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slight increase in
 the lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged with some fullness of pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobe.  Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles.
