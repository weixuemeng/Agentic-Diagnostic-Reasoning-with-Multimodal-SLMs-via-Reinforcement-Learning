                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-up.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  Increased opacification at the
 bilateral lung bases on the left greater than the right may represent
 atelectasis in this setting.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests
 trace left pleural fluid.  Left apical opacification is stable in comparison
 to the prior study.  There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous with calcification of the aortic knob.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar
 opacification that is likely stable.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with prior cholecystectomy.  Surgical
 clips at the left hemidiaphragm and left upper quadrant may represent prior
 splenic surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decreased lung volumes with increased bibasilar opacities on the left
 greater than the right most likely reflecting atelectasis, although
 superimposed infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
 
 2.  Stable dilation of the trachea and unchanged opacification of the left
 lung apex.
