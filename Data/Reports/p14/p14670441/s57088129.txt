 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aspiration pneumonia, shortness of breath, evaluation for pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of the right lung.  However, on the left, retrocardiac atelectasis
 persists and left apical scarring is still evident.  The clips after
 cholecystectomy and upper abdominal surgery are constant.  The presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
