                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Newly placed central line, here to evaluate for position of line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs performed earlier the same day at 13:28 p.m.
 and 11:53 and 11:17 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating 4.5 cm above the carina.  There has been interval placement of a
 right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the
 mid SVC.  The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged with low lung
 volumes and opacification at the left lung base greater than the right which
 may represent underlying atelectasis or consolidation in the appropriate
 clinical context.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Prominent changes in the left lung apex are stable.  Calcification at the
 aortic knob and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is stable.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central line with tip in mid SVC.
 
 2.  Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the chest.
