                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with breakthrough seizures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes are low causing crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement
 but without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect
 areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in lung bases possibly reflecting
 atelectasis.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
