                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with foreign body aspiration.  Evaluate for
 presence of foreign body.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.  Please note that comparison to prior studies
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, accounting for some vascular crowding. 
 There is fullness of the right cardiphrenic angle which may represent patchy
 atelectasis although aspiration and/or pneumonia cannot be excluded. Subtle
 increased opacity of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure may
 reflect aspiration.  More focal nodularity in the right upper lobe contiguous
 to the ___ costochondral joint is felt to be due to a combination of patient's
 rotation and degenerative changes. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Heart is likely upper limits of normal in size given
 portable technique. There is no radiopaque foreign object visible in the
 thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of radiopaque foreign object.  Subtle opacity in the
 right cardiphrenic angle might represent atelectasis but consolidation cannot
 be excluded. Increased opacity in the right upper lobe could represent
 aspiration or early pneumonia. Follow up with PA and lateral chest radiographs
 is recommneded with an appropriate inspiratory effort.
