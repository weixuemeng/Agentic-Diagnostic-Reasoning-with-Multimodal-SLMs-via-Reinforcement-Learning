                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 604
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with almond aspiration, question
 aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 242.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 604 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are persistent
 low lung volumes with more focal airspace opacities in the right upper lobe
 and the right lateral lower lung and more diffuse airspace process throughout
 the left lung.  These findings could represent areas of aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  A more focal nodular opacity at
 the right upper lung contiguous to the first costochondral joint is felt to
 likely be degenerative in etiology.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No pleural
 effusions.
