                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with arrhythmia and lightheadedness.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The
 endotracheal tube previously noted has been removed.  Callus formation
 involving a left sixth posterolateral rib arch casts a focal rounded density
 over the lateral left mid lung.  The lungs appear clear bilaterally without
 definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with
 flattened diaphragms which could be indicative of underlying emphysema.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contour
 appear stable with atherosclerosis involving the unfolded thoracic aorta.  The
 imaged osseous structures appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Healing left sixth rib fracture.  No acute intrathoracic process.
