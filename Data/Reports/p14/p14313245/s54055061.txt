                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large subarachnoid hemorrhage, resolving pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is in standard position.  A right subclavian line is
 present with tip terminating in the mid-to-distal SVC.  An enteric tube is
 present with tip in the stomach.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low.
 There is improvement of the bibasilar opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in bibasilar consolidations, with radiographic
 appearance consistent with atelectasis.  However, if there is clinical
 evidence for pneumonia, it cannot be excluded radiographically.
