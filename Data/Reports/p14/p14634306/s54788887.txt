 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 16:42.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema, predominantly basal, worsened on ___, subsequently
 improved.  Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lobe base suggests a
 component of pneumonia.  Previous left lower lobe atelectasis has
 substantially cleared, but there is a roughly 5 cm wide well defined opacity
 at the left lung base medially there could be residual atelectasis or a focal
 pulmonary abnormality raising concern for infection or infarction.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Pleural effusions, previously moderate in
 volume, have substantially cleared.
 Endotracheal tube ends above the thoracic inlet, no less than 6.5 cm from the
 carina an should be advanced 3 cm for more secure seating.  Left internal
 jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into the
 stomach and out very of view.  Esophageal probe ends just above the
 gastroesophageal junction.  No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Reposition endotracheal tube.
