 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.  Delete
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiac enlargement has improved slightly and mediastinal veins are not
 quite as distended.  This hemodynamic improvement probably explains the
 decrease in extent of probable right lower lobe pneumonia.  The small more
 compact region of the left lower lobe consolidation either atelectasis or
 pneumonia has not improved.  Pleural effusion is presumed, but not
 substantial.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left
 jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
