                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bacteremia  // Assess for PICC line
 placement and lung opacity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC terminates in the left brachiocephalic/SVC junction/proximal SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm,
 out of the field of view.  Low lung volumes persist.  Right lung opacity
 persists which could in part be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and/ or
 layering pleural effusion although underlying consolidation is not excluded. 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
