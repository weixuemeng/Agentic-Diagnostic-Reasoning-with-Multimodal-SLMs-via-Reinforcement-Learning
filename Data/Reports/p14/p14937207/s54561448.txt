                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with anemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams dating back to ___ with most
 recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volume is seen,
 particularly on the frontal view.  There is faint opacity at the right lateral
 costophrenic angle, which could be due to atelectasis.  The posterior
 costophrenic angles are sharp, compatible with resolution of previously seen
 effusions.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint right basilar opacity laterally, potentially atelectasis
 given the lower lung volumes on the frontal exam.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
