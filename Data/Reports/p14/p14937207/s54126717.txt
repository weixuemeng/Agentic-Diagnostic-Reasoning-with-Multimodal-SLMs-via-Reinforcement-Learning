                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and possible consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Low lung volumes may accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  There is suggestion of some increased opacification at
 the right base, which could reflect an early pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Of incidental note is what appears to be dense
 calcification in the left neck and less prominent calcification on the right,
 all of which may be within the carotid system.
