                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of COPD. 
 The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Scarring within the
 lung apices is present.  Streaky opacities within the right lung base likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  No evidence for pulmonary
 edema.
