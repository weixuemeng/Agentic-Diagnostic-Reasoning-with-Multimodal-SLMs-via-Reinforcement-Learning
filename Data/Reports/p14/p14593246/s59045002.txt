 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:09 PM

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:47 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man on IL-2 therapy with worsening respiratory distress.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ 10:51 a.m.:
 
 Diffuse infiltrative abnormality has developed in both lungs much more severe
 on the right than the left over less than 36 hours.  Heart size is normal and
 unchanged and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement.  This is strongly
 suggestive of a pulmonary drug reaction. Left pleural mass, presumably related
 to rib metastases and left pleural effusion are unchanged.  Multiple lung
 nodules are obscured by the acute abnormality.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.
