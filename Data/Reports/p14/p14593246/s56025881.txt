                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC with known metastatic disease to lung,
 recent CT for r. effusion, and known PNA. Increasing oxygen requirement this
 morning.  // Please evaluate for progression of PNA versus reaccumulation of
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a right pleural catheter has
 apparently been removed.  Moderate to large loculated right pleural effusion
 has slightly increased in size.  Right mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy
 are a persistent finding as well as extensive consolidation and atelectasis in
 the right mid and lower lungs.  Unilateral interstitial opacities in the right
 hemi thorax are most suggestive of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Left lung is
 clear except for minimal patchy opacities in the left lower lobe and a small
 left pleural effusion.
