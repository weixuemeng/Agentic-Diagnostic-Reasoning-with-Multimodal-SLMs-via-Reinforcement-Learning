 unchanged position with the tip in the mid SVC.  The lungs are clear without
 consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 diaphragm with the side hole near the gastroesophageal junction.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
