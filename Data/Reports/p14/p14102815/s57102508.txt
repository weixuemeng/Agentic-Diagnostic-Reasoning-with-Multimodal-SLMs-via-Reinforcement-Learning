                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, sickle cell disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but appear similar
 compared to previous exam.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
