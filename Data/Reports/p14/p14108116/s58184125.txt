                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  Urinary catheter change of
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes exaggerate the heart
 size, which is moderately enlarged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema with
 small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis.  Diffusely increased bony sclerosis is similar to prior and
 consistent with osseous metastases.  Multiple chronic rib fractures and upper
 lumbar spine compression fracture are unchanged.  Right nephrostomy catheter
 is incompletely imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  
 2.  Stable appearance of known osseous metastases with chronic rib fractures
 and upper lumbar spine compression fracture.
