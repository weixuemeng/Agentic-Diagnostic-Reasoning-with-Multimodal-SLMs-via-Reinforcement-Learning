                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications.  The contour of the aorta is unchanged, and the previous CT
 has demonstrated aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Multiple right remote rib fractures are re- demonstrated.  Known
 blastic metastases within the bony thorax are better delineated on the recent
 CT, though an expansile lesion of a left lower rib is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
