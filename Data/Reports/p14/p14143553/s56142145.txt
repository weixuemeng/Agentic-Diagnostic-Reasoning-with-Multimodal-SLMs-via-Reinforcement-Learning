                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ month of cough.  // ? cause of cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration, and the
 thoracic aorta is tortuous, both without change since the prior study. . The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear except for a subtle patchy
 opacity in the right lung base posteriorly.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle posterior right basilar opacity, potentially due to a small focus of
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  However, if the patient lacks
 infectious symptoms, other potential causes such as lung neoplasm should be
 considered.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:
 
 In the setting of infectious symptoms, short-term followup radiographs after
 completion of antibiotic therapy would be recommended.  In the absence of
 infectious symptoms, CT of the chest would be recommended for confirmation and
 further characterization.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:24 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
