 with pull back of approximately 2 cm would be advised.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Lung volumes
 are low.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, which likely
 reflects a component of mild pulmonary edema.  In addition, there is opacity
 at the left base which may reflect a combination of pleural effusion with
 associated compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity of
 detecting pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.  Heart remains
 upper limits of normal in size given portable technique.  Results of this
 examination were phoned to the patient's nurse, ___ on ___ at 9:10
