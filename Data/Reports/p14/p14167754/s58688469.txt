  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, and an underlying
  infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Perihilar haziness and
  prominence of the pulmonary vessels reflect mild pulmonary edema.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  STEMI with stenting, altered mental status, questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There are bilateral pleural effusions of
 moderate extent and bibasilar areas of atelectasis.  Perihilar haze at both
 the left and the right lung hilus could suggest coexisting mild fluid
 overload.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
