                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to minimal
 interstitial edema.  The hilar contours are stable.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are also stable.  There is minimal left
 base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine, although the
 spine is not otherwise well evaluated.
