                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluation for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.  The patient has reported history of bronchoscopy at outside
 hospital with unknown results.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well-circumscribed
 large masses within the left and right lower chest as well as  the right mid
 chest in the infrahilar region. Given the well-defined borders of these
 masses, they may be pleural in origin, however, further imaging is needed to
 completely characterize.  A small area of atelectasis is present in the left
 mid lung.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The
 heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe and right infrahilar masses may be of
 pleural or pulmonary origin.  Further characterization with contrast-enhanced
 CT is recommended.
