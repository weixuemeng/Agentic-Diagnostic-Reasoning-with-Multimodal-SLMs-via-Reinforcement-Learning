 PA AND LATERAL CHEST DATED ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor, heart is upper limits
 of normal in size.  Upper zone vascular redistribution is present, accompanied
 by minimal interstitial edema.  Lung bases are much better aerated compared to
 the older radiograph, with patchy and linear opacities present, which most
 likely represent atelectasis.  Coexisting aspiration or early developing
 pneumonia in the right lower lobe is not fully excluded, and followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard, preferably with PA and lateral
 technique.
