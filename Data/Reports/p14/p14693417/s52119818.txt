                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  With esophageal foreign body, now resolved, history of hiatal
 hernia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evidence of hiatal
 hernia is seen with air-fluid level.  There is left basilar atelectasis
 without definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis.  Streaky left base opacities
 are likely due to combination of hiatal hernia and atelectasis.
