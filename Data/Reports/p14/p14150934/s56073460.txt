                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease, now with increased oxygen
 requirement, here to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right IJ central venous catheter is unchanged in position with
 the tip terminating in the mid SVC.  A Dobbhoff feeding tube is in appropriate
 and stable position.  There is interval increased opacification of the
 bilateral lung fields, likely reflecting increased moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is increased fluid extending along the left lateral lung
 base.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Bibasilar consolidation most likely
 reflects atelectasis.  Prominence of the aortic knob is unchanged
 corresponding to aneurysmal dilation of the thoracic aorta.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac  silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the
 setting of bibasilar consolidations.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
