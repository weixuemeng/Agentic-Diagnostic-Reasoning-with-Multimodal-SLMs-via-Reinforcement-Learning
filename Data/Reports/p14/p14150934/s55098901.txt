                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Burping, question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is
 prominence of the mediastinum with a lobulated left mediastinal border which
 when compared with the prior CT of the chest is reflective of known fusiform
 aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is a nodular density projecting in the right
 suprahilar region on the frontal view measuring approximately 1.9 x 2.7 cm,
 new from ___ and previously seen on CT remains concerning for malignancy. 
 The left lower lobe nodular opacity, better seen on prior CT cannot be clearly
 seen today.  No superimposed pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.  No pneumomediastinum.  No pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper lobe nodule remains concerning for malignancy.
 
 2.  Lobular left mediastinal border compatible with known fusiform aneurysm of
 the descending thoracic aorta.
 
 3.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
