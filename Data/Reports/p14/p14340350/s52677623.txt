 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Disorientation and dizziness.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is a mild to moderate
 diffuse interstitial abnormality which is not specific but could be seen with
 atypical pneumonia, interstitial pulmonary edema or perhaps extensive airway
 inflammation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate interstitial abnormality with diffuse distribution.
