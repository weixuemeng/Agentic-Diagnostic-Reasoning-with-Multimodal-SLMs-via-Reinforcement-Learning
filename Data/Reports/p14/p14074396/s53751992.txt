                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with SOB, right-sided CP  // Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change.  Large
 right pleural effusion is again noted with minimal residual aerated right
 upper lung.  There is also likely underlying combination of consolidation,
 atelectasis and underlying mass.  Known nodules in the left lung are better
 seen on prior CT.  There is no confluent consolidation on the left.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent near complete opacification of the right hemi thorax likely due to
 combination of effusion with underlying atelectasis, consolidation and mass.
