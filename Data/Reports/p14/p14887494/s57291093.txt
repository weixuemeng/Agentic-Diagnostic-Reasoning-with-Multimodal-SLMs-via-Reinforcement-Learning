                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New fever while on antibiotics.  History of septic knee.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line is difficult to visualize, but courses across the left
 apex and visible within the superior vena cava, although it is difficult to
 see the tip since the catheter is not very radiodense.  The lungs appear
 clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  PICC line in place, although the
 tip is not well visualized noting that the catheter is fairly radiolucent.
