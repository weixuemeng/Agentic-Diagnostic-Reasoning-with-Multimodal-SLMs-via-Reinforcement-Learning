                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Dobhoff, concern for dislodgement/coiling
 following general anesthetic  // Dobhoff position     Dobhoff position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the Dobhoff tube has been pulled back so
 that the opaque tip is several cm below the esophagogastric junction.  It
 could be pushed forward for more optimal positioning.
 Hazy opacification at the bases suggests layering pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis.  Otherwise, little change.
