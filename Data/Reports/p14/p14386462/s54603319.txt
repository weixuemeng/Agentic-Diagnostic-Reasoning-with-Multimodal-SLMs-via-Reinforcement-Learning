 A left PICC terminates lateral to the left chest wall, overlying the lateral
 scapula, and should be repositioned.  It does not enter the chest itself. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is probably unchanged.  Mild
 atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.  A drain in the right upper quadrant
 and a metallic right upper quadrant stent are not well assessed on this
 examination.

 A left PICC terminates proximal to the chest wall and should be repositioned.
