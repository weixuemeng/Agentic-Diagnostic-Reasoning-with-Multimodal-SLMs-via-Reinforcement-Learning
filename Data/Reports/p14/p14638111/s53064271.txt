                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with rib fractures and a right-sided
 pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier same date chest radiograph and torso CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube projects over the right lower lung field with tip
 projecting over the right inferior hilum. The lung apices are not imaged on
 this study though there appears to be small residual right apical pneumothorax
 component. There is no mediastinal shift. Previously identified rib fractures
 are better characterized on the CT. Subtle areas of increased density
 particularly in the bilateral lower lobes may represent contusion as seen on
 CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube in place with tip projecting over the inferior right
 hilus with trace apical of residual component of pneumothorax.
