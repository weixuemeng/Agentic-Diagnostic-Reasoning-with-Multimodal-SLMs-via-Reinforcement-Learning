                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with tachycardia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.  Allowing for
 the supine technique, patient rotation and severe scoliosis, cardiomediastinal
 contour is within normal limits.  Low-volume lungs are clear.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An opacity at the right
 base likely reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
