                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of weight loss.  Evaluate
 for evidence of tuberculosis with acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Frontal chest view discloses a significant right-sided convex
 scoliosis in the mid and lower portion of the thoracic spine. The thereto
 related asymmetry in presentation of skeletal structures such as ribs and
 slight left-sided deviation of mediastinal structures is noted.  The heart
 size is normal and no configurational abnormality is found.  Normal dimension
 of the thoracic aorta, which in its descending portion follows the scoliosis. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area nor are there any
 pleural scars or old parenchymal densities in this area.  The lateral view
 confirms the scoliotic deformity in the spine with poorly identified
 endplates, but normal appearance of the posterior pleural sinuses.  The depth
 diameter of the chest is relatively small.  When comparison is made with the
 next preceding chest examination of ___, the findings are stable
 and the skeletal deformity is unchanged.  There is no evidence of any acute
 specific pulmonary infection nor are there linear densities that would
 disclose apical scar formations related to previous tuberculous infection of
 the lungs.
