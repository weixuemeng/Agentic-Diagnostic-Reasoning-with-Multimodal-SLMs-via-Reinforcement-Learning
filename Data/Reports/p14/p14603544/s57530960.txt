                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ h/o R fem to PT bypass and multiple stents/PTA of L side
 now p/w nonhealing ulcer and erythema of L foot s/p angio ___  ___/ Please
 evaluate for fluid overload. Thanks     Please evaluate for fluid overload.
 Thanks
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently one
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated, consistent with emphysema.  Chain suture
 denotes prior resection from the left midlung. Irregularly shaped
 calcifications project over both lung apices have been present since at least
 ___.  It is not clear whether they are calcified granulomas or more
 bulky atherosclerotic calcifications in the subclavian arteries. Lateral view
 confirms heavy calcification at the origins of the branches of the aortic
 arch. A lordotic view of the chest would clarify the nature the apical
 calcifications.
 
 A 6 mm well-circumscribed nodular opacity projecting over the right fifth
 anterior interspace might be present on prior studies.  I would repeat
 conventional chest radiographs in 6 months to document its contain stability.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
