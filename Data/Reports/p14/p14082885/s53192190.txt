                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with catatonic schizoaffective disorder, no
 respiratory symptoms or WBC.  Any signs of pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph is provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low which limits the evaluation.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is crowding of
 the pulmonary vasculature but no signs of pulmonary edema.  A right chest wall
 port with catheter tip in the right atrium is new since the prior study.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes slightly limit assessment, but no focal
 consolidation.
