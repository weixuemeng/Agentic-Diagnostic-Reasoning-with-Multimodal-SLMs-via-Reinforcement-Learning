                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Sudden onset unresponsiveness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, with catheter terminating at the distal SVC. 
 There are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there may be very minimal interstitial edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with possible minimal interstitial edema.
