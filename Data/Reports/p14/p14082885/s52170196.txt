                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Schizophrenia with whole body pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung
 bases.  Additionally, the cardiac silhouette size is likely exaggerated by low
 lung volumes, but remains unchanged, and appears mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities in the lung base,
 this may reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Likely
 bibasilar atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
