                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus,
 hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with  altered mental status// please
 evaluate for evidence of infection, please evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction
 of the SVC and right atrium.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, accentuated by
 low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 crowding of bronchovascular structures without pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Infection,
 however, cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection, however, cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
