                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // eval ptx/pna, aortic contour
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Underinflation of the lungs makes it difficult to say whether interstitial
 abnormality is present. There is no mediastinal venous engorgement,
 cardiomegaly, or pleural effusion so I doubt that pulmonary edema is present.
 The mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suggest repeat radiographs it deeper inspiration to determine if the mild
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality is present. This is unlikely to be
 pulmonary edema and its chronicity is indeterminate.
