                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SDH, declining neuro exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 4.3 cm from the
 carina.  Orogastric tube courses into the stomach, with the tip off the
 inferior borders of the film. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is
 tortuous. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis but aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis but aspiration is not
 excluded.
