                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, CHF, hypercarbic respiratory failure, intubated.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:11 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present,  tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly, with evidence of enlarged pulmonary hila. 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, with diffuse
 pulmonary plethora and peribrinchial thickening, consistent with CHF.  
 Lucency projecting over the base of the heart raises the question of a hiatal
 hernia.  There is atelectasis at both bases.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and probable background COPD. Enlarged pulmonary arteries,
 raise question of background pulmonary hypertension, similar to prior.  
 2.  CHF findings with vascular plethora and mild interstitial edema which
 appears worse compared with ___.  No gross effusion.  
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank consolidation identified at this time.
 4. Suspected hiatal hernia.
