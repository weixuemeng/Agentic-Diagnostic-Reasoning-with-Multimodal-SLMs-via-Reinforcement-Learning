 EXAMINATION:  ___ through
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemia, unclear etiology, concern for
 aspiration  // Evaluate for interval change, pulm edema or new consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight increase in severe cardiomegaly could be due to differences in cardiac
 cycling as well as slight increase in cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 slightly more distended, but there is no pulmonary edema or focal
 consolidation. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Focal
 thickening of the right lateral costal pleura is due to adjacent chronic rib
 fractures, one not unhealed.
