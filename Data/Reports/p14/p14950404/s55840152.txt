                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Five days of generalized weakness with near syncope.  Found to
 have sepsis with elevated white cell count.  History of urinary tract
 infections.  New right internal jugular catheter placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular
 venous catheter.  The tip is slightly obscured by overlapping lead from
 pacemaker; however, appears to terminate in the low SVC.  A single-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is unchanged.Within the lungs, no focal opacity to
 suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is mild vascular congestion.  The heart size
 is top normal, unchanged.  Chain suture is noted in the left hemithorax with
 volume loss suggestive of prior resection.
 
 IMPRESSION: Central catheter in standard position without pneumothorax.
