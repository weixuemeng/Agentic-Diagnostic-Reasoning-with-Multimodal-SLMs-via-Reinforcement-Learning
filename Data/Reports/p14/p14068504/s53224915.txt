  1. Fracture through the lateral mass of C1 in close proximity to coarse of the

  2. Fracture through the dens(type II). There is increased soft tissue density
  posterior to the dens compared to CT c-spine in ___, which may represent a
  small epidural hematoma. There is no evidence of cord compression, CSF
  surrounds the spinal cord throughout its cervical course. 
  3. Fracture of the spinous process of C2.
  4. Fracture of the posterior left 1st rib.
