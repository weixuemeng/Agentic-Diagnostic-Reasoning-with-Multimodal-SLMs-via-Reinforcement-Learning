                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with COPD, status post
 intubation-extubation with new productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  As the two next preceding portable chest examinations of
 ___ were obtained to monitor the intubation and extubation, comparison
 is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits. 
 Unaltered appearance of thoracic aorta, mediastinal structures.  Again noted
 are the hyperinflated lungs with increased translucency in the bases
 coinciding with low positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms.  These
 findings are again consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD.  Comparison
 with examination of ___ and today demonstrates a few linear basal
 densities on the left side suggestive of peripheral plate atelectasis as well
 as local thickening of the major pleural fissure.  These findings consistent
 with a inflammatory re-activation in this area and a followup examination to
 document its resolution is recommended in about a week or two.
