                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, evaluate for infiltrate or acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear, without focal
 infiltrate, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is stable loss of volume
 within the left lung from prior resection.  The innumerable nodules seen on
 previous CT and PET-CT are not well characterized on this study.  However, a
 right upper lobe 4 mm nodule and smaller right lower lung nodule are seen on
 this study.  The heart size is top normal but unchanged.  Prominence of the
 interstium may relate to mild edema but is unchanged.  Apparent widening of
 the mediastinum is likely a result of persistent occlusion of the basal
 segment bronchi of the left lower lobe.  Thyroid clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
