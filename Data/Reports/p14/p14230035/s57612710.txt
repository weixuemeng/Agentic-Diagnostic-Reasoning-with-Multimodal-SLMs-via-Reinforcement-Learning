                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Neoplastic reduction in volume of the left hemithorax, with
 enlargement of the left hilus and left apical thickening as well as deviation
 of the esophagus to the left.  The presence of a small pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded.
 
 On the right, there is unchanged evidence of increased interstitial markings
 that might represent chronic bronchitis or lymphangitic spread.  The severity
 of the changes, however, is constant as compared to the previous examination.
 
 There are no newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  The overall size of the
 cardiac silhouette is constant.
