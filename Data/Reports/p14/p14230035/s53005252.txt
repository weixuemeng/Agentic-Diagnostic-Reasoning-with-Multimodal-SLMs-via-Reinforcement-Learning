                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated blood count.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, PET-CT ___, chest radiograph
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post partial resection of the left lower lobe with
 evidence of volume loss in the left hemithorax as evidenced by a leftward
 mediastinal shift and mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Chronic
 irregular pleural thickening of the left hemithorax is again noted, most
 pronounced within the left apex.  Opacities within the left upper
 paramediastinal region and medial aspect of the left lower lobe are compatible
 with known neoplastic lesions and are relatively unchanged compared to the
 prior study.  Multiple pulmonary nodules within the lungs are better assessed
 on the prior CT.  The right lung again demonstrates increased interstitial
 markings, relatively unchanged, without new focal consolidation.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated on the right. The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are no new osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior with no new areas opacification to
 suggest pneumonia.
