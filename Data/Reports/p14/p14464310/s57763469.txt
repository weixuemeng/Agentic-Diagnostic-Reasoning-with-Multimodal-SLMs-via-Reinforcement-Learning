                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD, increased shortness of breath, new Afib.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There may be trace pleural effusions.  Basilar atelectasis is noted
 without definite focal consolidation.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Flattening of the
 diaphragms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Relative lucency of the upper lobes is likely due to pulmonary emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, possible trace pleural
 effusions.  Basilar atelectasis.
 2.  COPD.
