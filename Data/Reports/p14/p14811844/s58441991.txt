                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MI.  // Comparison to previous     
 Comparison to previous
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study of ___ at 03:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine image of the chest is submitted. The lung bases and
 costophrenic angles are not entirely included on the study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given these limitations, bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis
 although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. A more focal nodular
 opacity at the right lung base most likely represents a nipple shadow and
 could be better assessed on followup imaging. There has been interval
 resolution of the mild interstitial edema seen on the previous study.  A
 densely calcified opacity at the left apex appears to be either related to the
 second anterior rib or be pleural in location when correlated with the
 ___ film study from ___ at 00:52.  Correlation with
 more remote studies would be helpful.
