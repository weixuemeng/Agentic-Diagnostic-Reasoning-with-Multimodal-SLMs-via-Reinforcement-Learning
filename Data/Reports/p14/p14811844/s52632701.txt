 INDICATION:  MI.  Evaluate for pleural effusions, pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP Chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged, even accounting for technique. Increased
 opacities at the right lung base could reflect atelectasis, however in the
 appropriate clinical setting an early infectious process or aspiration cannot
 be entirely excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly,. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Increased density at
 the right lung base could reflect atelectasis, however in the appropriate
 clinical setting an early infectious process or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.
