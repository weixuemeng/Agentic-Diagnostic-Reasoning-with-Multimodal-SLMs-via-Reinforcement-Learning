                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p pericardial drain placement  // r/o interval change, PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___,, ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A mediastinal drain is noted.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette size
 cannot be performed given extensive opacification of the left lung base due to
 a loculated pleural effusion and peribronchial consolidation, which appears
 worsened compared to prior. Opacity at the left apex is accounted for by
 loculated pleural effusion and known mass.  There is no right pleural
 effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The right lung is well aerated with
 increased interstitial markings, and small nodules better seen on CT. The
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Pericardial drain in place without pneumothorax.
 2.  Left basilar opacity representing loculated pleural fluid and
 peribronchial consolidation, worsened compared to prior.
