                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, altered mental status, concern for
 aspiration  // ? evidence of pneumonia      ? evidence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 08:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 21:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly although a
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  Left subclavian PICC line remains
 unchanged in position with its tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral
 parenchymal process with more consolidative components in both lung bases
 likely reflects a combination of pulmonary edema, pneumonia and or pulmonary
 hemorrhage.  Overall, the edema may have slightly improved.  Clinical
 correlation is recommended.  There is likely a layering left effusion.  No
 large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 diminished given supine technique.
