                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mild chronic obstructive asthma  // any
 change in upper lobe nodules. Has bronchiectasis infection that was treated in
 ___ and has been asymptomaic since
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tubular opacities extending upward from the left hilus have been present
 with very little change since ___.  I think this is probably a complex of
 dilated partially impacted bronchi. There may be other tiny impacted bronchi
 just inferior to it, but evaluation of all of these structures is more
 reliable on CT scanning.  Heart is top-normal size.
 
 Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet could be due either to
 a large and tortuous innominate artery or right thyroid nodule.
