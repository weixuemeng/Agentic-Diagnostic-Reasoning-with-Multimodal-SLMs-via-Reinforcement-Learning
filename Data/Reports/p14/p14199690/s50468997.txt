                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  The patient shows cardiomegaly after CABG.  The
 sternal wires are in correct position.  Better seen than on the previous
 examination is a retrocardiac atelectasis, projecting over the dorsal parts of
 the left dorsal sinus on the lateral radiograph.  Imaging within 24 hours
 should be repeated to exclude potential co-existing pneumonia.
 
 No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
