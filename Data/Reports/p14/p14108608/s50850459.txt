                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Bilateral areas of septal
 thickening have resolved since the prior study, and slightly confluent
 opacities in the lower lobes centrally have also improved.  Small pleural
 effusions are again demonstrated.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Resolution of interstitial edema.  Improving lower lobe opacities may
 reflect dependent edema and atelectasis but continued follow up radiographs
 may be helpful to ensure resolution given clinical concern for infection.
 
 2.  Persistent small pleural effusions.
