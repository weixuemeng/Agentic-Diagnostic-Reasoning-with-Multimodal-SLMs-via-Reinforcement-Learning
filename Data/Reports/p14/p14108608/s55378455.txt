                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Increased streaky opacities in the lung bases are new compared to the
 prior study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect mild pulmonary
 edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
