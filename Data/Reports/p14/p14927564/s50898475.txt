                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Hazy opacities in both lung bases,
 more so in the retrocardiac region are noted, with partial obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  There is
 no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 A slight S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine persists.
 
 IMPRESSION. Hazy bibasilar opacities, more pronounced on the left, are
 worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.
