                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease and lung
 cancer presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia versus
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___. 
 CT chest with contrast from ___ was also reviewed for
 comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has chronic underlying fibrotic changes with
 reticulation and honeycombing, most pronounced at the lung bases.  On this
 background, there is slightly increased opacification of the left mid lung
 field. Right mid and lower lung field patchy opacification seen on the most
 recent prior study appears slightly improved, perhaps suggestive of slight
 interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged from prior.  Chain sutures are seen along the left upper lung field,
 compatible with prior wedge resection.  There is no pneumothorax. Small left
 pleural effusion is unchanged  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased opacification of the left mid lung compared
 with the prior exams could suggest pneumonia. Superimposed mild interstitial
 edema on a background of diffuse fibrotic changes may be minimally improved.
