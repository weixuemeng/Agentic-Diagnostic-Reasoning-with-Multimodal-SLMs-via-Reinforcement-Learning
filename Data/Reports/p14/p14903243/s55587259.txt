                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Angina, shortness of breath.  Rule out pulmonary effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiographs from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Fibrotic changes with reticulation and honeycombing, most pronounced at the
 lung bases are again seen and are stable when compared to prior chest
 radiograph from ___. There is redemonstration of emphysematous
 changes. Increased left basilar opacity with blunting of the costophrenic
 sulcus could suggest a small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  There are no other areas of new focal
 opacification or pneumothorax.  Chain sutures are noted within the left upper
 lobe, compatible with prior wedge resection.   Tracheomegaly is again
 demonstrated. There are no acute osseous findings.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable small left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity
 likely reflecting atelectasis, though assessment is difficult given
 pre-existing chronic fibrotic changes in the lung bases.   No overt pulmonary
 edema.
