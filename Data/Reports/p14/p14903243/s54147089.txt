 INDICATION:  Known lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis.  Cough and hemoptysis. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
 change.  The patient has made a bigger inspiratory effort, resulting in larger
 lung volumes and overall increase in lung translucency.  Unchanged diffuse
 bilateral reticulations, combined to a small left pleural effusion and mild
 cardiomegaly.  No new parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 bilateral apical thickening.
