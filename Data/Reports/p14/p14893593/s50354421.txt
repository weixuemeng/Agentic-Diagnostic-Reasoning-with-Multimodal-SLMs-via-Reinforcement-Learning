                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ AT 4:21 P.M.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 3:01 p.m.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, intubated with right IJ placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  ET, enteric, and right PICC are
 in stable positions.  New right IJ line is seen with tip at the SVC/RA
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes again noted, with
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  More focal opacity at the left lung
 base is likely due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ central venous catheter at the RA/SVC junction.  No
 pneumothorax.
