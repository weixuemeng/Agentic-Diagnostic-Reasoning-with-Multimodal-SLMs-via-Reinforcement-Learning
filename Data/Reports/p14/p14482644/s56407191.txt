                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right hemidiaphragm is
 more sharply seen.  It is unclear whether this could reflect a more erect
 posture of the patient, or a decrease in the degree of pleural effusion. 
 Minimal atelectasis is above the elevated right hemidiaphragm.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  No definite vascular congestion.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
