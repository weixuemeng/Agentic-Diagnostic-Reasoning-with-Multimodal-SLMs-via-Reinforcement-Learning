                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of intubation, removed.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.8 cm above the level of
 the carina.  There are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, right greater
 than left with suggestion of air bronchograms seen in the retrocardiac region.
 Findings may be due to massive aspiration with atelectasis, although infection
 or pulmonary hemorrhage is not excluded.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue, though a trace
 effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by supine, AP technique, aortic knob
 calcification is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to massive aspiration,
 although diffuse infection or pulmonary hemorrhage or contusion not excluded.
