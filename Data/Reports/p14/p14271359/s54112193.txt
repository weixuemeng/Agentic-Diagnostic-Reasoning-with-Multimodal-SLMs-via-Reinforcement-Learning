                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The frontal view is not
 symmetrical and difficult to evaluate, but there is a vague patchy opacity in
 the lingula, although most likely due to minor atelectasis.  A nipple shadow
 is visualized on the right side.  Hemidiaphragms appear flattened suggesting
 hyperinflation.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity in the lingula, which is not specific as to
 etiology; pneumonia is not excluded, but the area is not well evaluated and
 opacity may be due to atelectasis.  Noting the technical limitations of the
 film followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful if pulmonary symptoms
 were to persist.
