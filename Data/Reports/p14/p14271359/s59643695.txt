 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New dyspnea, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have almost completely resolved.  However, the cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion on the frontal and
 lateral views.
