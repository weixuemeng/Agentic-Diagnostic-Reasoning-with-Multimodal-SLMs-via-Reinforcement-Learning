                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  On the frontal
 view, patient is slightly rotated to the left, which somewhat limits the
 valuation.  There is slight asymmetric opacity in the right lung relative to
 the left, which may in part be due to patient's rotation.  The possibility of
 mild edema is not excluded.  Top normal heart size.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited due to rotation with possible mild edema.
