                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p bronch  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of fine detail on this film is quite limited.  ET tube tip appears
 to lie at the upper edge of the clavicular heads, approximately 5.2 cm above
 the carina.  The NG tube is quite difficult to trace beyond level of lower
 esophagus.  There is a right subclavian PICC line.  Again, the tip is not
 distinctly visible.  No obvious pneumothorax.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low, with prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 similar to the prior study.  Diffuse opacity is present in both lungs. 
 Changes in the right lung are notably increased compared with ___
 at 01:10.  This is difficult to characterize could represent alveolar edema. 
 As before, there is increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm.  The left pleural sulcus is not well visualized.  No gross
 right effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes as described.  As noted, the distal NG tube and PICC line
 are not well delineated.
 2. Persistent cardiomegaly and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 3. Elsewhere, there is diffuse opacity.  In the right lung, this appears
 increased compared with ___ at 01:10, but is not clearly 
 characterized, ?  Alveolar edema, ?  Component of atelectasis or layering
 effusion
 4. Of note, the radiographic appearance is significantly worse and more
 difficult to assess than on the radiograph from ___.  If
 clinically indicated, chest CT may help to more completely delineate the
 nature of the abnormality and the  location of the lines/tubes.
