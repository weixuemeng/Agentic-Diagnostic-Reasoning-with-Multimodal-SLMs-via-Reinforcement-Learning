                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M obese, otherwise previously healthy, who was found to have
 large R parieto-temporal lobe mass, now s/p partial resection via R crani
 w/frozen path consistent with GBM and MRI showing multiple likely ischemic
 infarcts - acute desaturation with moving  // interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.3 cm above the carina, at the level
 of the upper clavicular heads.  Right IJ central line tip lies in the region
 of the SVC/RA junction.  An NG type tube is likely present, not well
 visualized.  It most likely extends beneath the diaphragm to overlie the
 proximal stomach, but a be more completely and better visualized on films
 obtained with the increased penetration.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is dense opacification of the mid
 and lower zones of left lung, with obscuration of the cardiac silhouette and
 hemidiaphragm.  This has clearly increased compared with ___ and
 ___.  Aside from minimal atelectasis in the right upper zone and
 possible minimal upper zone redistribution, the right lung is grossly clear,
 without focal consolidation or effusion.  Based on the appearance of the right
 heart border, the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely remains midline.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube 6.3 cm above the carina, relatively high.  Clinical correlation
 regarding possible advancement is requested.
 
 Dense opacification of the left mid and lower lung zones, of uncertain
 etiology.  Differential includes pleural effusion, consolidation, atelectasis
 or a combination thereof.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains grossly
 midline.
 
 Aside from possible minimal upper zone redistribution and minimal atelectasis
 at the right lung apex, the right lung is grossly clear, without effusion.
