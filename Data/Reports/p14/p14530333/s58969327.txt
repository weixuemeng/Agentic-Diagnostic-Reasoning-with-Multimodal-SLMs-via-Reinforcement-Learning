                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and
 hypoxemia.  Rule out infection
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 There is increased opacification of the right mid zone.  The right heart
 border is difficult to see but overall when compared to prior studies, there
 has been little interval change and on the lateral view, there is no good
 correlate to suggest definitive middle lobe process.  As before, extensive
 pericardial fat is noted, possibly with insinuation into the minor fissure.
 
 Degenerative changes in the spine.  Mild pulmonary hyperinflation.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 No definitive acute cardiopulmonary finding.
