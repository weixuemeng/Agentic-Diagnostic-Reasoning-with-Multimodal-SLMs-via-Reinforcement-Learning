 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subacute lateral left ninth rib fracture.  Recommend detailed view of the
 rib to assess for underlying pathologic lesion.
 2.  Retrosternal soft tissue only seen on lateral projection may represent a
 right middle lobe pneumonia or scarring.  Recommend oblique views to further
 assess.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1. Recommend detailed view of the rib to assess for
 underlying pathologic lesion.
 2. Recommend oblique views to further assess retrosternal soft tissue.
