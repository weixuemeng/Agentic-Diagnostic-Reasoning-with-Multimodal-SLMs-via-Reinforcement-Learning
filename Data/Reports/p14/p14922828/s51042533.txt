                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumoperitoneum.  Evaluate.
 
 REPORT:  A right-sided central line is new, with tip lies in the proximal SVC.
 NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum.  Its tip is not seen.  There are
 partially assessed stents, as well as new paracolic gutter and subhepatic
 drains on the right side.  There is still evidence of pneumoperitoneum, though
 this is significantly less than when compared to prior study, and is best seen
 along the right lateral and ans subhepatic spaces
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Improved pneumoperitoneum appearances.  New surgical drain is in position.
 
 There is unchanged bibasilar atelectasis.
