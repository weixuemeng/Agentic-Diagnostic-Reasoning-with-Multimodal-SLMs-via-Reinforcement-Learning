                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, fever, chills, HIV positive, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Diffuse reticular
 opacity which is new from prior exam and could reflect interstitial edema or
 less likely an atypical infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Heart size and mediastinal contour appear unchanged.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticular opacities could represent mild interstitial
 edema versus atypical infection.  Please correlate clinically.
