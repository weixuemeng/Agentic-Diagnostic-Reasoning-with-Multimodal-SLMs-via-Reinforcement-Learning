 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are
 unchanged and normal.  The parenchyma of the left lung also appears normal.
 
 On the right, however, there is an increase in density of the right upper
 mediastinal structures, with partial blunting of the paratracheal stripe. 
 Moreover, the lung parenchyma at the right medial lung bases appears slightly
 less transparent.  The changes have no correlate on the lateral image and
 could, therefore, be the effect of projection.  However, the radiograph should
 be performed in approximately two weeks to confirm or exclude the findings. 
 If findings persist, CT is recommended.
