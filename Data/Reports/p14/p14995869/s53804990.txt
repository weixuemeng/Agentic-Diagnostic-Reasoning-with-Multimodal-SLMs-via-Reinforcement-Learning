 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change.
 There is some increased opacification at the left base, though this is not

 suggestive of some mild atelectatic streaks in addition to normal pulmonary
 vessels.  No discrete pneumonia is appreciated.

 congestion or pleural effusion.
