                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle as well as an epicardial lead projecting over the left
 heart border, unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal contours similar.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is minimally
 improved from the prior study.  Small left pleural effusion is similar
 compared to the prior study with left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Multiple remote right-sided rib fractures are
 noted.  Marked degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, perhaps minimally improved, with small
 left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity which may reflect atelectasis,
 but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
