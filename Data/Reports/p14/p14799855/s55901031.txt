  Since the prior study performed earlier on the same date, there has been no
  significant interval change.
  Left pectoral pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
  Dense left retrocardiac opacity likely represent atelectasis, although
  infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small left
  pleural effusion.  No pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax.  At
  least moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the left
  lateral chest wall extends superiorly into the neck.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  patient with pneumothorax resolving on prior imaging with
 hypotension  // eval for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, a small left
 apical pneumothorax is newly visualized, possibly due to positional
 differences between the studies.  Small right pleural effusion and adjacent
 right basilar atelectasis have improved.  No other relevant change.
