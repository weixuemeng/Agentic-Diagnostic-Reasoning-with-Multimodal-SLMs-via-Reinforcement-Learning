                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple myeloma, currently D5 after Cy Bor
 D, admitted with nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness.  // Rule out PNA 
 Rule out PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is no interval change.  Again
 there are areas of opacification in the right upper and mid zones, which could
 be related to prior fractures.  Nevertheless, metastatic disease could not be
 excluded.
 Substantial pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis is again seen on the
 left.  Pacer leads are unchanged.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary and pleural changes, it would be difficult
 to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
