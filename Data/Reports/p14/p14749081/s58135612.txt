                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Liver transplant, workup, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal on the right, but slightly decreased on
 the left.  In addition, there is slight elevation of the hemidiaphragm.  The
 lateral radiograph shows a left basal plate-like opacity.  The morphology of
 the opacities suggestive of either metastasis or a parenchymal scar.  However,
 to rule out pneumonia, a followup radiograph or previous imaging should be
 provided for more detailed assessment.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
