                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent bleach and alkaline ingestion, with
 hematemesis.  Question mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  There is no confluent
 consolidation.  Overlying the left pulmonary hilum is a 3-mm hyperdensity
 without definite correlate on the lateral view.  This could potentially
 represent vessel seen en face, but appears more dense than expected.  This
 could be further assessed by oblique view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Incidental note of a tiny hyperdensity in the left hilum, which could
 potentially represent vessel seen en face, but is slightly more dense than
 expected, and could be further evaluated by oblique view.
