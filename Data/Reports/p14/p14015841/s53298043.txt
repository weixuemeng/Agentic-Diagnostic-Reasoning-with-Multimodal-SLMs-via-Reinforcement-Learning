  Endotracheal tube 4.2 cm above the carina. Bilateral internal jugular central
  lines terminate in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm
  within the stomach. Again seen is diffuse opacification of the lungs,
  unchanged. Stable small left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Semi supine portable chest
 
 INDICATION:  Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female, with past history of
 cirrhosis ___ EtOH, presnting with septic shock with MODS characterized as
 hypoxemic respiratory failure likely ARDS, with now oliguria now s/p CVL
 placement  // eval CVL
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi supine portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4.2 cm above carina.  Enteric tube extends to the stomach
 beyond lower aspect of the image.  Right IJ sheath and left IJ CVC terminate
 in the distal SVC. Fluffy bilateral alveolar opacities are overall similar to
 prior, likely reflecting pulmonary edema.  Slightly decreased blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle compared to prior.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval insertion of right IJ sheath and left IJ CVC, terminating in the
 distal SVC.
 
 Similar appearance of pulmonary edema. Possible mild interval improvement in
 probable left pleural effusion.
