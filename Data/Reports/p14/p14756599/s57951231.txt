 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal, however, likely exaggerated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal hilar
 contours are also unremarkable given low lung volumes. No displaced fracture
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
