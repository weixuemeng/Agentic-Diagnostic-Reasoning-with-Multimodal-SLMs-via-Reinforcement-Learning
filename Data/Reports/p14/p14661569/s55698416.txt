                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath after right partial
 nephrectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Nodular and linear opacities in the left
 lower lung may represent atelectasis or, less likely, mucoid bronchial
 impaction.  Right lower lobe opacity is more typical of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax or effusion is present.  Subcutaneous emphysema is visualized
 along the left flank.  There is mild prominence of the valvulae conniventes in
 a loop of small bowel in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Probable bilateral atelectasis.  Attention on followup x-rays to ensure
 resolution with better aeration.  
 2.  Mild questionable small bowel wall thickening in the left upper quadrant. 
 Correlate with any clinical symptoms.
