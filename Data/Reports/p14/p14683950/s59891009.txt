                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of lymphoma on chemotherapy presenting with fever and
 neutropenia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC has been intervally removed. Mild cardiomegaly with tortuosity of
 the aorta is unchanged. Mild central vascular prominence without interstitial
 edema. Indistinct left hemidiaphragm is unchanged, likely representing a
 combination of effusion and consolidation. No pneumothorax. Lungs otherwise
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged indistinct left hemidiaphragm with left base opacity likely
 representing a combination of effusion and consolidation, probably
 atelectatic.  Lateral view, if possible would be helpful for characterization.
 With only a frontal view, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical circumstance.
 2. Vascular congestion without interstitial edema.
