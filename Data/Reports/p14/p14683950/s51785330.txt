 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ___ pain, lymphoma  // ? free air under
 diaphragm
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison. Reference

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle. The left hemidiaphragm
 appears mildly elevated and there is subtle patchy left basilar opacity. The
 right lung is clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal. The mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. 
 No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle with left basilar opacity likely
 relates to a small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.
 
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
