 terminates at the level of the cavoatrial junction. The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  A sclerotic right rib and
 sclerosis of upper lumbar vertebrae is consistent with known metastatic
 osseous disease.  A right upper quadrant biliary stent is partially imaged.
