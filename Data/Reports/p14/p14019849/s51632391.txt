                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with peritonieal abd pain  // eval for free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen and terminates in the distal SVC as before. 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low. The heart is normal in size. There it is some
 bronchovascular crowding, likely related to low lung volumes. There are likely
 trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Note is made of a retrocardiac opacity,
 new from the prior exam. No large free air is seen on this semi-erect view. A
 biliary stent projects in the upper abdomen.  There is sclerosis involving a
 right sided rib and multiple thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No large free air seen on this semi-erect view. If there is high clinical
 suspicion for pneumoperitoneum, CT scan should be considered.
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity could represent
 atelectasis or infection. A lateral view may be helpful with full inspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  .
