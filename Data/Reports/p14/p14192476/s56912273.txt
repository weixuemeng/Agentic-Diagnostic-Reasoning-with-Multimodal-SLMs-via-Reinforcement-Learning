                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Please evaluate for Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which is coiled within the
 distal esophagus or possibly proximal stomach and travel back up the esophagus
 and out of view.  Wire is still in place.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is a minimal improved aeration of the bilateral
 lower lung bases likely due to decreased atelectasis and slightly smaller
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Atelectasis is also noted projected in right mid
 lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube coiled in esophagus and traveling up and out of
 view.  Minimally decreased small bilateral pleural effusions.  Stable mild
 cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary edema.
