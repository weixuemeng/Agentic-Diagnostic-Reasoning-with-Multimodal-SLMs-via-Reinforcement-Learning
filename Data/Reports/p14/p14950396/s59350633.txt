 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and end-stage renal disease with acute desaturations.
 
 Portable ___ radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including dilated mediastinum. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, are large, unchanged. 
 There is interval progression of right upper lobe opacities that might be
 consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infectious process,
 attention to this area on subsequent radiographs is recommended.
