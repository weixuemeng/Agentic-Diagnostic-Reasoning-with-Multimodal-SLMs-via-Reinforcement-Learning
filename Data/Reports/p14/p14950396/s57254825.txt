                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent respiratory distress.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam performed approximately 24 hours earlier,
 there has been ___decrease in the pulmonary edema.  Mild pulmonary edema
 persists.  ___small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. 
 Bilateral basilar atelectasis is stable.  The thoracic aorta is and tortuous

 jugular hemodialysis catheter also terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight decreased in mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.

 3.  Left PICC terminates in the right atrium.  To ensure placement in the low
 SVC, could be removed 3 to 3.5 cm.
