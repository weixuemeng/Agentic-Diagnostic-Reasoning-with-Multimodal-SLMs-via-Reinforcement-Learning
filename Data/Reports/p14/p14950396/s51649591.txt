                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains moderately
 enlarged, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with marked
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again demonstrated.  The thoracic aorta is
 also diffusely calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. 
 There are continued small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
 opacities, which may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified, and there are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interval change from prior with continued small bilateral
 pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities, which may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection would be difficult to exclude.
