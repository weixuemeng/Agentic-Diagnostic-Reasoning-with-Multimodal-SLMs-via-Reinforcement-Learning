                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath
 and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  Eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified
 and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed due to the
 bibasilar opacities, although does not appear enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
