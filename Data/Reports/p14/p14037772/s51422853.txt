 HISTORY:  Epidural abscess status post ET tube placement. 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE AP VW

 lie at the carina itself and should be retracted by about 1.5 to 2 cm.  NG
 tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  This likely accounts for the appearance of
 pulmonary vascular plethora.  There is prominent right aparatracheal opacity
 involving the medial portion of the riight upper zone. Otherwise, no frank
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.  There is atelectasis at the
 left lung base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent. Midline skin

 1) ET tube tip lies at the carina and should be retracted by approximately
 1.5-2 cm.  (Addendum: Mechanical ventilation discontinued on ___.)
 
 2) Prominent right paratracheal opacity - ? focal conslidation.
