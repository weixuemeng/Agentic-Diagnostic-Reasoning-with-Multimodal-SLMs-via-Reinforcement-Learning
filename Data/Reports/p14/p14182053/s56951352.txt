                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, and CT torso ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged, with minimal
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures due to stable volume loss in the
 right hemithorax.  Multiple chain sutures are demonstrated within the medial
 aspect of the right upper lobe, compatible with prior wedge resection.  Known
 right-sided peripheral pleural-based nodular opacities are better seen on the
 recent CT torso.  Mild emphysematous changes are noted within the lung apices.
 Scarring and/or atelectasis within the right lung base is unchanged.  Subtle
 patchy opacity within the left upper lobe also likely represents chronic
 scarring or atelectasis.  No new areas of focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax are demonstrated. The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax without evidence of
 pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
