 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:

 somewhat low.  Minimal increased opacity abutting the left heart border could
 represent a very early pneumonia.  Otherwise, lungs appear clear.  No
 congestion or edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.

 Very subtle opacity abutting the left heart border which in the correct
 clinical setting could reflect pneumonia.
