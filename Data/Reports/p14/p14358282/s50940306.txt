                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Extensive cardiac history, now with lightheadedness, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the prior study
 with mild streaky opacification of the bilateral lower lobes, most likely
 representing mild atelectasis.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged with a globular shape, which is unchanged
 from the prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no pulmonary
 edema.  A left pectoral pacemaker is in place with two leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
