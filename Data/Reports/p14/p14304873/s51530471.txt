                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cabg POD 4  // evaluate for effusion    
 evaluate for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved substantially since ___ with only moderate mild
 to moderate residual atelectasis at both lung bases. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are probably unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is a normal
 postoperative appearance.
 
 A constellation of ring shadows in the left supra hilar lung could be residual
 of unusual atelectasis, since the largest component was larger on ___. It
 could also be loculations of air and fluid in the anterior pleural space. I
 would pursue this with additional imaging only if the patient is symptomatic.
 In the absence of clinical findings, followup chest radiograph in 4 weeks is
 appropriate.
