                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___, 5:32 P.M.  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with worsening respiratory failure.  Evaluate for
 progression of ARDS.
 
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 10:18 a.m.:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and upper
 mediastinal widening all developed between ___ and ___.  Over the
 past 15 hours, lung volumes have improved, mediastinal widening presumably due
 to vascular engorgement has decreased, but there is new perihilar
 opacification in the right lower lung which could be developing pneumonia or
 dependent edema, and a severe left lower lobe atelectasis has not improved. 
 Small to moderate left pleural effusion persists.  Lines and tubes are in
 their standard placements, unchanged.  I see no pneumothorax.
