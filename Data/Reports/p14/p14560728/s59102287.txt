                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax. A pleural effusion is small. Mild left basilar atelectasis is
 improved.  Cardiac silhouette is stable. The mediastinal silhouette is
 slightly narrower after CABG than it was immediately post operatively.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or edema.
