                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm raising the possibility of worsening
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and increasing effusion.  Some of this may
 reflect the lower lung volumes.  There is also increasing fullness of
 pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of worsening congestion.
 
 The central catheter again extends to left brachiocephalic vein.  The tip of
 the Dobbhoff tube is not definitely seen on the current study.
