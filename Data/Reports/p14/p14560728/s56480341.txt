                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date as well as previous
 radiographs dating back to ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been recent median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
 surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for
 post-operative status of the patient and accentuation by low lung volumes and
 leftward rotation.  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard
 position, including a left-sided chest tube, with no visible pneumothorax. 
 Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are present, left greater than right, overall
 improved since the intraoperative radiograph of earlier the same date.
