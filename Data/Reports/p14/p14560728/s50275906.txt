                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute desaturation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from the same day
 at 00:38.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube appears stable at 5.6 cm from the carina.  The left chest tube appears
 in place.  Left-sided internal jugular central venous line appears unchanged. 
 
 
 There is a new opacity overlying the right upper lobe which is most likely
 representative of atelectasis/collapse.  The left basilar opacity appears
 slightly improved. Otherwise, there is little interval change in comparison to
 prior study with multiple postsurgical changes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New right upper lobe opacity suggestive of atelectasis/collapse.   
 
 2. Mild improvement in left base aeration.  Otherwise, little interval change
 in comparison to prior study from the same day.  
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ via telephone at
