                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Small lesion noted on chest x-ray.  Questionable increase in
 size.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in appearance of a pre-existing left lung nodule.  The constancy in appearance
 of this change suggests that the lesion should be worked up with CT, notably
 given the clinical background of COPD and the increased risk for a thoracic
 malignancy.  Unchanged signs of moderate overinflation.  Unchanged mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
