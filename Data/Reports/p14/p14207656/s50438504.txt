                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  PA and lateral chest x-ray, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD, follow up lung nodule.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is not enlarged.  The thoracic aorta remains widened
 with calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  Again noted is a
 small density in the left mid lung zone which has increased in size compared
 to the prior exam.  There remains irregular distribution of peripheral
 pulmonary vasculature and flattened diaphragms typical for COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of left mid lung zone nodule. 
 Especially given underlying COPD, CT scan is recommended for better
 characterization.
