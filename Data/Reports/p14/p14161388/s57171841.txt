                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with pain s/p fall  // evidence of fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs likely reflects underlying emphysema.  Mild basal
 atelectasis.  No convincing evidence of pneumonia or edema.   No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits and stable.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified as before. No
 rib fractures are identified however chest radiographs are not sensitive for
 the detection of nondisplaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No rib fractures.
