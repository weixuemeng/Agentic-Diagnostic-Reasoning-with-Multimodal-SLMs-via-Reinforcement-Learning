 for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  There is
 suggestion of areas of increased opacification at the bases that could
 represent aspiration, though they appear less prominent than on the previous
 study.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure in this patient with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Atelectatic changes are
 seen at the left base.
