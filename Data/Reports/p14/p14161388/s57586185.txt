                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted.  Both hila are unremarkable.  Heterogeneous
 peribronchial airspace opacity at both lung bases, right greater than left
 could be atelectasis, however developing pneumonia or sequelae of aspiration
 is a consideration in the correct clinical setting.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible aspiration or early pneumonia, both lung bases, right greater than
 left.  Heart size normal.  No pulmonary edema.
