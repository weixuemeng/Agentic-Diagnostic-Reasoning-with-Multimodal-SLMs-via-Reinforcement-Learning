                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and question of pneumoediastinum on
 recent prior chest radiograph, here for further evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate. The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar structures are within normal limits.  There is no pneumomediastinum.
 Subtle lucency along the posterior margin of the trachea and middle
 mediastinum may represent superimposed shadows although pneumomediastinum
 cannot be entirely excluded. The trachea is midline. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumopericardium. Subtle linear lucencies on the lateral view may
 represent superimposed shadows but pneumomediastinum cannot be entirely
 excluded.
