                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and weakness.  Evaluate for
 evidence of an infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Thoracic spine radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a conspicuity of the
 interstitial markings  with reticular opacities more pronouced in the lung
 bases which is not significantly changed from prior radiographs.  No focal
 parenchymal opacities are present. A prominent epicardial fat pad is noted in
 the right and is unchanged from prior.  The heart is moderately enlarged with
 significant left atrial contribution, unchanged from prior.  Otherwise, the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The azygos vein is not
 prominent and there is no apical vascular redistribution. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Although this appearance can be seen with interstitial edema,
 chronic reticular opacities in the lung bases without other signs of vascular
 congestion or edema are more suggestive of chronic interstitial lung disease
 in the setting of stable moderate cardiomegaly.
