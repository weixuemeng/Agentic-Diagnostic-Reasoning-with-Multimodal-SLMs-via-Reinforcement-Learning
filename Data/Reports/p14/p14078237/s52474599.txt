                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right lower lobe biopsy.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ill-defined nodule in the right lower lobe corresponds to the
 biopsied spiculated nodule, better characterized on the PET-CT.  A new clip is
 present.  There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Interstitial abnormalities and hyperinflation are likely
 related to emphysema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New clip in the right lower lobe spiculated nodule.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.
