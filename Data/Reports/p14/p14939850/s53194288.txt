 predominantly peribronchial and could reflect non-recent infection.
 
 Otherwise the radiograph is unchanged.  There is no evidence of other
 infectious foci.  No pleural effusions.  No parenchymal opacities suggesting
 malignancy.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
