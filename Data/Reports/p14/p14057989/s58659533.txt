                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper quadrant pain after falling off a chair.  Evaluate for a
 rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is no displaced rib
 fracture.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. 
 A calcified left upper lobe granuloma is unchanged.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged, with obvious enlargement of the right atrium.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Multilevel degenerative changes seen throughout an
 osteopenic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: No displaced rib fracture.  If concern for a fracture persists, a
 dedicated rib series with markers would be of utility.
