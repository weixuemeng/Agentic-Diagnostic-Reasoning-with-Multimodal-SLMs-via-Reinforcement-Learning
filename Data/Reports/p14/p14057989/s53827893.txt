                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the previous examination there is increased diffuse interstitial
 opacities with a linear consolidation in the right lower lung compatible with
 atelectasis. There is also a focal opacity in the left for lower lung and
 retrocardiac region, with associated small pleural effusion better seen in the
 lateral view.  Calcified granulomas are redemonstrated, more prominently in
 the left apex. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Rightward deviation of the
 trachea is also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the left lower lung and retrocardiac region may represent
 left lower lobe pneumonia on the background of interstitial pulmonary edema.
