                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears at least mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low.  Within the
 limitations of technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable aside from noting calcification along the aortic arch. 
 Subpulmonic pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  Chin flexion obscures
 the left apex.  However, aside from suspicion for retrocardiac opacification
 which would commonly be due to atelectasis, elsewhere the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected retrocardiac opacity although commonly this would be due to some
 degree of atelectasis.
