                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  In particular, there is substantial enlargement of
 the right atrium which appears to be unchanged since the prior study as well
 as global enlargement of the heart.  There is evidence of calcified left upper
 lobe granuloma, unchanged.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Osteopenia is suspected on the lateral view.
 
 Specifically, there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
