                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, though this is not
 significantly changed from ___.  There may be some increased
 atelectasis in the left lung base. There is new retrocardiac opacity
 suggesting pneumonia.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A
 prosthetic aortic valve is again noted.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal
 in size, and unchanged compared with prior.  The mediastinal contours are
 notable for surgical clips and calcification of the aortic knob.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic left basal opacity likely reflects atelectasis which may
 be slightly worse in the interval, with new retrocardiac opacity consistent
 with pneumonia.
 
 This change in the original read was discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:40am by
 phone.
