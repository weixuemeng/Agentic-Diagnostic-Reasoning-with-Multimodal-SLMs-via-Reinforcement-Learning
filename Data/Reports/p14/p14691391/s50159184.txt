 PORTABLE CHEST ___ WITH COMPARISON STUDY OF EARLIER THE SAME DAY
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is limited by submaximal inspiratory level and respiratory
 motion.  The latter mostly affects the lung bases.  With this limitation in
 mind, there are no definite new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence
 of pneumonia, but repeat radiograph with improved technique would be helpful
 when the patient's condition permits.
