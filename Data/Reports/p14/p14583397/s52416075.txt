                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain.  Assess for PNA, effusion, infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  Heterogeneous right
 lower lobe opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Persistent mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Mediastinal contour
 and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right basilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  Followup PA and
 lateral radiographs may be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude the
 possibility of an early infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
