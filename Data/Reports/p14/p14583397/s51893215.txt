                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Right IJ central line.  Evaluate line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed ___, two hours prior.  
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  A new right internal jugular line ends at
 the cavoatrial junction.  The lung volumes remain low, which causes crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  No pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The heart size is top normal. 
 Percieved widening of the mediastinum is likely due to technique.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right internal jugular line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 No pneumothorax.
