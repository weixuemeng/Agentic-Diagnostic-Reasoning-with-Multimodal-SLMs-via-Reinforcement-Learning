                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recurrent weakness, recent admission for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Severe cardiomegaly is similar compared to the
 prior study.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions, the
 latter of which appears increased from the prior study.  Right upper lobe
 calcified granuloma is similar.  Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures with multiple compression fractures at the thoracolumbar junction
 appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and increased size of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis
 however infection cannot be completely excluded.
