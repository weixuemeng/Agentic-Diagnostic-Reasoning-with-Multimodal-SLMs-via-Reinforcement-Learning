                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p arrest  // eval for ett placement, ich
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses to the body of the stomach.  Note is also made of a right
 IJ catheter.
 
 Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals pronounced alveolar opacities in a
 perihilar distribution, right greater than left, likely representing pulmonary
 edema.  There is no sizable pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminates 3.3 cm above the carina.
 2. Pronounced alveolar opacities in a perihilar distribution likely represents
 pulmonary edema.  Given normal appearance of the heart, non-cardiogenic
 pulmonary edema is a potential consideration.
