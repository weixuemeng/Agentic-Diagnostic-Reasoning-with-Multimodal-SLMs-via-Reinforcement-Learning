                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post fall for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly normal.  There is heavy
 tracheobronchial calcification.  The lungs appear grossly clear.  Lateral view
 would suggest presence of pectus carinatum deformity.  No definitive acute
 finding in the visualized osseous structures.

 calcification.  No acute cardiopulmonary finding.
