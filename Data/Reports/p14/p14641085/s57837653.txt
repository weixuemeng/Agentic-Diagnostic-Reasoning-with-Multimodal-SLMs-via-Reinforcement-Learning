                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left hilus is mildly lobulated, lumen of the left main bronchus is
 obscure,  and the lower trachea is indented more than the degree expected by
 aortic deflection. These findings should be evaluated by Chest CT (with
 intravenous contrast, if tolerated) to look into possible malignancy.  
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and mediastinal venous dilatation are mild, but
 there is no edema or pleural effusion and heart size is normal for the AP
 projection. 
 
 AICD leads project end in the right atrium and right ventricle. Sternotomy
 wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Suggest Chest CT for possible central malignancy.
 Pulmonary vascular dilatation, could be chronic or acute congestion.
 
 Dr ___ was paged to discuss these findings.
