                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation, ET tube change, evaluate placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:56 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present.  The carina itself is not well seen, but the ET tube
 probably lies approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There does appear to be an
 additional tube that cannot be traced beyond at the level of the lower
 trachea.  Clinical correlation is requested.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy
 wires.  Mild prominence of the vascular markings is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube approximately 3 cm above the carina.  If an NG tube is present,
 then it does not extend below the level of the lower trachea.  Clinical
 correlation requested. 
 
 2.  Otherwise, I doubt significant change, allowing for technical differences.
