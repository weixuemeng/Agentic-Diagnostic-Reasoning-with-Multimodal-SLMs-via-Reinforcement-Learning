                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and chills with long smoking history.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are vague
 areas of increased opacification at the bases and most likely reflect some
 atelectatic change.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia could be considered.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Of incidental note is an
 azygous fissure, of no clinical significance.
