 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:25 PM
  Decreased size of previously moderate right pleural effusion status post
  thoracentesis.  No pneumothorax.  New lucency along the left mediastinal
  border likely represents aerated lung in between 2 loculated pleural
  effusions, exaggerated by patient rotation.  Increasing pneumomediastinum
  since ___:___ is less likely.  A repeat exam with more accurate AP positioning
  may be performed for confirmation.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ ___
  phone at ___.
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 8:08 PM
  Decreased size of previously moderate right pleural effusion status post
  thoracentesis.  No pneumothorax.  Left-sided pneumomediastinum has increased
  since the prior study at 08:00 but may be exaggerated by patient rotation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post primary repair and gastric patch.  Rule out acute
 changes in the lung parenchyma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:43.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 right thoracocentesis.  The effusion on the right has substantially decreased.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Right atelectasis persists.  The
 lucency on the left corresponds to an aerated lung portion, as documented on
 the previous CT examination.  The left chest tube is in unchanged position. 
 Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
