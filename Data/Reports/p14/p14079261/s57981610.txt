 esophagus.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  An
 endotracheal tube is positioned low with the tip projecting 1 cm cranial to
 the carina.  A left subclavian central venous catheter is in place with the
 tip projecting over the high right atrium.  Two left pleural drainage
 catheters are in place, one at the apex and one at the base.  There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions which are improving as well as bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is continued improvement of
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Vascular congestion has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Two left chest tubes in place without evidence of pneumothorax, with
 continued improvement of subcutaneous emphysema.
 2.  Improving bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Recommend withdrawal of endotracheal tube by 1-2 cm.
