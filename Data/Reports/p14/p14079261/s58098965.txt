 INDICATION:  Patient with Boerhaves, now left thoracotomy, primary repair of
 esophagus, intercostal and gastric patch, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___, outside hospital CT
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 ET tube is too low, ending 9.2 mm above the carina, suggest pulling it back 2
 cm.  The side port of the NG tube is at gastroesophageal junction.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Moderate subcutaneous air has decreased since previous exam.
 Left subclavian line ends at cavoatrial junction.  There are unchanged small
 bilateral pleural effusions. However, there are increased left lower lung
 opacities which are non-specific.  The patient had prior sternotomy for CABG. 
 Mildly enlarged cardiac contour is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 
 1.  ET tube is low, suggest repositioning.
 2.  There is no pneumothorax.
 3.  Increased left lower lung opacities are non-specific and could represent
 atelectasis, aspiration or developing pneumonia.
