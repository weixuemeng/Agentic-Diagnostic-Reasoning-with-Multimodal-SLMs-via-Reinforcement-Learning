                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post Boerhaave syndrome with
 repair of esophagus.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 The patient's condition required examination in sitting upright position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  There is status post sternotomy
 as before.  The heart is moderately enlarged without typical configurational
 abnormality.  Presence of multiple surgical clips indicates status post bypass
 surgery.  Left-sided PICC line is identified, seen to terminate in the upper
 third of the right atrium.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is
 evidence of remaining left-sided pleural thickening, probably representing
 pleural effusion.  Whereas the lateral pleural sinus is only mildly blunted,
 the density occupies a major portion of the posterior pleural sinus.  The
 previously existing right-sided pleural effusion has regressed markedly and
 only a mild blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus remains.  The
 posterior pleural sinus on the right side appears free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC line reaching upper third of the right atrium
 similar as on chest examination of ___.  Previously described
 bilateral pleural effusion regressed markedly on right side, moderate amount
 in posterior pleural sinus remaining on the left.  Considering interval of
 almost three weeks, it may be useful to perform a left-sided decubitus
 examination to evaluate if free fluid remains or densities have been
 organized.
