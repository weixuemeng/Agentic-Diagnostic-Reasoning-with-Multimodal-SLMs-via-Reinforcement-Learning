                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Boerhaave status post repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and unchanged from prior
 study.  Postoperative mediastinal contour is unchanged with median sternotomy
 wires and surgical clips in place.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Previous
 Boerhaave's repair is identified with gastric bubble seen superior to the
 diaphragm compatible with a gastric fundal flap as well as a left-sided
 intercostal flap.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with visualization of esophageal
 repair.
