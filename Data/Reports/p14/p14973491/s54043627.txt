                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus and pleural thickening
 appear unchanged and probably chronic.  In the right lower hemithorax, there
 is a patchy geographic opacification that may be associated with pleural but
 perhaps parenchymal scarring.  However, the appearance is unchanged without
 evidence for superimposed acute disease.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change.  Areas of scarring and pleural thickening
 at the level of the base of each hemithorax, but without evidence for
 superimposed acute disease.
