                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with left sided chest pain, history
 of pericarditis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, unchanged.
 Increased opacity in the left lower lobe since ___is best appreciated on
 the lateral view and may reflect atelectasis with slight persistent elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 The heart remains enlarged, similar to the prior exam with notable left atrial
 enlargement.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Prominence of the
 left upper mediastinum with displacement to the right of the trachea and mild
 narrowing of the trachea is unchanged and compatible with known goiter better
 appreciated on the prior CT Chest.
 Degenerative changes in the shoulders are similar.  Mild dextroconvex
 scoliosis of the thoracic spine with associated distortion of the chest cage
 are similar.  There is eventration of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increased left lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation.
 
 2.  Persistent cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Unchanged appearance of the left upper mediastinum secondary to goiter
 best appreciated on prior CT.
