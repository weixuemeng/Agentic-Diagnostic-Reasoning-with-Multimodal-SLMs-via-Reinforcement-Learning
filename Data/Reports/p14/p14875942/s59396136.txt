                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and cough, assess for pneumonia joint.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low lung volumes with vascular engorgement and thickened
 septal lines compatible with acute congestive failure.  In this context,
 assessment for focal consolidation is limited.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 likely present.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 heart is stably enlarged with a single-lead pacer unchanged in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate congestive failure.  If concern for infectious
 process, consider diuresis and repeat imaging to assess for subtle pneumonia.
