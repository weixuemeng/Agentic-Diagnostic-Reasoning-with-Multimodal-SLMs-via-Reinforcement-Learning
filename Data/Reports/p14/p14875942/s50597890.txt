                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are decreased,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette, which however still remains significantly
 enlarged.  Increased retrocardiac opacity likely refelcts atelectasis. There
 is no overt pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion. A right ventricular pacemaker and adjacent epicardial
 leads are in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia. Increased retrocardiac opacity
 likely reflects atelectatic changes.
