                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lung lesion and productive cough.  No fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest compared to multiple previous
 exams including chest CTs dating back to ___, most recent chest
 x-ray from ___.  The known lung mass is again seen in the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe.  Trace right-sided pleural effusion is
 identified.  Previously identified right basilar opacity has improved,
 potentially due to resolved infection or atelectasis.  There is some linear
 opacity at the left lung base laterally, also potentially due to atelectasis. 
 Vague opacities in the right mid lung can be atributed to healing posterior
 seventh and eighth rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity again suspicious for malignancy.  Trace
 right effusion.  Bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis; however,
 clinical correlation would be necessary to exclude infection.
