                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post fall.  Patient with rib fractures.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study CT, ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the
 right side have minimally increased from prior.  Left upper lobe opacity has
 increased.  At this level, the patient had a mass worrisome for malignancy,
 better seen on prior CTs.  Markedly increased opacity in the right lower lobe
 could be due to atelectasis, a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion
 and/or aspiration.
