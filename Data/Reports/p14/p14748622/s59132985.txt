                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia and poor quality chest x-ray from last
 night  // Is there a pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Again
 seen is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are low but improved from the prior
 study. Streaky opacities at the base of the right and left lung likely
 represent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and streaky
 opacities at the lung bases most likely representing atelectasis.
