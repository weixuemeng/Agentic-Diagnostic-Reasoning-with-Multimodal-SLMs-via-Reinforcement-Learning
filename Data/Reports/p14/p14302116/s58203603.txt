                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with epigastric and chest pain, vomiting
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely aches accentuated due
 to the presence of lower lung volumes compared to the prior chest radiograph. 
 The aorta remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Linear opacities in the lingula and left lower lobe likely
 reflect areas of scarring.  Calcified granuloma within the right middle lobe
 appears unchanged.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Linear scarring within the lingula and
 left lower lobe.
