                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral mastectomy with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Again there are bilateral breast implants with surgical clips.  No evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 Small areas of opacification are seen adjacent to the fifth and sixth anterior
 ribs on the right, presumably related to healing fractures.  Whether these
 could reflect pathologic fractures could not be determined on this study.
