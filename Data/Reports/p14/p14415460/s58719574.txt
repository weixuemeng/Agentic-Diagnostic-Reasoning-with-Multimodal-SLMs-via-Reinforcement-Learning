                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o pneumonectomy, COPD, here for COPD
 exacerbation requiring intubation. Now s/p extubation, with worsening
 respiratory status.  // Evidence for pulmonary edema or aspiration?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, the patient has been extubated. Left
 pneumonectomy changes are stable.  Combined interstitial lung disease and
 emphysema in the remaining right lung is similar to the prior study.
 Superimposed and at slightly worsening heterogeneous alveolar process in the
 periphery of the right lower lung could reflect a developing pneumonia and is
 accompanied by bronchial wall thickening.
