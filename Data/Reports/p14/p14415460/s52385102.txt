                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Complete
 opacity of the left hemithorax is in this patient status post left
 pneumonectomy with post-surgical changes along the left chest wall, similar to
 prior.  There is associated significant volume loss.  There may be mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion of the right lung, improved since the prior with
 underlying pulmonary emphysema.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not assessed due to its shift into the left hemithorax and
 overlying left hemithorax opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post left pneumonectomy with stable post-surgical changes.
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, which is improved since the prior
 study, with underlying pulmonary emphysema.  No focal consolidation.
