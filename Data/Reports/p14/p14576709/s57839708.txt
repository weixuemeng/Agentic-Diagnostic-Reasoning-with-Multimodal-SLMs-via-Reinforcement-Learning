 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, question aspiration.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked increase in the opacity in the right mid and lower
 lung.  Part of this is due to volume loss; part may be due to an infiltrate in
 the region of the known lung mass.  There is also increased opacity in the
 left lower lung, consistent with volume loss/infiltrate.  The pulmonary
 nodules are again seen bilaterally.  Left-sided densely calcified pleural
 plaque is again seen.
