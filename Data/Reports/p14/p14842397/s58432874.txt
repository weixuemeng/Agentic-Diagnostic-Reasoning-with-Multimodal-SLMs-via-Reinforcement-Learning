 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post mediastinal chest tube removal and low oxygen
 saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the single right and left
 chest tube remain in situ, as is the right PICC line.  All other monitoring
 and support devices have been removed.  The image shows no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low and lateral areas of basal atelectasis
 are seen.  Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  No
 focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
