                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left pneumothorax can no
 longer be definitely identified.  Post-cardiac surgery changes are again seen.
 Bibasilar opacifications consistent with atelectasis are stable and more
 prominent on the right.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle persists.
