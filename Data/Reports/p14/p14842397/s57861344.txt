 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference outside scan from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of right diaphragm elevation, combined to a right basal parenchymal opacity. 
 Reason for this opacity could be both atelectatic and infectious.  Overall,
 the opacity is slightly increased in extent as compared to the previous image.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with signs of mild fluid overload. 
 No pleural effusions or other pathological findings.  No pneumothorax.
