                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New chest pain in a patient status post laparoscopic rectopexy
 for rectal prolapse.  Evaluate for free air or other respiratory process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs which are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is no obvious
 intraperitoneal free air, although this does not appear to be an entirely
 upright radiograph, which limits evaluation. Gaseous distention of bowel is
 noted in the visualized upper abdomen.  Lucency in the subcutaneous soft
 tissues is likely subcutaneous emphysema related to recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. This does not appear to be in entirely upright radiograph, which limits
 evaluation of intraperitoneal free air.  Within these limitations, there is no
 obvious large amount of intraperitoneal free air.  If clinically indicated, a
 repeat radiograph in a true upright position or left lateral decubitus view
 can be obtained.
 2. Subcutaneous emphysema in the abdominal and lower chest walls is likely
 related to recent surgery.
