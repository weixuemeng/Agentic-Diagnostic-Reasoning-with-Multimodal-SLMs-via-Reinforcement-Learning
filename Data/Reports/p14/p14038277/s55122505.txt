                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question wide mediastinum or effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours appear
 within normal limits.  There is no mediastinal widening radiographically. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear aside
 from patchy left perihilar and infrahilar opacity which is suspected to
 reflect slight atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Small
 anterior osteophytes are present along the anterior lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left mid to lower lung opacity, probably due to minor
 atelectasis.
