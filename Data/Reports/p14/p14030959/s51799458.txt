                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of HIV, meningitis, and recently treated pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a
 semi-upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse, bilateral airspace opacities, more severe on the
 left than the right.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 identified.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse, bilateral airspace disease highly suggestive of
 pneumonia. In the setting of immunocompromise, PCP pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
