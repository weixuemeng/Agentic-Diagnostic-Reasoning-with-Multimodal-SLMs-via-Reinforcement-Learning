                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with complete heart block // assess for
 interval change and pacer lead placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen are small bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  However, superimposed infection could be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is evidence of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. A pacemaker is in place with the leads in the
 expected position in the right atrium and right ventricle. The
 cardiomediastinal contour is slightly improved. There is no pneumothorax. A
 pericardial drain projects over the cardiac silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis and pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 2. A pacemaker is in place with leads in the expected positions in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal contour is slightly
 improved.
