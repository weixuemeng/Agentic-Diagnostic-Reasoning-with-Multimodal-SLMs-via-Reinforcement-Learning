                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 HCC, confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Paraseptal emphysema is
 re- demonstrated, most pronounced at the lung apices, as well as increased
 interstitial markings predominantly along the periphery of both lungs,
 compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Embolization coil is seen within the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic changes with no focal consolidation to suggest infection.
