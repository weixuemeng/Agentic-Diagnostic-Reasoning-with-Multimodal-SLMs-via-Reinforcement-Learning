                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.  Study is read in conjunction with CT of the abdomen from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The previously
 demonstrated bilateral bullae and changes consistent with severe emphysema are
 redemonstrated.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There are increased interstitial markings, which could be a
 component of volume overload.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 since the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  Prominent interstitial markings
 could represent a component of volume overload in the setting of preexisting
 emphysema.
