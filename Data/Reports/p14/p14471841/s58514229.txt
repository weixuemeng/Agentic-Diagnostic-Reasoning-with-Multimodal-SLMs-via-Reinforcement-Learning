                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post TACE with fever, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes have decreased since the previous study. Multiple
 bullae in the upper lobes and increased interstitial markings in the lower
 lobes reflect emphysema.  Increased opacity in the mid right lung, suggesting
 consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe or superior
 segment of the lower, could be pneumonia, but is not clearly corroborated on
 the lateral view.  Heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  No pleural abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic emphysema.  Suggest oblique radiographs to evaluate
 possible right pneumonia.
 
 Note: Dr. ___ ___ the findings with Dr. ___ by telephone at
 11:45 am on ___.
