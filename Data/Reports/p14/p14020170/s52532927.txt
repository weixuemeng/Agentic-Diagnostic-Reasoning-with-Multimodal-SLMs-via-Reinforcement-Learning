                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pedal edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged with the left ventricular predominance.  The
 aorta is tortuous and demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications.  Hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is minimal upper zone vascular
 redistribution suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No overt
 pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Minimal atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt
 pulmonary edema.
