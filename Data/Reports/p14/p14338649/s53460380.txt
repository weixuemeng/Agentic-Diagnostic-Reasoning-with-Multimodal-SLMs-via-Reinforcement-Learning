                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, raising concern for tuberculosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in conjunction with a chest and
 trachea CT, ___.
 
 Atelectasis or linear scarring is present at both lung bases.  Mediastinal fat
 obscures the right and left heart borders on the frontal view.  Upper lungs
 are perfectly clear.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central
 adenopathy.  Heart size, exaggerated by low lung volumes, is probably normal. 
 Altogether, there are no findings to suggest infection, tuberculosis or
 otherwise.  The airway inflammation could explain the poor aeration at the
 lung bases, but before embarking on chest CT scan, I would obtain a repeat
 chest radiograph, encouraging optimal inspiration.  Is there any evidence of
 airway obstruction or inflammation?
