                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, history of pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to the
 ___.
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Bibasal opacities are
 noted, new as compared to the prior study, in particular in the left lower
 lung and might be concerning for new pneumonia.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is not associated with pleural effusion, most likely
 representing thickening of the pleura.
 
 Followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy
 is recommended for documentation of the resolution of pneumonia.
