 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New tachypnea and hypoxia, evaluation for edema or pneumonia.

 subtle remnant opacities at the bases of the right upper lobe.  No pulmonary
 opacities have newly appeared.  No pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal
 structures.  No evidence of pleural effusions.
