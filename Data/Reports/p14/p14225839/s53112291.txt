                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT torso completed on the same day at 18:55 and
 outside hospital chest radiograph from 14:20 on ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A subtle ground-glass and nodular opacity is
 visualized within the region of the right upper lobe and corresponds with
 findings seen on recent outside hospital chest CT.  Appearance is nonspecific,
 but could represent focus of infection or aspiration in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No other confluent opacity is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 calcification of the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right upper lung ground-glass nodular opacity, better
 characterized on recent outside hospital chest CT.
