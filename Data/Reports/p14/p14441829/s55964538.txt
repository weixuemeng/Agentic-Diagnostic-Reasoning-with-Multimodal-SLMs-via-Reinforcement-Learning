                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p polytrauma with small R apical PTX s/p chest tube  //
 eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Chest x-ray from ___.  Note made of outside
 scanned-in chest x-ray and CT from___ dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube is present.  Compared to the outside chest x-ray from
 ___, a slight curve is noted in the chest tube.
 
 There is new semi lunar opacity projecting over the mid/lower lung as well as
 fluid tracking along the right chest wall and into the right lung apex, which
 has increased compared with the prior film.  There is also residual lucency at
 the right lung base.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 There is pleural fluid at the left lung apex which has increased.  Possible
 minimal pleural fluid fluid or thickening along the left inferior chest wall
 and into the left costophrenic angle.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung
 base.  No gross left consolidation.
 
 The patient has known rib fractures, better depicted on the ___
 chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube again seen.
 
 New/ increased pleural fluid extending along the right chest wall, into the
 right lung apex.  Semi lunar density over the right lung base could represent
 fluid in the minor fissure or alternatively, a collapsed lung segment.  If
 clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for further characterization.
 
 Lucency at the right lung base is again noted, compatible with the patient's
 known pneumothorax.
 
 Pleural fluid tracking along the left chest wall and into the left lung apex
 is also increased compared with the prior film, though is less pronounced than
 in the right chest.  No left-sided pneumothorax detected.
