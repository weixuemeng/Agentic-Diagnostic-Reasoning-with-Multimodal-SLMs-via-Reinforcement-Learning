 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC w/ right-sided PTX, s/p chest tube
 clamping  // s/p right chest tube clamping, evaluate pneumothorax, standing
 expiratory film      s/p right chest tube clamping, evaluate pneumothorax,
 standing expiratory film
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  With the
 right chest tube in place, there is again a dense area of opacification in the
 region of the minor fissure.  A very lucent region is seen in the inferomedial
 aspect of the right hemithorax, suggesting a a loculated pneumothorax.
 The left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen, raising the possibility of a small
 left effusion with compressive atelectasis.
