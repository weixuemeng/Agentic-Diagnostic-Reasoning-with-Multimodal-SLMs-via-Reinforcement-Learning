 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, there has been interval
 removal of a right-sided chest tube.  No pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain
 low.  Opacity along the minor fissure, likely reflecting right middle lobe
 collapse, has minimally decreased.  Right basilar atelectasis has improved. 
 Small left pleural effusion with associated left basilar atelectasis is
