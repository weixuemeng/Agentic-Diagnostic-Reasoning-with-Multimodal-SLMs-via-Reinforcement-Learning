                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, sputum production and right lower lung
 opacity.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is stable.  There is still present left
 lower lung opacity, adjacent to the left ventricle border, most likely
 representing atelectasis seen on the prior CT torso.  The right lower lung is
 essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left lower lung opacity, most likely reflecting area of atelectasis
 but given patient's history, reevaluation with chest CT might be considered.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
