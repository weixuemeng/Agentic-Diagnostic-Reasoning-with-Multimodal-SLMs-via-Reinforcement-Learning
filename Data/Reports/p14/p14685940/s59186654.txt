                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new hypoxemia.  // pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ ends in the region of the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  The
 right lower lung opacity has significantly improved, with minimal residual. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is overall unchanged.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle and retrocardiac opacity with blunting of the left
 hemidiaphragm are overall unchanged and may suggest atelectasis and trace
 pleural effusion.  However, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No pneumothorax.  Severe scoliosis of visualized spine with
 resulting asymmetry of the chest wall is overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in right lower lung opacity with very minimal residual
 opacity.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
