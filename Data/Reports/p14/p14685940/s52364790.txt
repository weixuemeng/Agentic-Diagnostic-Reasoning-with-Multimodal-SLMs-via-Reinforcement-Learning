                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hematoma of left lower leg, found to have leukocytosis.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  There are somewhat increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally, similar or slightly worse since the study
 of ___.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is evidence of prior rib
 fractures on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1.  Somewhat increased prominence of interstitial markings
 bilaterally since the prior study but not as prominent as the study of
 ___.  This is of unclear clinical significance, may in part relate to
 differences in technique with possible minimal underlying interstitial edema. 
 Atypical infection not entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 No focal consolidation.
