                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with amyloid and chest pain.  // Please
 evaluate for etiology of chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are again seen diffusely bilaterally suggest
 mild interstitial edema/ vascular congestion. A more focal opacity at the
 right mid to lower lung may relate to the underlying interstitial abnormality
 however, a superimposed pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Chronic lateral left lower rib deformity
 is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse increase in interstitial markings suggest mild interstitial edema
 superimposed on COPD. More focal opacity at the right mid to lower lung may
 relate to the above findings however, a superimposed pneumonia is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting. .
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ discussed the findings with Dr. ___ at ___ am
 on ___.
