 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:16 PM
  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and a diffuse interstitial prominence is
  consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Focal opacity involving the right middle
  lobe is minimally improved from the prior examination and could represent an
  area of atelectasis or infection as before. Small left effusion is unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiac amyloid presenting with hypoxia,
 dyspnea, and increase oxygen requirement  // ?Pneumonia vs pulmonary edema vs
 acute cardiopulmonary process?     ?Pneumonia vs pulmonary edema vs acute
 cardiopulmonary proce
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric interstitial pulmonary abnormality, still favoring the right lung,
 has improved since ___.  The absence on the prior study and this one of
 any the pulmonary vascular congestion or venous engorgement is atypical for
 cardiogenic edema, but the patient has had a similar transient episode in the
 past, ___.  Small left pleural effusion persists.  Even though
 pleural effusion due to heart failure is more often right dominant, the
 sequence of events is consistent with atypical pulmonary edema.  If the
 patient has had transfusion or introduction of new medication, these can
 produce noncardiogenic edema.
