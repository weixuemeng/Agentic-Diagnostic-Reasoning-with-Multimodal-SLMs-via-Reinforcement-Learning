                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiac amyloid and leukocytosis.  //
 Please evaluate for possible infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___ r
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation consistent with background COPD.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution. There is more focal
 hazy opacity in the right perihilar region, similar to the chest x-ray from ___ and similar or slightly more pronounced compared with ___. There is subsegmental atelectasis in the retrocardiac region, increased.
 There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the AP view and,
 on the lateral view, a small pleural effusion is present, new compared with a
 lateral film from ___. Again seen is slight pleural thickening at
 the left chest wall inferiorly which appears to relate to an old healed rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion, new compared with ___.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without other findings pathognomic for CHF.
 3. Hazy focal perihilar right perihilar opacity is probably similar to the
 prior films. As before, this could represent residual CHF, but superimposed
 infection is difficult to exclude. Moreover, given persistence over time, the
 possibility of a chronic infiltrate should also be consider. Followup imaging
 to confirm resolution is recommended. In the absence of resolution, further
 assessment with CT scan would be recommended.
