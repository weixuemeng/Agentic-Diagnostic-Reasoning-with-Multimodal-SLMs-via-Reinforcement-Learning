                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CNS lymphoma, HIV and
 cough, suspected pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant prior studies available for comparison.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Focal semicircular opacity projecting over the subpleural area of the mid left
 lung field is noted and might potentially reflect pleural lesion such as
 lipoma, although other pleural abnormalities cannot be excluded.  Given the
 patient history, reassessment with chest CT for precise characterization of
 this abnormality is recommended.
