  1.  Mild vascular congestion.
  2.  Vertical linear retrocardiac opacity most consistent atelectasis,
  superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
  3.  Moderate cardiomegaly, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and
  patient positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hpoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph ___ 20:45.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  A vertical linear
 retrocardiac opacity is noted.  Mild vascular congestion is present.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient
 positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion.
 2.  Vertical linear retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis,
 however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly, accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient
 positioning.
