                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 small right apical pneumothorax.  Post-surgical changes are again seen on the
 right consistent with middle lobectomy.  The left lung is now essentially
 clear with the costophrenic angles sharp.
