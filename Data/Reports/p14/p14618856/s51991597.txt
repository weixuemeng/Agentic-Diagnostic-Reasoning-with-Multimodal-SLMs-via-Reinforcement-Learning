                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia and syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  There is
 re- demonstration of superior mediastinal widening, due to a combination of a
 tortuous thoracic aorta and focal aneurysmal dilatation of the descending
 thoracic aortic, better assessed on the previous CT.  Hilar contours are
 unchanged, and pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Unchanged widening of the superior
 mediastinum, attributable to a tortuous thoracic aorta and known focal
 aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta.
