                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Unchanged widening of the superior
 mediastinal contour from ___.  While this could be due to the
 presence of mediastinal fat, underlying lymphadenopathy or mass is not
 completely excluded.  Consider further assessment with CT of the chest.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S): Consider further assessment of the superior mediastinal
 widening with CT of the chest.
