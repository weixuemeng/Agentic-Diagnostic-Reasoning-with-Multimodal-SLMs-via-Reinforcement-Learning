                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is
 within the stomach. Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob calcifications are
 demonstrated. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Fullness of both
 hila may suggest underlying pulmonary arterial enlargement. Lungs appear
 hyperinflated which could reflect underlying COPD. There appears to be mild
 cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Punctate radiopaque densities projecting over the right lung base
 may be due to prior aspiration of barium. The left costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis. No large pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Limited study. Standard positions of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Evidence of prior aspiration of barium in the right lung base.
 4. Bibasilar atelectasis.
