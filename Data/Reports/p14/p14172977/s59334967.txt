                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after NG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Limited view of the lower chest and upper abdomen demonstrate NG tube being
 most likely in the very proximal stomach, partially imaged and potentially
 obscured by the spinal hardware.  Repeated radiograph is recommended.  Dilated
 bowel loops are still noted.
