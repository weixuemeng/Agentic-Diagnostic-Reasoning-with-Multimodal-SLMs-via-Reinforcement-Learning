                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, lung ca  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, CT torso from ___
 and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased opacity at the right lung base progressed since previous
 exams. There is also progression of volume loss in the right hemi thorax with
 right lateral deviation of the trachea. Left lung remains grossly clear. Prior
 left lateral rib fractures there noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of right basilar opacity with associated volume loss. This is
 likely due to underlying known effusion and component of atelectasis
 especially in setting of volume loss. Superimposed infection would also be
 possible. No other change.
