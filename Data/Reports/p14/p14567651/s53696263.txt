                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT, lobar collapse  // ETT position, lobar
 consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is 2.2 cm above the carinal. There is substantial interval
 decrease in right pleural effusion. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is most
 likely secondary to the a right lower lung collapse. The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach. Left basal consolidations appear to be increased as compared to
 previous study.
