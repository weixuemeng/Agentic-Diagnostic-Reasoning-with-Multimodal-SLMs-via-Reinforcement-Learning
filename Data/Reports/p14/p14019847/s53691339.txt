                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new rising leukocytosis and febrile  //
 please eval for PNA, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are better inflated on today's study with a more optimal inspiratory
 effort.  The trachea is central.  The cardiomediastinal contour is notable for
 enlargement of the right hilum, this is likely vascular as there is evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion on the prior study however continued
 attention on followup is recommended.  No consolidation, pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion seen.  The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the right hilum is likely vascular given the appearance on the
 prior chest radiographs however continued attention on followup is
 recommended.
