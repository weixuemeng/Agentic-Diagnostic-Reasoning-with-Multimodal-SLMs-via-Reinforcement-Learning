                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from standing with seizure.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as CT C-spine performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette may reflect technique as configuration appears largely
 unchanged compared to prior studies.  Minimal linear bibasilar opacifications
 likely due to atelectasis or scarring.  Bronchovascular crowding noted in the
 lung bases.  No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No
 displaced rib fracture identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
