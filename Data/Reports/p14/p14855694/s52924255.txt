 ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A linear opacity in the right mid lung
 projecting over the heart on the lateral view likely represents an area of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 confluent consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no vascular
 congestion, edema or large pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis in the right mid lung, though no
 confluent consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
