 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCC with rigors. rule out pna  // ?pneumonia
 ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest radiograph available was performed ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are mildly diminished, probably due to a widespread but
 relatively mild interstitial infiltrative abnormality in the lower lungs. 
 Since there is no cardiomegaly, or pulmonary vascular or mediastinal venous
 engorgement, this abnormality though dependent and symmetric is probably not
 not volume related or cardiogenic edema and could instead be interstitial
 pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A right central venous infusion port catheter ends close to the
 superior cavoatrial junction. .
