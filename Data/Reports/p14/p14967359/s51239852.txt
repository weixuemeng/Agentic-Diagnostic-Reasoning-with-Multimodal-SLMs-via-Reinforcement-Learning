                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory fatigue, intubation.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to ___, the major change has been intubation of the
 patient.  The ET tube tip is high, at the level of the thoracic inlet and
 although it is only 7 cm from the carina, it should be advanced for at least 3
 cm.  Bibasilar opacities are consistent with low lung volumes.  Reassessment
 of the radiograph after adjustment of the chest tube is recommended.
