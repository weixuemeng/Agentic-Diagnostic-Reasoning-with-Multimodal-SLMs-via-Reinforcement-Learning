                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with liver transplant, on immunosuppression, midway
 through treatment for pneumonia, now with worsening dyspnea and rising white
 blood cell count.  Assess for progression of infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest x-ray from ___ at 2:51 a.m. and
 chest x-ray from ___ as well as chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 multifocal bilateral patchy opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, which
 are worse compared to the prior x-ray from 2 a.m., especially on the right
 side.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of multifocal patchy opacities involving all
 lobes of the lungs are highly worrisome for rapidly progressing multifocal
 pneumonia.
