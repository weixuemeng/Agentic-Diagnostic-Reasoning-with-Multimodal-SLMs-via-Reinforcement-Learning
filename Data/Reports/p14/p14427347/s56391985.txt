                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and bronchiectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with a chest CT,
 ___:
 
 Severe hyperinflation reflects marked emphysema.  Coarse reticulation in the
 lower lungs is probably severe bronchiectasis, particularly in the right
 middle lobe.  A ___ x 24 mm elliptical opacity projecting over the right fourth
 anterior rib is probably a mucoid impaction, but many smaller lung nodules, in
 the cm size range, such as projecting over the left fourth anterior rib and
 third anterior interspace, in the right third and fifth anterior interspaces,
 while attributable to bronchiectasis, could be genuine lung nodules, and the
 mild generalized interstitial abnormality could be due to edema, rather than
 inflammation from bronchiectasis.  Heart size is top normal (given severe
 hyperinflation).  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
