                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Aortic stenosis, presenting with weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Fluid is also
 seen tracking in the fissure.  There is mild vascular congestion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Left basilar opacity likely represents combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Vascular
 congestion.  Cardiomegaly.
