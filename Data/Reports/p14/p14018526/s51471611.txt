 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure   recent TAVR, admitted for SOB
 // pulm edema / effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed 9 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate to large bilateral
 effusions larger on the left are unchanged, allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient. Improving opacities in the left mid hemi thorax
 are due to markedly improved aeration / prior large atelectasis. There are
 still atelectasis in the left base. Atelectasis in the right base have
 minimally improved. Moderate pulmonary edema is grossly unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Aortic stent is
 in place.
