                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent DHT tube placement.  // Evaluate
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___. 16:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the most recent prior film, Dobbhoff tube placement has been
 attempted. Allowing for slightly rotated positioning, the radiopaque portion
 of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the thoracic inlet/superior mediastinum. Because
 it does not pass distal to the carina, the Dobbhoff tube position in relation
 to the trachea cannot be confidently ascertained.  Clinical correlation is
 therefore requested.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
