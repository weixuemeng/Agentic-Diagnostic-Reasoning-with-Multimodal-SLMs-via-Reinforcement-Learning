                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute on chronic CHF with V-tach.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 16:01 p.m., there is little interval change.   
 
 Right-sided PICC line tip overlies the proximal SVC.
 
 Again seen are moderately large right and moderate-sized left pleural
 effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, with upper zone
 re-distribution, bronchial wall thickening, and vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF and pulmonary edema.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, though partially obscured by parenchymal
 findings, again appears enlarged, but unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, CHF and pulmonary edema, with bilateral effusions
 and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, very similar to one day earlier.
 The right effusion may be slightly larger.
