                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic stenosis s/p TAVR with temporary
 pacer in place  // Temp pacer, pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in bilateral
 perihilar opacities and an increase in peribronchial cuffing, both changes
 reflecting an increase in severity of pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions might have newly occurred.  The external pacemaker is in
 unchanged position. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
