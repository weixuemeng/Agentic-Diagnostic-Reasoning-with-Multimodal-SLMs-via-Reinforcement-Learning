  Apparent increase in size of collection in the right hemithorax as well as the
  loculated collection of the apex could be related to positioning.  Interval
  removal of surgical drain. Otherwise stable appearance of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post right upper lobectomy and right middle lobectomy.  Increased
 oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are lower in comparison to the prior examination from ___ at 8:53.  Again seen is a large right middle and upper zone
 gas/fluid collection and a subpleural loculated collection or lesion along the
 right lateral superior hemithorax, minimally changed since the 8:53
 examination.  Mild superimposed pulmonary edema appears stable.  The hilar
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There has been interval removal of an
 epidural catheter.  The right IJ catheter again terminates at the mid to upper
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large gas/fluid collections within the right mid to upper zone appear
 stable since the ___ examinations.
 2.  Unchanged background mild pulmonary edema.
