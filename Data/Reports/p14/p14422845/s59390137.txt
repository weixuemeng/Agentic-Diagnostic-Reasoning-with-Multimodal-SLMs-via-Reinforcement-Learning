                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary mucormycosis, post right middle lobectomy and upper
 lobe wedge resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new air-fluid level within a moderate-sized anterior upper right hemithorax
 reflects upright positioning of this examination; this collection appears is a
 right perihilar opacity on recent radiographs, and is roughly similar in size.
 A persistent loculated fluid collection near the right apex is minimally
 changed since the most recent ___ radiograph.  The left lung
 remains clear.  The heart size is unchanged.  An intrathecal line and right IJ
 central venous catheter are unchanged in position. A subcutaneous surgical
 drain overlies the right hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate sized loculated collection of gas and fluid within the right anterior
 hemithorax is more easily demonstrated on this dedicated upright view, and is
 similar in size in comparison to recent radiographs. A second loculated right
 apical collection is stable.
