                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Frequent falls with right chest tenderness, evaluate for
 pneumonia or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Aside from minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis, the lungs are clear.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  Marked
 degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular joint are seen.  A
 cortical step-off in the anterolateral aspect of the right sixth rib is
 consistent with a minimally displaced fracture.  No definite additional rib
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Minimally displaced right sixth rib fracture.  No definite additional rib
 fractures are identified, although a dedicated rib series with appropriately
 placed skin markers could provide further evaluation if clinically indicated.
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
