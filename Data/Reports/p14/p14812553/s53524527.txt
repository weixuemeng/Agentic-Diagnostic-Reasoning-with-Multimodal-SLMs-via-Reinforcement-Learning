                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same date, ___, 19:03.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  External
 artifact partially obscures the view.  There has been interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube, low in position, terminating approximately 1.3 cm above the
 level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.  There are relatively
 low lung volumes.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  Nondisplaced left-sided
 rib fractures seen on subsequent CT, better appreciated on that study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube low in position, terminating approximately 1.3
 cm above the level of the carina and should be withdrawn approximately 2 cm. 
 This finding was discussed with the trauma team shortly after discovery at
 approximately 7:50 p.m.
