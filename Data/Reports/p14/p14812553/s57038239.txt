                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 1:06 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with central line placement, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 19:25.
 
 A portable supine chest film at ___ at 1:20 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  No central vascular catheters visualized.  No large
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.  Increasing perihilar fullness and indistinctness of
 the interstitium likely reflect mild interstitial and perihilar edema.  No
 focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  Left-sided
 nondisplaced rib fractures, better appreciated on recent CT study dated
 ___.
