                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter newly placed. 
 Evaluate for proper placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiograph at 8:44 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the upper right atrium/cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is slightly increased opacity at the right lung base, which could be due to
 atelectasis, but aspiration or infection not excluded. Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is again seen.  The heart is top normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.
