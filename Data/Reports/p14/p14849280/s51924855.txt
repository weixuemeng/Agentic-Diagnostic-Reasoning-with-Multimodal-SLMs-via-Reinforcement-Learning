                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Per the
 technologist, the patient was unable to remain still or straight or follow
 directions.  The study is limited by patient rotation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is rotated to the right.  Given these limitations, the
 lungs are hyperinflated compatible with COPD.  There are patchy opacities at
 the lung bases.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax detected. No pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Study limited by patient rotation.  Slightly low lung volumes,
 with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, although infection is
 difficult to exclude.
