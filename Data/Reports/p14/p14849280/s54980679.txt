                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 140  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post fall with crackles at the right
 base, question infection or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 1:40 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  Lungs
 remain hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 The pulmonary arteries are somewhat prominent but unchanged but raise the
 possibility of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may reflect a tiny effusion or pleural thickening. Unfolded
 tortuous aorta unchanged.
