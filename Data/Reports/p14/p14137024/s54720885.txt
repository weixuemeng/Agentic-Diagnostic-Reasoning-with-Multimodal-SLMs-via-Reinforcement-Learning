                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diarrhea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference was made to prior chest CT from ___.
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Calcified hilar nodes are better assessed on CT.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP
 diameter, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Slight
 increase in interstitial opacities diffusely bilaterally may relate to chronic
 lung disease.  Atypical infection is less likely.  There may also be a
 component of minimal interstitial edema.  There is no focal consolidation.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although very trace pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.  There is minimal biapical pleural thickening.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  Hyperinflated lungs with mild diffuse
 increase in interstitial markings may relate to chronic lung disease. 
 However, atypical infection is less likely.
