 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:30 PM
  Compared to prior radiograph from ___, lung volumes are lower, with
  persistent bilateral parenchymal lower lobe predominant opacities, likely
  representing edema, although a superimposed infection is possible. No
  significant change in cardiomegaly, given differences in technique. No
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
   Arison chest radiographs ___.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent asp PNA, COPD, CHF on ESRD, newly
 hypoxic  // ? new infiltrate / edema?      ? new infiltrate / edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accounting in part but probably not entirely for
 interval increase in moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Mediastinal veins are distended, but mild to moderate pulmonary edema has
 improved, in the upper lungs.  The lower lungs are more opacified today,
 probably a combination of atelectasis and edema.
 
 The previous examination, on ___, suggested above presence of lung
 nodules up to a cm in size.  These are no longer seen.  If there is concern
 about disseminated infection, and the patient's clinical status justifies it,
 CT scanning would be helpful in assessment.
 
 Incidental note is made of heavy carotid artery calcification.
