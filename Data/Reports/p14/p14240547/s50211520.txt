                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rigors and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again low lung volumes are associated with prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Continued mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with atelectatic
 changes in the retrocardiac region.  If there are appropriate clinical
 findings, the possibility of supervening pneumonia in the retrocardiac region
 must be considered.
