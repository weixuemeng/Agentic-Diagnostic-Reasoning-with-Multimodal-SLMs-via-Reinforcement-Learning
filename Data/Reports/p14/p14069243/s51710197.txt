                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube tip courses
 below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders
 of the film.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart
 size is normal.  The aorta markedly tortuous.  Ill-defined alveolar opacities
 are noted in the the left lung base, right upper lobe, and right lung base,
 findings which may reflect multifocal pneumonia and/or asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Hilar contours are prominent which could suggest underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 High-density material seen within the collecting systems bilaterally likely
 reflective of contrast from previous CT exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Ill-defined alveolar opacities within the left lung base and right lung
 which may reflect multifocal pneumonia and/or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
