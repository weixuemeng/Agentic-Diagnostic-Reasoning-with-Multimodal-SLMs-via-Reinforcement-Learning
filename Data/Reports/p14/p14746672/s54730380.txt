                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left sided chest wall pain  // R/O pleural
 changes      R/O pleural changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural abnormality.  Normal mediastinal
 and hilar contours.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
