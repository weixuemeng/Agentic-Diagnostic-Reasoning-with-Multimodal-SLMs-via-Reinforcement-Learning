 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast ___
 Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval increase in mild pulmonary edema with cephalization of pulmonary
 vessels. Right apical scarring is stable.  There is a retrocardiac opacity. 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Prominence of the pulmonary arteries are
 again noted, unchanged since prior examination.  Heart size and mediastinal
 contour are otherwise unremarkable.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm is unchanged
 in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Progression of mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable prominence of pulmonary arteries.
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation recommended for superimposed infection.
