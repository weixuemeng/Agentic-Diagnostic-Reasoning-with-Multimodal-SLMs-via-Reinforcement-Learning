                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Postoperative day 1, status post hysterectomy, low-grade fevers,
 evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  Minimal increase in density at the
 inferior aspect of the right hilus.  The morphology of the opacity is more
 likely to reflect local atelectasis than pneumonia.  However, an upright chest
 radiographs for comparison should be obtained as soon as possible.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or masses.  No hilar or mediastinal
 abnormalities.
