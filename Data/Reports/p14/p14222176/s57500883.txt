                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There is
 no pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is obscured.  No pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to retrocardiac opacities,
 which may reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection may be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
