                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post Pleurx catheter placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Right-sided chest tube is in situ as well as a smaller right basal Pleurx
 catheter.  There appears to be a small persistent apical pneumothorax with a
 maximum gap of about 1.5 cm.  The heart size is normal.  The lungs are
 otherwise grossly clear.
 
 No significant interval change from prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Small residual pneumothorax in right apex.  The catheter is in good position. 
 A residual volume is probably small.
