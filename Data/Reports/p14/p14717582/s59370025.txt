                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, history of peritoneal cancer
 with a right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis at outside hospital. 
 Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.  Comparison is made to selected
 images from the abdominal and pelvic CT scan dated ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is
 patchy airspace opacity at the right base which likley represents an area of
 residual atelectasis, although an acute infectious process should also be
 considered.  The other possibility would be a re-expansion pulmonary edema in
 the right lower lobe given the clinical history of recent thoracentesis for a
 large right effusion at an outside facility.  There is likely a small layering
 right effusion, especially when correlated with the abdominal CT of ___.
 No large left effusion is seen.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.
