                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in parenchymal opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the prior
 studies.  Unchanged right subclavian Port-A-Cath ends in the lower portion of
 the superior vena cava.  Unchanged ___ drain enters via a right anterior
 abdominal approach and courses superiorly along the right mediastinum, loops
 posterior and courses inferomedially to end in the left lower lung.  Bilateral
 lower lung linear opacities are most likely atelectasis.  Expected
 post-esophagectomy changes including an air-fluid level in the mediastinum. 
 No vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There has been
 interval improvement of bilateral parenchymal opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of parenchymal opacities.
