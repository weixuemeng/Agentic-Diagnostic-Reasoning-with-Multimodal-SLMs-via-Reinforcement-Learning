                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after neoadjuvant
 chemoradiation for T3N1 esophageal cancer, assessment for interval change.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  The
 neoesophagus with air-fluid level is projecting to the right of the
 mediastinum on the PA view and posteriorly on the lateral view, unchanged as
 compared to the prior study, currently with substantial amount of fluid
 content, more than on the previously imaged radiograph.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There are no new consolidations or masses
 demonstrated.
