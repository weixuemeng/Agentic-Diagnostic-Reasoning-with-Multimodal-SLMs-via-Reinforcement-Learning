                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in this patient who has undergone a previous esophagectomy.  Monitoring
 and support devices remain in place.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again
 seen with mild blunting of the costophrenic angles.  Large air-fluid level is
 seen within the pull-through.
