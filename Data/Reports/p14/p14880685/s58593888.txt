                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change, status post chest tube removal in
 a patient status post esophagectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 8 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior study, the right-sided chest tube has been removed.  Expected
 esophagectomy changes including air-fluid level in the right hemithorax are
 unchanged.  The left subclavian Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  The
 lungs are clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No interval change except removal of right chest tube. No
 pneumothorax.
