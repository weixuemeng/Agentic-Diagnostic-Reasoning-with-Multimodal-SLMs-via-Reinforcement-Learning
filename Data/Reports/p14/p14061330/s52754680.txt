                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacities are concerning for an
 infectious process.  A ___-mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid
 lung on the frontal radiograph is new compared to the prior study from
 ___, possibly also infectious in nature, although a pulmonary
 nodule is not excluded.  There is minimal left lower lung atelectasis.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a small
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  A right mid lung nodular opacity could also
 be infectious in nature, although a followup radiograph after antibiotic
 therapy is recommended to exclude an underlying pulmonary nodule.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Possible small right pleural effusion. 
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:46 a.m.
 via telephone on ___.
