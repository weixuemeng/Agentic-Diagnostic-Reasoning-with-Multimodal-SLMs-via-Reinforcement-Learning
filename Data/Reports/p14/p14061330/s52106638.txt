                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A opacity in the right lower lobe appears
 similar and suggests pneumonia.  A nodular opacity projecting over the right
 lung can be persistently visualized, although somewhat less conspicuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right basilar opacity suggesting pneumonia. 
 Cardiomegaly.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show complete
 resolution of abnormalities within eight weeks given concern for the
 possibility of underlying lung nodule in the right lung.
