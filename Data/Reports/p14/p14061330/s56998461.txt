                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD and CHF  // Assess for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is marked cardiomegaly, overall similar to the
 prior film.  There is vascular plethora, with interstitial and alveolar edema.
 The appearance is also similar to the prior film, though the degree of
 confluence of the opacities in the right lung appears greater on today's exam.
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is compatible with small
 effusions, possibly slightly smaller than on the earlier study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly and interstitial and alveolar opacities, with small
 effusions.  The appearance is compatible with CHF/pulmonary edema,
 particularly in light of the degree of cardiomegaly and a history of ESRD.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, other etiologies could give rise to a
 similar appearance.
