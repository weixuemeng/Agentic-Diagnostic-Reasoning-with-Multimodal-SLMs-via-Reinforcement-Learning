                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Vague
 opacity is noted in the left lower lobe, concerning for an early pneumonia. 
 There is also subtle opacity in the right middle lobe.  Overall, findings
 suggest multifocal pneumonia.  Trace fluid tracks along the fissural planes. 
 The upper lobes appear well aerated.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  A mid thoracic compression deformity is unchanged.  No new
 compression fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacities in the lower lungs compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia.
