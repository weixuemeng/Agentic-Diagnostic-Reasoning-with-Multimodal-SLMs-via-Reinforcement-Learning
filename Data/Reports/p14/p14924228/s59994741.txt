                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increased weakness, status post fall, assess for
 intrathoracic abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is known
 to have bilateral breast implants with peripheral calcification which is
 unchanged from prior exams.  The heart is moderately enlarged which appears
 increased from prior exams.  The lower lungs appear increased in density on
 the frontal projection which is likely due to the overlying dense breast
 implants.  On the lateral view there is no correlate abnormality to suggest
 the presence of pneumonia or contusion.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  While there are no definite signs of CHF, study is somewhat limited due
 to the dense breast implants overlying the chest.  Mediastinal contour is
 notable for atherosclerotic calcifications.  No definite bony abnormalities
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, new from priors.  Dense breast implants overlying
 the lower lungs likely accounting for vague lower lung opacity.
