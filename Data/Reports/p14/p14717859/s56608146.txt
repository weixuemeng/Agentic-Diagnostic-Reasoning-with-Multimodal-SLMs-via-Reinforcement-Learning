                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of weakness and fatigue.
 
 STUDY: PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON: none.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There
 is nodular prominence of the right hilus which may represent engorgement of
 central pulmonary vessels.  The lungs demonstrate diffuse edema with nodular
 opacities representing over the upper thoracic spine on lateral view as well
 as in the mid-to-lower right lateral lung.  There is a trace right and small
 left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions; prominent right
 hilus may represent engorged vasculature, but nodular opacities within the
 lung warrant chest CT after diuresis to assess the nodular opacities and right
 hilus.
