 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:44 PM
  A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC and is stable in position.
  There has been interval placement of a right-sided pleural, pigtail catheter
  and decrease in size of a right-sided pneumothorax. A trace apical right
  pneumothorax may be present. A right pleural effusion is not significantly
  changed from the prior study. Bilateral opacities are persistent and likely
  represent multifocal pneumonia, minimally increased in extent from the prior
  exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with c. diff ileitis, RLL PNA, and new PTX, s/p
 chest tube placement ___min ago.  // please eval s/p chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ___ radiograph shows interval placement of a right apical
 pigtail catheter with re-expansion of the right lung. Only a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax remains. The right PICC line is unchanged in position, ending in
 the low SVC. There is no appreciable interval change in widespread
 interstitial and airspace opacities. Small to moderate right pleural effusion
 is unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the
 projection.
 
 The followup radiograph from ___ shows interval decrease in the
 tiny right apical pneumothorax. The right apical pigtail catheter and right
 PICC line are unchanged in position. Diffuse airspace opacities have worsened,
 particularly in the right upper lung, which may be due to worsening infection
 or re-expansion pulmonary edema. Otherwise, there is no additional interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post placement of a right apical pigtail catheter with marked decrease
 in trace right apical pneumothorax.
 
 Interval worsening of widespread airspace opacities, particularly in the right
 upper lung, which may be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Stable small to moderate layering right pleural effusion.
