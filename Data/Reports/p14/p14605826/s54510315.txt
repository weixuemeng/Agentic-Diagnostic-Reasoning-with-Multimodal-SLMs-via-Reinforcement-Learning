                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R cavitary lesion and PTX, on vent,
 increasing O2 requirements  // Evolution of PTX/cavitary lesion, pulmonary
 edema, new process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier the same date, is right
 apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with small residual pneumothorax
 remaining and pigtail pleural catheter in place. An additional basilar
 component of the pneumothorax is suspected. Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 rapid improvement in diffuse combined alveolar and interstitial opacities,
 likely due to pulmonary edema although coexisting infection is possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
