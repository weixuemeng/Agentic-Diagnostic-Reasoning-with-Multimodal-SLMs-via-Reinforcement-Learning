                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // ? PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Status post right upper lobe mass removed via lobectomy. Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is likely secondary to volume loss and is stable over
 multiple prior studies.  Opacity at the right hilum is likely due to
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal opacities, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 The air in the soft tissues overlying the right chest is likely related to a
 prior chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Right hilar opacity is most consistent with atelectasis.
