                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved
 lung volumes.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen with
 atelectatic changes at the base.  No definite vascular congestion at this
 time.  The tip of the PICC line is difficult to see, though it appears to
 extend to the cavoatrial junction or slightly below it.
