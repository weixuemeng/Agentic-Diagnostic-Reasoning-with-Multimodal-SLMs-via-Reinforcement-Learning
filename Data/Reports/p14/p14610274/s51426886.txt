  low lung volumes w/ bibasilar atelectasis and worsening pulmonary edema;
  chronic L hemidiaphragmatic elevation limits assessment for subtle pleural
  effusion; blunting of R costophrenic angle reflects small pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AVR, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  A minimal left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded, there is increasing blunting of the right costophrenic sinus,
 suggesting a mild-to-moderate pleural effusion on the right.  The vascular
 diameters have minimally increased, suggesting mild fluid overload.  Unchanged
 sternotomy wires and ECG cables.
