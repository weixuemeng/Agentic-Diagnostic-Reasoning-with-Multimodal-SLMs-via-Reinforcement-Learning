                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ ___ with PND and orthopnea 2 months post partum // please
 evaluate for evidence of cardiomyopathy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is indistinctness of the aortic knob, and elevated right pulmonary
 artery, and an enlarged left pulmonary artery suggestive of a developmental
 mediastinal anomaly or, alternatively, lymphadenopathy.  Heart size is normal.
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear without focal consolidations or suspicious
 pulmonary nodules.  No pleural abnormalities.  Incidental note is made of a
 gastric band in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mediastinal abnormalities described above may reflect a developmental
 mediastinal anomaly or, alternatively, lymphadenopathy.  Correlation with
 prior chest imaging may be helpful, if available.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend correlation with prior chest imaging if
 available.
