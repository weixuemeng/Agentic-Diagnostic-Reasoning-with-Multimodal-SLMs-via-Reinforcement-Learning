                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New-onset respiratory distress, question aspiration.
 
 Status post left hemicolectomy with transverse colostomy for adeno CA at
 splenic flexure.
 
 An NG tube is present.  The tip overlies the gastric fundus.  Additional wires
 overlie the chest, which require clinical correlation for full assessment.  
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is prominent, but unchanged compared with ___ at 22:23 p.m.  There is a
 small-to-moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to the prior film.  There is new opacity in the right
 mid zone extending into the minor fissure.  There is left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and patchy opacity at the left base, which is also
 similar to prior, allowing for technique.  Possible mild upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  Small vertical linear density adjacent to
 the left chest wall is unchanged -- ? calcified pleural plaque.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small-to-moderate right effusion, with underlying collapse or
 consolidation at the right base, similar to prior.
 2.  New patchy opacity, right mid zone, possibly in the lower portion of the
 right upper lobe -- ? aspiration pneumonitis or focal pneumonia.
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and atelectasis at the left
 base, similar to prior.
