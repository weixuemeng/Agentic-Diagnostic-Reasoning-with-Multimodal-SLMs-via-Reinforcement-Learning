                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___/M s/p right THA with rising WBC, +smoker  // ? pneumonia vs
 atelectasis      ? pneumonia vs atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are very low, and although there is enough opacification in the
 lung bases on the frontal view to raise concern for pneumonia, there is no
 corresponding abnormality on the lateral, and therefore I favor atelectasis. 
 Heart is normal size and there is no pleural effusion.
