                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history ___ ___'s disease with recent
 altered mental status of unknown etiology.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with spot fluoroscopic images from
 tunneled dialysis catheter placement from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm which may be due to left lower lobe atelectasis and volume
 loss or could also represent a retrocardiac consolidation.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  The previously seen dialysis catheter is unchanged in
 position, terminating in the right atrium.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may represent left lower
 lobe atelectasis with volume loss or a retrocardiac consolidation.  Lateral
 views would be helpful in resolving this finding.
