                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line that has been pulled back.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiac size is minimally enlarged.  Right
 large central catheter is in standard position.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Increasing opacities in the left lung are consistent with increasing mild
 effusion and basal atelectasis.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased.
