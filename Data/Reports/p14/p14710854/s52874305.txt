  1. Left PICC terminates within the deep right heart, possibly within the right
  ventricle, and should be withdrawn by approximately 9 cm.
  
  2. Retrocardiac opacification may reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be
  excluded.
  
  3. Interval decrease in size of previously noted bilateral pleural effusions,
  with likely a trace amount of left-sided pleural effusion remaining.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pneumonia with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left PICC tip terminates deep within the right heart, likely within the
 right ventricle, and should be withdrawn approximately 9 cm.  Right-sided dual
 lumen central venous catheter tip terminates within the proximal right atrium.
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.  Previously noted bilateral pleural effusions
 appear to have nearly resolved, with likely a small residual left-sided
 pleural effusion present.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left PICC terminates within the deep right heart, possibly within the right
 ventricle, and should be withdrawn by approximately 9 cm.
 
 2. Retrocardiac opacification may reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be
 excluded.
 
 3. Interval decrease in size of previously noted bilateral pleural effusions,
 with likely a trace amount of left-sided pleural effusion remaining.
