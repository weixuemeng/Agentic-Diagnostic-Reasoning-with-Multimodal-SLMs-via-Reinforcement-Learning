                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status now status post NG tube placement for feeding
 /meds.  Please evaluate for NG tube placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 A right dual-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right
 atrium.  The left PICC line terminates in the right atrium, possibly within
 the right ventricle as was noted yesterday.  A new nasogastric tube has its
 tip projecting over the stomach.  The tip turns and head cephalad but appears
 to be within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low, resulting in mild vascular
 crowding not significantly changed.  The heart is top normal.  The
 retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may represent atelectasis or small
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left PICC line is unchaned in position terminating in the right heart and
 should be withdrawn 8 cm to place the tip in the low SVC. 
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube projects over the expected location of the stomach.  
  
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may represent atelectasis or small
 pleural effusion, infection cannot be excluded.
