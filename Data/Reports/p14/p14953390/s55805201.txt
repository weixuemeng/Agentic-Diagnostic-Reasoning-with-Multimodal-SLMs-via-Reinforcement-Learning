                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG/TVR.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided subclavian dialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Transvenous dual lead pacer device terminates in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Enteric tube extends beyond the diaphragm with tip out
 of view.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 The heart is severely enlarged, unchanged compared to most recent chest
 radiograph however increase compared to multiple priors.  Mediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged from prior study from ___.  New opacity in
 the right upper lung is concerning for pneumonia, although asymmetric
 pulmonary edema can also have this appearance.  Bilateral hilar fullness is
 consistent with continued pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity at the right
 lung base likely represents basilar atelectasis, given mild elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  There is improved aeration of the left lung.  There is
 no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable right upper lobe pneumonia.
 2. Persistent minimal pulmonary edema.
 3. Increased right basilar atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, P.A. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:04 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
