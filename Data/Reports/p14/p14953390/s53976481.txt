 chest cardiac device with lead tips projecting over the right atrium and right
 ventricle are similar to prior.  Lung volumes are even lower than prior,
 causing bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiac silhouette. 
 There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema.  There is
