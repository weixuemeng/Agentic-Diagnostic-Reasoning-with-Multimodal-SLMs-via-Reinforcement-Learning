                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG TVr  // eval for line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 13:45, chest fluoro images ___ at 14:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube courses below
 the diaphragm and out of view; the side port and tip are not seen.  The right
 PA catheter tip appears to be in the left main pulmonary artery, similar to
 the recent final chest fluoro image.  Right jugular venous line tip appears to
 be near the SVC/RA junction, although somewhat difficult to determine due to
 the PA catheter running through it.
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the
 cardiac silhouette, similar to prior. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion
 and mild edema are similar to prior.  Moderate left and trace right pleural
 effusions are similar to prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of an NG tube and exchange of a right jugular line with a
 PA catheter placed through it, as seen on recent chest fluoro.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___ by ___
 via telephone at 8:29 AM on ___.
