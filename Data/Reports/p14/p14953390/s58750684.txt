                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post CABG/TVR.  Rule out infection or
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  Left
 pectoral transvenous pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Enteric tube extends beyond the diaphragm with tip out of view. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 The heart is severely enlarged, unchanged since ___.  Increased
 indistinct opacities bilaterally in combination with increased fullness of
 bilateral hila are compatible with increased mild pulmonary edema.  The focal
 opacity in the right upper lung seen on prior chest radiograph appears less
 confluent on the current study.  Increased opacity in the left lung base
 likely secondary to increased pleural effusion.  Atelectasis at the right lung
 base has decreased.  Small right pleural effusion persists.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Previously seen right upper lobe opacity appears less confluent compared to
 prior study.
 2. Increased mild pulmonary edema with increased left pleural effusion
 3. Improved right basilar atelectasis and persistent small right pleural
 effusion.
