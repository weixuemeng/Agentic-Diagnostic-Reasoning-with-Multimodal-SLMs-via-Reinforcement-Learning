                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post recent chest tube removal.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a right subclavian line
 terminating at the level of the mid to lower SVC in constant position. 
 Previously identified small right apical pneumothorax persist but is decreased
 in size.  The lungs are grossly clear with no new focal consolidation.  There
 is persistent unchanged large left pleural effusion with associated basilar
 atelectasis.  There is additional right opacification unchanged from prior
 examination 1 day ago, likely atelectasis although differential includes
 aspiration pneumonia.  Incidental note is made of IVC filter and contrast
 material within loops of bowel.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent but decreased small right apical pneumothorax. 
 
 Unchanged bibasilar opacifications likely atelectasis but cannot exclude
 pneumonia.
