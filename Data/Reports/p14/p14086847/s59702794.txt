                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post esophagectomy now status post chest
 tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 right-sided chest tube with resultant small apical pneumothorax.  There is no
 evidence of tension.  There is a persistent large left pleural effusion with
 bibasilar opacities which appears improved on the left and slightly worse on
 the right.  This opacification is most likely atelectasis although the
 differential diagnosis includes aspiration and pneumonia.  A right subclavian
 line terminates at the level of the mid to low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of right-sided chest tube with new small apical pneumothorax.
 
 
 Bibasilar opacities (left greater than right), likely due to atelectasis,
 although the differential includes aspiration and pneumonia.
