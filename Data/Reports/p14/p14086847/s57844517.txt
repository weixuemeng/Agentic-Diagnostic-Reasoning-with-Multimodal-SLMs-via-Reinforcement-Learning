                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post laparoscopic esophagectomy.  New
 right chest tube.  Evaluate for position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a new right chest tube seen
 projecting over the apex of the right lung with its terminal end along the
 midline at the level of the right main bronchus.  No pneumothorax.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen with its tip projecting over the right main bronchi
 in the anticipated course of neo esophagus.  Persistent bilateral basilar
 atelectasis with likely small left pleural effusion.  Increased density within
 the left lower lobe.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 No pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumothorax.  
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with increased density within the left lower lobe. 
 Recommend close follow up to exclude developing pneumonia and confirm probable
 atelectasis instead.
