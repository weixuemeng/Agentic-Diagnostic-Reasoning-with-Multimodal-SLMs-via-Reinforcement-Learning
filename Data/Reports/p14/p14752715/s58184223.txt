  An endotracheal tube ends the mid thoracic trachea.  Lung volumes are low.  A
  right central venous line ends in the low SVC.  An enteric tube appears to
  course below the level of the diaphragm.  Prominence of the left hilum was
  likely due to rotation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with scrotal infection  // Please eval for ETT
 position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Right internal jugular vascular
 catheter terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes
 and patient rotation accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours, limiting
 assessment.  Lungs are grossly clear except for a nonspecific left lower lobe
 opacity with adjacent small left pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat, nonrotated radiograph is suggested to allow more
 accurate assessment of cardiomediastinal contours.
