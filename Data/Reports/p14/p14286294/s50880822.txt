                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution.  Patchy
 opacities are noted in the bases, which may reflect areas of atelectasis
 though contusion or infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with patchy bibasilar opacities,
 potentially atelectasis though infection or contusion cannot be excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.
