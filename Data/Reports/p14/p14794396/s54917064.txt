                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, to rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and a CT torso with contrast
 ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  In comparison to the prior study, a nodular opacity in the right
 upper lobe measuring approximately 13 mm, is new.  The left lung appears
 relatively clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
 is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Surgical clips are seen
 in the left paraspinal region in the abdomen, consistent with prior
 nephrectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New nodular opacity in the right upper lobe, concerning for
 metastatic disease, less likely infection in this patient with known history
 of RCC.  A chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
