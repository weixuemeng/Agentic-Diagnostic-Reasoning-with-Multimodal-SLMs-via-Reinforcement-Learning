 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cancer, baseline chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nodular opacity at the
 bases of the right upper lobe, that was clearly present at the last
 examination, has completely cleared.  There currently is no evidence of lung
 nodules or lung masses suggestive of metastatic lung disease.  The pleural
 surfaces are even.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions.  No evidence of
 rib abnormalities.  Clips are seen projecting over the medial aspect of the
 left lung apex, cranially to the aortic knob.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
 Clips projecting over the left upper quadrant.
