                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest wall tenderness  // Eval for
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ and chest
 CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, the previously described right upper lobe nodularity
 has improved, with residual left upper lobe opacities, possibly repesenting
 postinflammatory scarring. There is no large pleural effusion, focal
 pneumonia, or pneumothorax. Left apical clips are unchanged in position. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Postsurgical changes in the upper
 abdomen are related to prior left nephrectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Improved biapical opacities as compared to prior radiograph in early ___. Small pulmonary nodules are better assessed on prior chest CT from ___.
