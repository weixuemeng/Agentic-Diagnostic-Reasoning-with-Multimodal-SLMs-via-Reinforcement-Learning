                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, cough. History of metastatic renal disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present which accentuate the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Ill-defined somewhat nodular opacities are noted within the
 upper lobes bilaterally, more pronounced on the left, similar to that seen on
 the prior CT. Known smaller nodules within the lower lobes bilaterally are
 better assessed on prior CT. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left lung
 base.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
 Multiple clips are noted within the left upper abdomen compatible with prior
 nephrectomy.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined nodular opacities within the upper lobes, more pronounced on the
 left, are similar compared to the prior CT, and again may reflect a drug
 related pneumonitis. No focal consolidation identified. Minimal atelectasis in
 the left lung base.
