                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute onset hypoxmia  // eval for
 collapsed lung/mucous plugging
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to recent radiograph of earlier the same date, the left lung is
 now nearly completely collapsed, likely on the basis of mucous plugging.  This
 subsequently improves on a separately dictated chest radiograph performed
 later the same date.  Within the right lung, there is worsening atelectasis in
 the right middle and right lower lobes.  Airspace disease in the right upper
 lobe is minimally improved, and bilateral pleural effusions are not
 substantially changed.
