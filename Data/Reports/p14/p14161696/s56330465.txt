                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously identified well-circumscribed opacity at the right lung base
 medially is partially obscured by the heart but still visualized.  Lower lung
 volumes are identified on the current exam.  Increased opacity projects over
 the left hemi thorax potentially due to parenchymal opacities, potentially in
 part atelectasis given lower lung volumes.  Right upper lung opacity is also
 new since prior.  There are old healed right lateral rib fractures.  Increased
 opacity projecting along the right lateral chest and right lung base could due
 to pleural thickening and/or effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 assess.  And accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Parenchymal opacities throughout the left lung and right upper lung which
 could be infection in the proper clinical setting.
 Increased pleural based opacity on the right, potentially pleural-based
 thickening and/or possible effusion.
 Consider PA and lateral to further assess these findings.  Followup will
 certainly be necessary.
