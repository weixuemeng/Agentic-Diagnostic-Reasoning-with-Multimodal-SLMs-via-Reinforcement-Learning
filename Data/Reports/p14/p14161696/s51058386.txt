                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, s/p
 bronch today with thick secretions now with acute hypoxia.  // Eval for acute
 change (whiteout, pulm edema, infiltrate, etc).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the previous study of earlier the same date, previously
 present complete right lung collapse has partially improved, with better
 aeration of the right upper lobe and part of the right middle lobe, with
 substantial atelectasis remaining in the right lower and middle lobes. 
 Although the right upper lobe is mostly re-expanded, note is made of airspace
 consolidation at the apex.  Additionally, a new confluent opacity  has
 developed in the left mid and lower lung, which is probably a combination of
 atelectasis/consolidation and pleural effusion.
