                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p LVAD.  Eval lines and ? infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. 
 Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is unchanged in position.  Left IJ central
 line tip is unchanged, extending to the junction of the brachiocephalic vein
 and superior vena cava.  Pacer lead tip projects in the region of the right
 ventricle.  Positioning of the LVAD is unchanged.
 
 The prior left chest tube is unchanged in position, with interval decrease in
 the amount of pleural fluid.  Increased aeration of the bilateral lower lungs.
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.  Moderate severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged positioning of multiple lines and tubes and the LVAD.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates 5.1 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Previous bilateral pulmonary opacifications are persisting, but have
 cleared, predominantly in the lower lobes.  Therefore, superimposed pneumonia
 in the upper lobes is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
