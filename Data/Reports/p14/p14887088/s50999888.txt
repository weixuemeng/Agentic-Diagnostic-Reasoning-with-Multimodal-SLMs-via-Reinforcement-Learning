  Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  Right-sided
  central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Enteric
  catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view.  Compared to
  prior x-ray there is interval increase in bilateral likely moderate to large
  pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  No definite focal opacification
  identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 6 cm above the
 carina.  There is suggestion of increasing haziness involving both lower lung
 zones, most likely reflecting layering pleural effusions.  Otherwise, little
 overall change.
