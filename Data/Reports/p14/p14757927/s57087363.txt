                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for resolution of a possible pneumonia seen on prior chest
 radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT cervical spine, both from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate resolution of the previously
 seen right upper lobe opacity.  There is minimal left lower lobe linear
 atelectasis. The heart is normal in size, with likely a prominent cardiac fat
 pad.    Rightward deviation of the upper trachea is consistent with a known
 multinodular goiter.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Resolution of the previously seen right upper lobe opacity.
