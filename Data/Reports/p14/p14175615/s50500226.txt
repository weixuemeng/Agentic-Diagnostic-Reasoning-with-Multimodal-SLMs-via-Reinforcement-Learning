                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pigtail catheter placement for right pneumothorax. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, a new pigtail catheter has been placed.  It
 overlies the right upper lung zone.  The right pneumothorax has decreased in
 size and is now small, measuring approximately 8 mm in width.  There is no
 evidence of tension physiology.  There is no left pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right pigtail catheter, which overlies
 the right upper lung zone.  A small right apical pneumothorax persists, though
 is smaller is size since the prior exam.
