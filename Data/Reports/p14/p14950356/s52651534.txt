                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to multiple prior
 plain films dating back to ___ with most recent from ___ in addition to chest CT from ___.
 
 When compared to most recent exam from ___, there has been interval
 progression of the airspace disease identified at the left lung base.  In
 addition, there is a new air-fluid level identified in the retrocardiac
 region.  This could potentially represent cavitary pneumonia; however, may
 also represent fluid within severely dilated bronchi, noting that this degree
 of bronvchiectasis was not tin the loated on remote CT scan.  COnsolidation
 with multiple air-fluid levels are identified within the right lung base as
 well, likely fluid within dilated bronchi as well.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of airspace disease, particularly at the
 left lung base concerning for pneumonia.  Superimposed air-fluid level in the
 left lung base medially, potentially air within enlarged bronchus versus
 cavitary pneumonia.  Multiple air-fluid levels at the right lung base
 suggestive of fluid within dilated bronchi as demonstrated on previous exam. 
 CT scan would offer additional detail.
