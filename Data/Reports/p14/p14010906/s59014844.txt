 INDICATION:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is interstitial prominence which may represent
 vascular crowding but a compenent of volume overload in the setting acute
 kidney injury cannot be excluded. The pleural and pulmonary structures are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No consolidation
 is seen.  The cardiac size is enlarged and sternotomy wires are noted.  There
 are no suspicious osseous lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial prominence may represent vascular crowding but mild
 volume overload is not excluded.
