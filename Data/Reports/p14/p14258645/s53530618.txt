                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:40 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Basal pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to three radiographs on ___:
 
 If there is left pneumothorax, it is quite small.  I do not see enough of
 change in the relationship of extensive left pleural calcifications with left
 chest wall to diagnose pneumothorax.  Lungs are obscured by pleural
 calcification.  Cardiomegaly is mild.
 
 If there is need to exclude pneumothorax with greater certainty, I would
 suggest either a right decubitus chest radiograph including the left chest
 wall, or CT scanning.
