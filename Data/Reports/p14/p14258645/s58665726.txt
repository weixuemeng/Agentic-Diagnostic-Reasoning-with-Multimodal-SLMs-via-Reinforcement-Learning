                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of effusion with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are densely calcified bilateral
 pleural plaques.  This limits detailed evaluation of the underlying lung
 parenchyma.  Increased opacity at the left lung base is compatible with
 pleural effusion, not definitely changed since the recent CT scan given
 differences in technique.  Increased opacity projecting over the right lung
 base is likely due to superimposed calcified plaque noting the underlying
 parenchymal opacity would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Densely calcified bilateral pleural plaques which obscure detailed evaluation
 of the underlying lung parenchyma.  Persistent left-sided pleural effusion,
 not definitely changed in size compared to the recent CT scan.  Please note
 that underlying parenchymal opacity would be difficult to exclude given
 extensive pleural plaque.
