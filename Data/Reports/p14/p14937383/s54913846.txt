 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with inability to walk for past week.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, likely
 accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Minimal patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are detected in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
