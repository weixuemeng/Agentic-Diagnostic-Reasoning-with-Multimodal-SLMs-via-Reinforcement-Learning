                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left hip fracture, pre-op planning.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 prominence of the interstitial markings is grossly stable as compared to the
 prior study, which may be due to chronic underlying lung disease.  Minimal
 left basilar atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
