  Right IJ catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  Swan-Ganz catheter
  and left-sided chest tube are not significantly changed in location.  Median
  sternotomy wires are intact.
  
  Lung volumes are low.  No pneumothorax.  Stable appearance of layering right
  pleural effusion.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, although
  aspiration or infection could have a similar appearance.  Stable postoperative
  cardiomediastinal contours.
