 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema.  No
 pleural effusion is evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged from
 prior examination.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, similar to
 prior.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 2.  Mild vascular congestion, though no interstitial edema
