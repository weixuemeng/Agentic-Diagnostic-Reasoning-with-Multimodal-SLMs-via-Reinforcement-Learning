 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the pleural effusions are
 seen in unchanged manner.  The precise extent of the effusions is better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The triangular
 configuration of the cardiac silhouette could suggest the presence of a small
 pericardial effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, minimal
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged alignment of the
 sternal wires.
