                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and numbers ___. 
 CT chest without contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  Sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiac
 silhouette is slightly decreased in size from prior, perhaps from resolution
 of the previously suggested pericardial effusion.  The mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
