                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is minor bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is no large
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
