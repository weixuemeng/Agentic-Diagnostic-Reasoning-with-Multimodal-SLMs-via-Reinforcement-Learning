                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new central line  // central line on left
 side in correct position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 04:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, there has been
 interval placement of a left-sided IJ catheter which terminates in the distal
 SVC.  ET tube is 4.8 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube extends to the
 stomach.  Right PICC line is unchanged in position, with the tip located in
 the distal SVC.
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  There are diffuse parenchymal opacities,
 more prominent in the bilateral perihilar regions, which suggests pulmonary
 edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted. There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions. No pneumothorax. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of support lines/devices as described above.
 2. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
