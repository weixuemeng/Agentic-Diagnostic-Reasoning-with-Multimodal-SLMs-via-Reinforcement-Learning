                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for lower lung
 volumes on the current exam.  With the exception of minimal atelectasis at the
 left base, lungs are grossly clear, and there are no definite pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces on the supine radiograph.  Within the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, there is improvement in gastric distention, but
 nasogastric tube tip continues to be directed cephalad, terminating in the
 fundus of the stomach.
