                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p fall +LOC, intubated, evaluate for injuries.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly limited evaluation due to overlying external artifacts. The
 endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned with the tip terminating 4.7 cm
 above the carina.  There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is likely due to AP technique and supine
 positioning. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely due to AP view.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no definite free air
 under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position terminating 4.6 cm above the
 carina.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
