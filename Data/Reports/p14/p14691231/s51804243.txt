                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness and acute renal failure.  Assess for pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___.  CT Torso
 ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post esophagectomy with gastric pull through and
 sutures are seen in the right perihilar region. The right lung is well
 expanded and clear. A homogeneous opacity in the left hemithorax is seen
 obscuring the left diaphragmatic surface and heart and is consistent with a
 large left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis, which is
 unchanged since ___.  Mild prominence of the right hilum is likely
 related to patient rotation. 
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen demonstrates multiple fluid-filled
 loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. The gastric pull-through also
 appears fluid filled. An enchondroma vs. infarct is noted in the left humeral
 neck. No interval change in the anterior wedge compression fracture in the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left pleural effusion is stable since ___.
 2.  Multiple air-fluid levels in the partially evaluated small bowel are
 concerning for small bowel obstruction.  If clinical concern, consider upright
 abdominal radiograph for further evaluation.
 3.  Stable multiple anterior wedge compression fractures of the lower thoracic
 vertebrae.
