  1. Increased opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left,
  likely represents atelectasis and/or aspiration. Pneumonia could be considered
  in the appropriate clinical setting.
  
  2. Endotracheal tube ends 4.9 cm from the carina.
  
  3. Wide mediastinum. Recommend correlation with prior radiographs, should they

 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased
 opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left, which likely
 represents atelectasis and/or aspiration, but pneumonia could be considered in
 the appropriate clinical setting. The mediastinum appears wide. The heart is
 not enlarged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube ends 4.9
 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the
 field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left,
