                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia, evaluate for acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A ___-mm heterogenous nodular opacity seen on the lateral view just
 posterior to the sternum was not present on prior radiographs.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are
 no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New ___-mm nodular opacity seen on the lateral projection could be
 a focus of infection or a pulmonary nodule.  If there is clinical concern for
 infection, recommend repeating chest radiographs after treatment.  If there is
 no concern for infection, recommend a dedicated chest CT for further
 evaluation.
