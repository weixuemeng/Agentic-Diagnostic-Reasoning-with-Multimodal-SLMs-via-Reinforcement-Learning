 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased consolidation in the right lower lobe with inferior displacement of
 the hilum likely reflects atelectasis and pneumonia.  New, small right pleural
 effusion.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Stable, mild blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects pleural scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe pneumonia with concurrent atelectasis and pleural fluid.
