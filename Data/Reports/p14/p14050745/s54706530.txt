 INDICATION:  Dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available at the time of report.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is ill-defined opacity which partially obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm as compared to the right and there is some opacification of the
 lower thorax on the lateral view.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG.  Incidental note is made of congenital
 bridging of the left anterior fourth and fifth ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at left base could indicate an early or developing
 pneumonia. Follow up CXR may be helpful in this regard.
