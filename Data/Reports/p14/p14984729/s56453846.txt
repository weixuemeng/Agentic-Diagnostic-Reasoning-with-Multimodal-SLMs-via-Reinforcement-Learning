                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Possible slight increase in left base opacity may be due to
 atelectasis, but early/very mild consolidation can not be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
