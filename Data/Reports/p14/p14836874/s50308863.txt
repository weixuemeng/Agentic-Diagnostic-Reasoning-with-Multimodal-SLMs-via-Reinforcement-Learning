                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Nipple shadows are again
 noted bilaterally.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Biapical, left greater than right pleural scarring is again
 seen, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
