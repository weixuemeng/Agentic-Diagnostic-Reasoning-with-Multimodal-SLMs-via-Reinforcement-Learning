 AP CHEST, 4:45 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with severe hypoxia, question pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs on ___, read in
 conjunction with intervening chest CT ___.
 
 Severe predominantly lower lung opacification has worsened over the past three
 days, as reflected in the progression seen on chest CT scans, ___ and
 ___, and the differential diagnosis is discussed in my report of the
 latter study.  Conceivably, there is some component of recoverable pulmonary
 edema accounting for the most recent changes, but I do not think that is the
 basic process.
