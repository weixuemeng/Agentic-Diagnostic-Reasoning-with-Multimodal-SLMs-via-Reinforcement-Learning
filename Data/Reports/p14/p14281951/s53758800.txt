                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post transbronchial biopsy, pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable upright chest of the patient and upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___ 2:40.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a right IJ line, ETT, and NGT, all unchanged in position as
 compared to the prior examination from the same day.  There is no convincing
 pleural line to suggest a pneumothorax.  The lungs otherwise demonstrate
 unchanged bilateral airspace opacities, more severe on the left than the
 right.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  No frank pulmonary
 edema is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definitive evidence of pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Stable appearance of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, likely
 representing an ongoing infectious process.
