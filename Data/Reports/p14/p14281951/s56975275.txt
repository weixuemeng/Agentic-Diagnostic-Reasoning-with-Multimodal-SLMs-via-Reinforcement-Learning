                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History endotracheal tube placement.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___, at 5:47 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned approximately 3.9
 cm above the carina.  Opacities involving all lobes of the lung, worse in the
 right lower and perihilar regions are stable.  Heart size is difficult to
 evaluate given the concomitant pulmonary opacities.  Nasogastric tube courses
 below the diaphragm into the stomach.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right
 internal jugular central line terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in standard placement. No signficant change in
 apperance of the lung parenchyma.
