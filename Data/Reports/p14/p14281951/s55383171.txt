                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:40 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman on mechanical ventilation.  Evaluate for ET tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Global consolidation involving all lobes, has worsened in the right lower and
 left perihilar lung since 4:29 a.m.  This could be due to a decrease in
 positive pressure ventilator support or supervening pulmonary edema as well as
 worsening of diffuse pneumonia.  Heart size is indeterminate because the right
 heart border is obscured.  Relative hyperlucency of the left apex has been a
 feature since the earliest chest radiographs in this admission, for example
 ___, when a CT scan showed no pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends low in the SVC and
 upper enteric drainage tube loops from the mid back to the upper stomach.
