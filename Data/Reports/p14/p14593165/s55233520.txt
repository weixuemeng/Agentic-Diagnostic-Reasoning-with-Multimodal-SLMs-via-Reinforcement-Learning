                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve and tricuspid valve
 replacements.  Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Small left
 pleural effusion has decreased in size compared to the previous exam.  Patchy
 airspace opacities in both lung bases, more so on the left may reflect areas
 of atelectasis however infection particularly in the left lower lobe cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, may reflect
 areas of atelectasis, however, infection particularly in the left lower lobe
 cannot be excluded.  Decreased small left pleural effusion.
