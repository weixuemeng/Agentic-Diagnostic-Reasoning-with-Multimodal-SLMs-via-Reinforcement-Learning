                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Findings are very similar to the prior examination and again suggest pulmonary
 venous hypertension with somewhat indistinct prominent upper zone
 redistribution of the pulmonary vascularity.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change; findings again suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension.
