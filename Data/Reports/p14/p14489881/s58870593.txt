 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild unfolding and calcification of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is
 normal in size.  In addition to coarse lung markings of uncertain chronicity,
 there is a patchy retrocardiac opacity.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.

 Retrocardiac opacity, possibly atelectasis but not specific.  Short-term
 follow-up radiographs are suggested if pneumonia or aspiration is a clinical
 concern.
