                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypertension, decreased lung sounds at the
 bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with a configuration that raises possibility of a subpulmonic
 effusion.  There is no left effusion.  Right basilar opacity is seen which
 could be due to atelectasis noting a component of infection is not excluded. 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Apparently elevated right hemidiaphragm with configuration raising possibility
 of subpulmonic effusion.  Lateral decubitus films could help clarify.  Right
 basilar opacity could be due to adjacent atelectasis noting that infection is
 not excluded.  Cardiomegaly.
