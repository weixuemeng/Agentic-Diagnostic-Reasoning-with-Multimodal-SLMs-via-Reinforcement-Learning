                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Torso CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, AFib,
 breast cancer, status post right mastectomy, with fever and lethargy, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP right frontal and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  The patient is rotated to
 the left, which somewhat limits evaluation, and on the lateral view, the
 patient's arm obscures the visualization through the chest.  There is blunting
 of the left CP angle which on prior CT is likely reflective of left basal
 pleural thickening.  The possibility of a superimposed small effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  The right lung remains clear.  The imaged portion of
 the left upper lung is clear.  Patient's rotation limits the evaluation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild blunting of the left CP angle is likely reflective of
 pleural thickening and possible small effusion.  Otherwise, unremarkable,
 though evaluation is markedly limited as stated above.
