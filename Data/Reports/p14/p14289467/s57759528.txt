                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Failure to thrive.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is redemonstration of prior midline sternotomy and CABG as well as a
 prosthetic aortic valve.  There has been interval removal of the previously
 seen left PICC.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is not significantly
 changed, likely secondary to scarring and a small pleural effusion.  There is
 no focal consolidation.  The heart size is upper limits of normal.  Mitral
 annular calcifications are noted.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of a
 small pleural effusion with scarring or atelectasis. No acute cardiac or
 pulmonary process otherwise noted.
