                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, new failure to thrive, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The semi-erect radiograph is slightly limited by positional
 factors.
 
 There is unchanged scoliosis and evidence of valvular replacement with sternal
 wires in situ.  Mild cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and a likely
 left pleural effusion.  On today's image, a minimal right pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  In the well-expanded areas of the lung parenchyma, there
 is no evidence of pneumonia or other pathologic parenchymal process.
