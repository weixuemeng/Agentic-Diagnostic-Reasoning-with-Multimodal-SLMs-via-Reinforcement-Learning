                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with widened mediastinum vs rotation on inital
 CXR.  // mediastinum stable or better?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT C-spine from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Previously reported widening of the mediastinum has
 improved, likely due to a tortuous thoracic aorta accentuated by patient
 rotation. Heart size is normal. Lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease in extent of mediastinal widening, likely due to accentuation of the
 tortuous aorta by patient rotation. No definite signs of mediastinal hematoma.
 However, if there is clinical suspicion for aortic injury, CTA of the chest
 would be recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 14:33.
