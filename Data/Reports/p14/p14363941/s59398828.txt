                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Found down, presumed assault, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Trauma radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Technologist note "the patient would not hold still for x-ray."
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared with the supine trauma board film obtained earlier the same day, the
 current film is also obtained supine, with slightly better, but still low,
 inspiratory volumes.  
 
 As before, the mediastinum appears prominent and there is probable mild
 cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis, slightly improved at the left base.  No effusion. No
 apical capping is suggested.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Continued concern for possible mediastinal enlargement.  However, the
 appearance is improved compared with earlier the same day.  This would be best
 further assessed with upright PA and lateral CXR views, when the patient is
 able to tolerate it. Alternatively, chest CT could help for further
 assessment.
