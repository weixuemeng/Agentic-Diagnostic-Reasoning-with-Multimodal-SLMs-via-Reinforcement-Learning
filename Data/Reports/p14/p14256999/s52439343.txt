 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is limited by lordotic positioning.  Lung volumes remain low. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
