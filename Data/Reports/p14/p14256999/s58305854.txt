                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and generally. However distortion of the apparent
 left heart border persists. It could be a scar or chronic atelectasis in the
 lingula or a rare pleural or mediastinal nodule.  If not already performed the
 patient should have an elective Chest CTA scan to exclude a small
 endobronchial mass or other active process. The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours and pleural surfaces are otherwise normal.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality. Particularly the patient's recurrent
 complaint of chest pain, it is important that attention be paid to a ___ year
 old abnormality in the lingula or adjacent pleura or mediastinum, with a Chest
 CTA, if not already performed.
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
