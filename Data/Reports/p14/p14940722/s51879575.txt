 evaluation for tip
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to portable study ___ at 10:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest ___ at 15:27 are submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian PICC line is seen terminating in the proximal SVC.  A
 feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over
 the stomach.  A single lead right-sided pacer has its lead terminating over
 the right ventricle.  Reported tracheostomy tube is not included on the study.
 There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia
 should also be considered.  No pulmonary edema.  Lung apices are not entirely
 included.
