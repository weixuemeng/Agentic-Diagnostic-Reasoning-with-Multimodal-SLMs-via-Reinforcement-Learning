 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes and a poor inspiratory effort. In comparison to
 prior radiograph, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable. As on prior study, bronchovascular prominence likely
 relates to low lung volumes. There is no evidence of focal lung consolidation.
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable chest x-ray. Limited by
 low lung volumes.
