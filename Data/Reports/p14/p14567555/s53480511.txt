                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, fever, recent
 bacteremia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 There has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema, likely with mild
 residual pulmonary vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged,
 probably representing relaxation atelectasis.  Left pleural effusion is small,
 possibly minimally larger.  New since the prior exam is a new small right
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improvement in pulmonary edema, possibly with mild residual vascular
 congestion.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are new on the right and
 slightly larger on the left.
 2. Unchanged left basilar atelectasis.  No new focal lung consolidation.
