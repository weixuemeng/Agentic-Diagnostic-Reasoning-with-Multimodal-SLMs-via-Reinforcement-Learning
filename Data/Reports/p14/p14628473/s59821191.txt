                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Indication: Status post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:
 Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 There is a persistent very small left apical pneumothorax. A left-sided PICC
 line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is status post
 coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable. A left-sided chest tube and mediastinal drains have
 been removed. Since the prior study there is new mild volume loss at the left
 lung base with upward tenting of the left hemidiaphragm and increased streaky
 opacification suggesting worsening of atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs remain
 clear. Trace pleural effusions are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 
 1.  Stable very small left apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Increased atelectasis at the base of the left lung.
