 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:42 AM
  New 5-mm left lung nodule, amenable to further evaluation with a non-emergent
  chest CT. At this time, the right lung opacity or old rib fracture could also
  be assessed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (PA and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with dyspnea,  cough, fatigue for 1
 week ; evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph exams dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight streaky retrocardiac opacity most compatible with atelectasis. A small
 5-mm opacity in the left lung between the third and fourth anterior ribs
 appears new from prior radiographs. Another opacity with in the right upper
 lung, projecting over the second anterior rib may represent an old rib
 fracture or nodule, and also appears new from the prior exam. No pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The heart size is enlarged, but
 overall unchanged from ___. The hila are unremarkable. Median sternotomy
 wires are again seen and appear intact.  Multi-level degenerative changes are
 noted in the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly without acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  New 5-mm left lung nodule, amenable to further evaluation with a
 non-emergent chest CT. At this time, the right lung opacity versus old rib
 fracture can also be assessed.
