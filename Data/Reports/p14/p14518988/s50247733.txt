                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with diffuse abdominal pain status post ERCP
 and stent placement.  Question bile leak.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Trace opacity in the left
 costophrenic angle is likely related to atelectasis upon correlation with
 subsequent CT.  A biliary stent is in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Left costophrenic angle
 opacification is consistent with atelectasis upon correlation with CT.
