 aspiration PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT terminates 4 cm above the carina.  There is an NG tube which courses
 below the diaphragm, however the tip is not visualized on this image.
 
 There is bibasilar opacification with air bronchograms, which appears more
 confluent in comparison to the prior chest radiograph.  Small left pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is stable.  Mediastinal widening due to lipomatosis is
 stable.  The hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube and NG tube in appropriate positioning.
 2.  Worsening bibasilar opacification, which now appears more confluent,
 likely due to aspiration pneumonia.
 3. Probable small left pleural effusion.
