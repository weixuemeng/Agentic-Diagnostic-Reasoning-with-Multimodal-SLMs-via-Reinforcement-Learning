 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest

 approximately 2.8 cm below the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, terminating in the at dislocation of the proximal stomach, side
 port is at the level of the GE junction.  Recommend advancement so that it is
 well within the stomach.  Low lung volumes persist.  Enlargement of the
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes is again seen, seen and seen to relate to
 mediastinal lipomatosis on subsequent CT.  There is increasing opacity
