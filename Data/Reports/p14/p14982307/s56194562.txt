                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory
 failure  // ETT tube placement, interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line remains
 malpositioned in the right internal jugular vein.  Lung volumes are decreased.
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mild to moderate pulmonary edema continue to be
 present.  The opacity at the right lung base is likely reflecting a
 combination of pneumonia and atelectasis.  No larger pleural effusions.
