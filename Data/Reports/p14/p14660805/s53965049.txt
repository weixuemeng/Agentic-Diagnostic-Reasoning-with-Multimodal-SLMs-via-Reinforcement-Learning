                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of chest were reviewed in comparison to
 prior radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular line has been removed.  Left descending aortic stent is
 seen in situ.  Since ___, the right lower lung opacity which was
 likely a combination of effusion and atelectasis has significantly resolved. 
 Mild amount of pleural effusion, however, still persists.  Right lower lung
 and middle lobe atelectasis is present.  Increased retrocardiac density
 reflecting left lower lung atelectasis and mild-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion are similar in appearance.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, right lower lung opacity which was
 likely a combination of atelectasis and moderate amount of effusion has
 significantly improved with mild residual fluid and minimal right basal and
 middle lobe atelectasis.  Left lower lung atelectasis and mild-to-moderate
 pleural effusion is unchanged.
