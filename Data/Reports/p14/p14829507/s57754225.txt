                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS resection mediastinal mass, please assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and outside hospital CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates abnormal rounded
 contour of the left upper mediastinum which is likely related to known
 mediastinal mass, better evaluated on the ___ CT, though mass
 appears larger than those depicted on CT. Hilar and cardiac contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident. 
 No osseous abnormality evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: Rounded border of upper mediastinum may correlate with known
 anterior mediastinal mass.  If this border does in fact correspond with mass,
 it appears larger than on chest CT performed ___.
