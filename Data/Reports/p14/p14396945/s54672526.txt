                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with minimal PMH presenting with DOE  // Evaluate
 for pulmonary edema versus pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, most
 confluent at the lung bases, but also seen in the upper lobes could relate to
 edema and ARDS, however, multifocal infectious process is not excluded.
 Underlying aspiration could also be present. There is bibasilar atelectasis.
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There also likely small to moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The aortic
 knob is calcified. Old right-sided rib deformities/prior fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities concerning for
 pulmonary edema /possibly ARDS, however, multi-focal infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Bilateral pleural effusions.
 Consider repeat radiograph after diuresis for further evaluation.
