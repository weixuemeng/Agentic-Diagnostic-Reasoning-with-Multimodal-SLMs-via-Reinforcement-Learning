                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette
 size is top normal, unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to the prior exam, causing mild
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No pulmonary edema is present. 
 Minimal streaky opacities are seen within both lung bases, likely atelectasis.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Old
 right-sided rib fracture is again noted.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
