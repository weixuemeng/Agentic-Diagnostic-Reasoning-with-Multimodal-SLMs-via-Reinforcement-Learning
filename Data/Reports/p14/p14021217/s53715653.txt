                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with temp pacemaker with runs of VT  // PM
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous study from earlier the same date, support and
 monitoring devices are similar in position.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild pulmonary edema are persistent findings.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is
 minimally improved with persistent adjacent small to moderate pleural
 effusion.  Large right pleural effusion appears increased but positional
 differences may contribute to this apparent change.
