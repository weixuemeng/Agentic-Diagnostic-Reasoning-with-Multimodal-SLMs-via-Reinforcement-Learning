 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M with NASH/EtOH cirrhosis
 Child-___ Class B, MELD ___, O+ blood type, complicated by
 diuretic-refractory ascites requiring bi-weekly paracenteses (prior ___
 shunt c/b infection s/p removal), variceal bleeding s/p banding in ___, and
 hepatic encephalopathy, PV/SMV thrombosis secondary to prothrombin gene
 mutation on warfarin, and spontaneous splenorenal shunt s/p embolization in

 acute process,edema vs infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated and lordotic positioning.
 
 There is is increased vascular plethora compared with prior film, consistent
 with CHF.  Patchy opacity left base could reflect atelectasis and/or scarring,
 but is slightly increased.  The extreme costophrenic angles are excluded from
 the film.  There are probable small left-greater-than-right effusions, similar
 to the prior study.  No new area of consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF, with interstitial edema, increased compared with 1 day earlier.
 
 Small left greater right bilateral pleural effusions again noted.
 
 Atelectasis at the left lung base.  This is slightly more pronounced than 1
 day earlier.  The differential diagnosis includes slight increase in the
 degree of atelectasis versus an early infiltrate.
