  1.  Left internal jugular central venous line ends in the right

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemodialysis line placement  // eval line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and
 diffuse vascular blurring the some confluent opacity at the right base. 
 Allowing for technical differences, this is likely similar to the film from ___ at ___:___ and is compatible with CHF.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with obscuration left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Probable small to moderate left and at least small right pleural effusions
 appear similar to prior.  Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left, appear
 more prominent as compared to the prior study.
 
 A right internal jugular Swan-___ catheter is present, with the tip ending in
 the region of the right main pulmonary artery, similar to prior.  There has
 been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous line, with
 the tip ending in the right brachiocephalic vein.  The endotracheal tube ends
 approximately 2.8 cm from the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central venous line ends in the right
 brachiocephalic vein.  This should be repositioned prior to use.
 
 2.  Findings compatible with CHF.
 
 3.  Left greater than right bibasilar opacities appear slightly more prominent
 as compared to the prior study.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with Dr. ___, ___D. by ___
 ___, ___D. on the telephone on ___ at 5:___ AM, ___ minutes after
