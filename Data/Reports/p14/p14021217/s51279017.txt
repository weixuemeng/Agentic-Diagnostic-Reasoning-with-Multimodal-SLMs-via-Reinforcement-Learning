                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is somewhat limited by patient rotation.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but not substantially changed in the
 interval.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal streaky right opacity in the right lung
 base likely reflects an area of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to patient rotation.  Minimal atelectasis in the right lung
 base.
