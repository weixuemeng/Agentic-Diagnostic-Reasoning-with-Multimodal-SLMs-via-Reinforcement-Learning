                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ___ shunt placement  // confirm shunt
 placement      confirm shunt placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the shunt appears to be in the mid portion of the SVC. There are
 low lung volumes with areas of increased opacification in the retrocardiac
 region. This most likely reflects atelectasis, although in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
