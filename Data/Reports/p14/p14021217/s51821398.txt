                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rising white count, shock  // eval pulm
 edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Markedly rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, a right IJ Swan-Ganz
 catheter has been placed.  The tip overlies a right inferior pulmonary.
 No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Cardiac silhouette appears larger than on the prior study.  In addition, there
 is new confluent increased retrocardiac opacity, with new obscuration of the
 left left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation. Obscured blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible
 with a left effusion.  Hazy density at the left base laterally could reflect
 either a layering effusion or additional atelectasis.
 
 There is evidence of CHF, with vascular plethora and vascular blurring.  There
 is focal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region less well seen due
 to patient rotation.  There is new hazy density in the right cardiophrenic
 angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter overlies the right inferior pulmonary
 artery.  Clinical correlation regarding retraction is requested.
 
 New left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and interval increase in
 bilateral effusions.
 
 Cardiac silhouette appears larger.  CHF again noted, probably similar prior.
 
 Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region is less well seen due to rotation,
 but likely remains present.
