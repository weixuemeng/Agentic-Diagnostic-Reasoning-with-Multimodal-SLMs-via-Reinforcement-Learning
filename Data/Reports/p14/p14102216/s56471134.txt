                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest discomfort and recent cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a moderate-to-large hiatal hernia with an
 air-fluid level, as before.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky left basilar opacity is unchanged and
 suggests atelectasis in associated with the hiatal hernia.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute disease.
