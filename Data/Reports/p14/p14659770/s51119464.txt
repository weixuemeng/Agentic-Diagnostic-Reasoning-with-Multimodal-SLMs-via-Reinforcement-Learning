                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: On the initial view of the chest, the right heart border appears to
 be obscured however on repeat imaging the right heart border is not obscured.
 There is however increase in the central bronchiovasculature which persists on
 both exposures.  The lateral film is unremarkable.  Cardiac size is normal. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of focal pneumonia. Central bronchiovascular
 prominence could represent reactive airways disease.
