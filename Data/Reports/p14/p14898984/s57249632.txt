 Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, no significant
 changes are appreciated.  Compared to 3 days prior, there has been development
 of mild interstitial edema. Heart size top-normal.  Pleural effusions small,
 if any.  Extensive pleural calcifications partially obscure portions of both
 lungs and somewhat limit evaluation for consolidations.  However, no focal
 consolidations are identified to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size top-normal. 
 Pleural effusions small, if any.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
