                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoking history, to assess for emphysema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD.  No acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 There is widening of the AC joint with slightly high position of the distal
 clavicle.  This raises the possibility of prior dislocation or surgery.
