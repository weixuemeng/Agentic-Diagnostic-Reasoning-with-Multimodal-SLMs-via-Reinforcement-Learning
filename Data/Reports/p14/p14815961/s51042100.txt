                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tbm  // chest tube placement      chest
 tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there are lower lung volumes.  There
 is a right chest tube in place without evidence of pneumothorax.  There is
 increased opacification in the left hemithorax, which has an appearance
 suggestive of asymmetric elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The
 possibility of a more coalescent opacification at the left base suggesting
 consolidation is suggested.
