                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post-operative // Observe for changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays from ___ to ___
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new left lower lung  opacity which appears to involve the inferior
 lingular segment, which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.There has been
 partial decrease in size of right subpulmonic effusion in comparison to prior
 exam. There is no left pleural effusion.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.   Additionally, there is a
 small area of sort tissue gas adjacent to the most lateral border of the right
 rib margins which is seen on multiple prior radiographs. This most likely
 represents a pocket of subcutaneous emphysema status post right thoracotomy,
 however, persistence on multiple examinations raises the possibility that this
 may represent focal lung herniation. This would be more likely in the presence
 of significant focal patient pain in the region. Otherwise, the lung
 parenchyma are grossly unchanged in appearance. There is stable biapical
 pleuroparenchymal scarring. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New inferior lingular segment opacity, ddx includes pneumonia and/or
 atelectasis.
 2.  Decreased size of right subpulmonic effusion.
 3. Focal lucency adjacent to right chest wall, likely subcutaneous emphysema
 status post right thoracotomy, however, concern for focal lung herniation
 exists given stable appearance on multiple chest x-rays.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 16:10, approximately 20 minutes after discovery.
