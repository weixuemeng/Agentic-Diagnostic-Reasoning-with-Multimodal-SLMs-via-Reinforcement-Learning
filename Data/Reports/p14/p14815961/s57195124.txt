                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period. 
 Persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with possible subpulmonic
 component, accounting for lateral peaking of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
 definite pneumothorax.  Focal opacities centrally in the right juxtahilar
 region may reflect atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting. 
 Additional patchy and linear foci of atelectasis are present in both lower
 lungs, and note is made of a persistent small left pleural effusion.
