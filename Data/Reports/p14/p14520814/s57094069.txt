                                 FINAL REPORT
 Status post left VATS, chest tube placed, now short of breath.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 CHEST, AP:
 
 Position of the chest tube is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is positively
 identified.  Low lung volumes are again noted but some opacities are seen
 particularly in the left mid zone and pneumonic consolidation or aspiration
 could be present in this region.  The degree of failure may be present, but
 this is hard to evaluate in the presence of low lung volumes.  Extensive
 spinal hardware is present.  Gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are
 present indicating probable ileus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable left-sided aspiration pneumonia.
