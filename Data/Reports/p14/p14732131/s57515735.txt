                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough. Hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse
 hazy ill-defined opacities are noted within both lungs.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse hazy ill-defined opacities within both lungs with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Findings may reflect a multifocal pneumonia with
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema, although given the history of hemoptysis,
 hemorrhage is not excluded.
