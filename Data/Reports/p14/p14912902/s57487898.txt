                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral nodular opacities are seen throughout the lungs compatible
 with metastases.  When compared to most recent prior there is more dense right
 basilar opacity which could represent superimposed infection. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Right Port-A-Cath is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More dense right basilar opacity superimposed on diffuse metastatic disease. 
 Findings could represent an effusion, atelectasis and/or superimposed
 infection.
