 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic cancer and resp failure.  //
 Please eval for progression of pneumonia.      Please eval for progression of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 13:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 05:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic
 disease.  There is an increasing right pleural effusion and increasing
 consolidation at the right base which may reflect compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A right internal jugular
 Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely not changed although difficult to
 assess due to the diffuse pulmonary metastases.
