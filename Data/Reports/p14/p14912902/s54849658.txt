                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 The mediastinal contour appears relatively unchanged with known necrotic
 lymphadenopathy better assessed on the previous CT.  Enlargement of the hila
 bilaterally corresponds to known necrotic lymph nodes.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm persists and likely
 reflects the presence of a small pleural effusion.  Innumerable metastases are
 seen throughout the lungs, increased from the previous chest radiograph, but
 similar when compared to the recent CT.  Patchy right basilar opacity may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable pulmonary metastases, as seen on the previous CT.  Continued
 bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better
 assessed on the previous CT.  Chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 with small right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, likely
 atelectasis.
