                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right chest wall port
 terminating in the low SVC and an unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 Diffuse rounded opacities throughout the bilateral lungs are again seen, some
 increase in size compared to the most recent chest radiograph.  It would be
 difficult to detect a focal consolidation given these underlying opacities.  A
 right pleural effusion is similar to slightly decreased in size.  There may be
 a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
