                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post craniectomy, now with fever to 103.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest was obtained with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No definitive focal consolidation is identified.  The right cardiophrenic
 angle is somewhat obscured, although this is likely secondary to the AP view
 and/or crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  The remainder of the
 examination is essentially unchanged as compared to prior radiographs dated ___.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 identified.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definitive radiographic evidence to suggest an acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
