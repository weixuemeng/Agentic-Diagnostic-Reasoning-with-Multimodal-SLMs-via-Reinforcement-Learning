                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fall, head injury,
 chest pain, rib pain, and right side of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable and
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.  If clinical concern for rib
 fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No displaced rib fracture seen.
 If clinical concern for rib fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series
 for better evaluation for rib fractures.
