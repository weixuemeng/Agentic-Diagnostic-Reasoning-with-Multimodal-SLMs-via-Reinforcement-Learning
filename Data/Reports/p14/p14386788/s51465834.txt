                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a focal opacity in the lingula.  Otherwise, the remainder of the
 lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is normal.  There is no evidence of an
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular opacities most likely representing pneumonia.  Other etiologies are
 not excluded and a followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended to
 ensure resolution.
