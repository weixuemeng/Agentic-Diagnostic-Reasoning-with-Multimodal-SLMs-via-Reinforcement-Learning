                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Complete heart block, question acute findings in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Multiple
 overlying wires are present.  The lungs appear essentially clear though right
 CP angle is excluded.  A lucency below the right hemidiaphragm could represent
 air within loops of bowel though free air cannot be excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable given patient
 rotation and/or technique.  Bony structures are intact.  Partially imaged
 hardware in the lumbar spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, no acute findings in the chest.  Lucency below
 the right hemidiaphragm, question free air versus air within bowel.  Recommend
 left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen to further assess.
