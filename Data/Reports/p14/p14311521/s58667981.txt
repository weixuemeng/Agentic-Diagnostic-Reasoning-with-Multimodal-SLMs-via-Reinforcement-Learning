 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after dual-chamber pacemaker placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses from a left subclavian approach.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unrelated.  A colonic interposition between the right
 hemidiaphragm and the liver should not be mistaken for free air.  Heart size
 is normal.
