                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with central line placed in the left IJ.  Confirm
 line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed two hours prior to this study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular
 central line, which is seen crossing the midline.  Given patient rotation,
 position of the catheter tip is limited although it appears to terminate in
 the region of the left brachiocephalic vein or the superior SVC.  Otherwise,
 there has been no significant interval change with prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left IJ central line seen crossing the midline and
 terminating either within the left brachiocephalic or the upper SVC.
 Evaluation limited due to rotated position.
