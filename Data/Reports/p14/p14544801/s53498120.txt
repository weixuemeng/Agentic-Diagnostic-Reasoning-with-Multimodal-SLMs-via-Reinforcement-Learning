                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known right lung abscess status post IVF
 for renal failure.  Evaluate interval change status post fluids.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  CT of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal semi-erect view of the chest was obtained.  Left internal
 jugular central catheter terminates in stable position, across the midline, in
 either the upper SVC or the left brachiocephalic vein.  Known right upper lung
 abscess is not clearly visualized on this radiograph due to semi-erect
 position.  Diffuse right hemithorax opacification remains, though aeration of
 the right lung appears slightly improved.  The left costophrenic angle is
 excluded on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in aeration of the right hemithorax, although
 diffuse opacification of the right hemithorax persists.  Known cavitary lung
 abscess is not clearly visualized on this semi-upright radiograph.
