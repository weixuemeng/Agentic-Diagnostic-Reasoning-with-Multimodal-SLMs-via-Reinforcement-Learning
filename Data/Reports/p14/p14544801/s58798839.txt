 INDICATION:  Patient with metastatic lung cancer, now with left-sided chest
 pain on palpation, located anteriorly; please assess for bone versus chest
 etiology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-___ ___ ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Non-displaced anterior fifth left rib fracture is new.
 
 Necrotic cavitating right upper lobe mass with air-fluid level was better
 assessed in previous chest CT.  Bibasilar opacities are mostly compatible with
 aspiration or pneumonia.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The patient is known with right upper lobe lung cancer that has cavitated
 with bilateral basal opacities that could be compatible with aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 2.  Left fifth anterior rib fracture is new.
