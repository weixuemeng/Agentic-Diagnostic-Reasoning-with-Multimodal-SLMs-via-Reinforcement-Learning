                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-healing left lower extremity transmetatarsal amputation to
 undergo left BKA, preop.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 There is hyperinflation suggesting background COPD.  The right hemidiaphragm
 is slightly elevated.  There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, likely
 multichamber, which is unchanged compared with ___.  Also again seen is
 aneurysmal dilatation of a calcified descending aorta.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  Again seen is linear scarring in the left
 mid zone.  No gross pleural effusion.  No obvious pneumothorax.  Prominence of
 the left main pulmonary artery is again noted and could reflect presence of
 pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Background COPD.
 
 2.  Moderately severe cardiomegaly is stable compared with ___.
 
 3.  Aneurysmally dilated descending aorta, also unchanged.  Based on studies
 available on PACs, this has never been assessed for possible dissection.
 
 4.  Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
 
 5.  Atelectasis, but no focal consolidation or gross effusion.
