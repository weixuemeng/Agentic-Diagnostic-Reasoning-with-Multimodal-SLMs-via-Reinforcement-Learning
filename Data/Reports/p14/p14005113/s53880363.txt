                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain following assault, here to evaluate for rib fracture
 or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  There is elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to low lung volumes and elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm, but is likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  A
 healed fracture at the right lateral eighth rib is noted. No acute displaced
 fracture of the rib is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.
