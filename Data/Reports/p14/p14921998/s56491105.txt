                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe sepsis without clear source, question pneumonia after IV
 fluid resuscitation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is a more distinct opacity with air
 bronchograms in the right cardiophrenic region, likely reflecting a pneumonic
 infiltrate.  Patchy opacity at the left base medially in the region of the
 cardiac silhouette is slightly more distinct, but not significantly changed. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film.  There is minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle which is new, without other evidence
 of effusion.  Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  More indistinct opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is
 concerning for a pneumonic infiltrate.  Patchy opacity at the left base could
 reflect either atelectasis or a small infiltrate, and is more distinct, but
 grossly unchanged.  Both opacities appear significantly progressed compared
 with ___.
