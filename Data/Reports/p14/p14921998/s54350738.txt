                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis and aspiration risk.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The lung
 volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Posterior basilar opacity in
 the left lower lobe could be seen with atelectasis or possibly aspiration.  A
 left mid lung opacity has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy posterior left basilar opacity, probably due to
 atelectasis, although a small focus of aspiration is possible.
