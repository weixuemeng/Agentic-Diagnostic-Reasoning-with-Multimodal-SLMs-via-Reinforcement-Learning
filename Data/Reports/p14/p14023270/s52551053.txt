 HISTORY:  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___ blind.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has not worsened since ___. 
 Consolidation at the right lung base, more obvious, but not necessarily
 worsened, could be asymmetric edema or pneumonia.  Left lower lobe is also
 airless, most commonly due to atelectasis, early in the setting of severe
 chronic cardiomegaly  like this.  Mediastinal venous distention indicates
 right heart component of CHF.  Endotracheal tube in standard placement.  An 
 Upper enteric tube can be traced as far as the low esophagus but the tip is
 not distinct.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC line ends at the origin
 of the SVC.
