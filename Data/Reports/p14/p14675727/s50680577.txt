                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Most recent prior studies are not available for comparison.
 
 Current examination demonstrates bibasal consolidations, involving both lower
 lobes appreciated on both PA and lateral views.  The aorta is severely
 distended as demonstrated on the prior examination and might be aneurysmatic. 
 The upper lungs are essentially clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion is
 seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Pulmonary nodules were suspected on the prior
 examination but currently not detectable, most likely due to consolidation.
