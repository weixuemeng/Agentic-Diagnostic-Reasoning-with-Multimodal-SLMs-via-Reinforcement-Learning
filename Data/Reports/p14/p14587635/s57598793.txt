                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  There are lower lung volumes
 which, in association with the AP portable technique, accentuate the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Lungs are clear without vascular congestion
 or pleural effusion.
 
 Of incidental note again are old healed rib fractures on the right.
