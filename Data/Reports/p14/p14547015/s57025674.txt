  ETT ends 3.5 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes exaggerate the size of the
  mediastinum and limits evaluation of the mediastinum. Diffuse mild hazy
  opacities in the lungs bilaterally may be due to low lung volumes.  Bibasilar
  opacities may represent ateletasis or aspiration.  No pneumothorax or large
  pleural effusion.

  ETT ends 3.5 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes exaggerate the size of the
  mediastinum and limits evaluation of the mediastinum. Diffuse mild hazy
  opacities in the lungs bilaterally may be due to low lung volumes for slight
  volume overload. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia and ICH.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT ends 3.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube extends to the left upper
 quadrant though the tip is excluded from view. Portable supine technique
 limits evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Lower lung opacities
 are noted likely representing atelectasis and possible aspiration. No acute
 bony injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriately positioned NG and ET tubes. Limited exam due to portable supine
 technique. Bilateral lower lung opacities likely atelectasis/aspiration.
