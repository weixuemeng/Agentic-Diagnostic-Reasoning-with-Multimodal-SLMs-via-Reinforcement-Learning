                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  There is a faint opacity within the left lung base which is most
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild atelectasis in left lung base.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of pneumothorax or congestive
 heart failure.
