                                 FINAL REPORT
 Dizziness and unsteadiness, multiple cavernomas on MRI, rule out acute lung
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Moderate scoliosis causes asymmetry
 of the rib cage.  No acute lung parenchymal process, in particular no evidence
 of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  On the lateral radiograph only, a small area
 of atelectasis is seen at the left lung base.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  Mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
