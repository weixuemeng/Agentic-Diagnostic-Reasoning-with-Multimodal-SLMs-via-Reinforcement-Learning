 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains markedly enlarged.  There has been interval removal of the
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  Mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There has been interval appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary and
 interstitial edema.  Increasing retrocardiac consolidation may reflect a
 component of compressive lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering
 effusion or merely be related to the edema.  Linear opacity in the left mid
 lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
