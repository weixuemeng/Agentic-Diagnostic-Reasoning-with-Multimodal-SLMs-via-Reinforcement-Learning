 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:18 PM
  Comparison is made to prior study performed on the same date approximately 1.5
  hours prior.  An endotracheal tube is identified, its tip approximately 7 cm
  above the level of the carina.  For more appropriate positioning, this can be
  advanced approximately 2 cm.  A right internal jugular catheter is present,
  its tip which terminates in the distal superior vena cava.  A left internal
  jugular central catheter projects at approximately the same location.  Median
  sternotomy wires appear intact.  A prosthetic valve is noted.  Mediastinal
  clips project over the left mediastinal border.  A large left pleural effusion
  is not significantly changed in size since prior study.  Partially imaged
  right hemi thorax appears better aerated with probable pulmonary edema.  An
  enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip below level
  of the hemidiaphragm.
  
   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the
  telephone on ___ at 8:16 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with interval intubation  // ___ year old man with
 interval intubation      ___ year old man with interval intubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared a chest radiographs ___ through ___:41.
 
 Tip of the newly placed endotracheal tube is more than 7 cm from the carina an
 should be advanced at least 2 cm, depending upon chin position.
 
 Large left pleural effusion which developed between ___ and ___ is no
 smaller, concerning for empyema or hemothorax, is responsible for left lower
 lobe collapse.  It obscures the left heart border, but cardiomegaly is still
 at least Severe.  Moderate volume of opacification at the right lung base
 could be largely atelectasis, and is due in part to posterior pleural
 effusion, but is very concerning for pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Left jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view.
