 along the thoracic midline to the upper abdomen though the tip is out of the
 field of view.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. 
 Right upper lobe consolidations consistent with pneumonia.  Hilar congestion
 and likely mild interstitial pulmonary edema present.  Cardiomegaly again
 noted.
