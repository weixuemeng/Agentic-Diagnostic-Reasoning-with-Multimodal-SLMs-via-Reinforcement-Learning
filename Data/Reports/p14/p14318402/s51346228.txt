                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right chest discomfort.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no significant change compared with the prior radiograph. 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Chain suture is seen in the right upper lung,
 compatible with prior resection.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 likely due to volume loss in the right.  There are no focal opacities.  There
 is a prominent epicardial fat pad with partial obscuring the left heart apex,
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
