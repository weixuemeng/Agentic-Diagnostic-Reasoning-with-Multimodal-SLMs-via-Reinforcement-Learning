                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided PICC is seen, distal aspect not well appreciated, but likely
 terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC.  A right-sided port is also again seen
 terminating at the low SVC/cavoatrial junction.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated, which may be due to COPD.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is
 no focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  A catheter is seen partially imaged overlying the
 imaged left upper abdomen.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
