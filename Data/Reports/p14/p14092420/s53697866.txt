                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again with leads seen in satisfactory position in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and somewhat tortuous.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle raises concern for a trace right pleural effusion.  There is also linear
 left base retrocardiac scarring/chronic atelectasis, similar to prior.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated which may relate to COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Trace blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion.
