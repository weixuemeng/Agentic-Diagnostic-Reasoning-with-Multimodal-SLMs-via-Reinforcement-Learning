 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Systolic heart failure, status post thoracocentesis, questionable
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 decrease of the right pleural effusion after thoracocentesis.  The remaining
 effusion is limited to the costophrenic sinus.  There is mild opacity at the
 right lung base, potentially representing re-expansion edema.  The right lung
 shows no pneumothorax.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
