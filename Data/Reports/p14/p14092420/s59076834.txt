                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest tightness, dizziness, and history
 of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been no significant
 interval change.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 is again seen.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles on lateral view only is
 seen, likely secondary to known small pleural effusions or pleural scarring
 from prior pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.
 Aortic calcifications are again noted.  Dual-chamber pacemaker leads and
 hardware appear similar in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiographs.
