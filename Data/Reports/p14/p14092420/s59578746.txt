                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, recurrent pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new opacity at
 the right lung base that obscures the heart border and the right
 hemidiaphragm.  The opacity is likely caused by a combination of effusion and
 atelectasis.  The opacity occupies about one-third of the right hemithorax.
 
 Marked cardiomegaly with borderline diameter of the pulmonary vascular
 structures, potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.  No evidence of
 left-sided effusion.  Left pectoral pacemaker in situ.
