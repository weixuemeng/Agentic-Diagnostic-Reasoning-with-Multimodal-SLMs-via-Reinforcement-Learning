 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SDH, pneumonia, now resolving  // Interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:53

 Again seen is an NG tube, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  Also
 again seen is a left subclavian PICC line, with tip near the cavoatrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are lower and the patient is more kyphotic than on the
 prior study.
 
 Cardiac contours are obscured by surrounding pleural fluid and consolidation. 
 As before, the aortic arch is appears expanded and calcified, similar in
 configuration.  The trachea is deviated to the right.  Aneurysmal areas of the

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New  moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Moderate left effusion underlying collapse and/or consolidation is similar to
