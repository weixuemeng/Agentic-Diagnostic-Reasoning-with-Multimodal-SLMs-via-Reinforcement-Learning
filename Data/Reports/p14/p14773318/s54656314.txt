                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F hx SDH now p/w tachypnea, o2 sat ___% on ___% tent mask,
 5L NC.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been some interval re-expansion of the the right lower lobe,
 although it remains consolidative with alveolar edema.  The left lower lobe is
 still completely collapsed.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are not
 significantly changed since the prior study.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous
 with calcifications at the arch.  Mild pulmonary edema is also present. 
 Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate.  A left upper extremity PICC
 terminates at the mid to lower SVC.  The tip of the enteric tube is not
 clearly identified.  Spinal fusion hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval slight re-expansion of the right lower lobe with significant
 residual consolidative edema.
 
 2.  Complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
 
 3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
