                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SDH and hip fracture with increasing O2
 requirement  // acute pulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New right middle and lower lobe collapse, notably where the enteric tube was
 mistakenly initially placed in the prior radiographs, before appropriate
 advancement into the stomach.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved and a
 new small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged.  Marked dilation of the
 aortic arch with rightward tracheal deviation is unchanged.  Heart size is
 normal.  Visualized cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are otherwise
 unremarkable.  An enteric tube passes below the diaphragm and outside the
 field of view.  Median sternotomy wires and lumbar fusion hardware are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right middle and lower lobe collapse.  Probably unchanged left pleural
 effusion and improved left basilar atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The primary team was not notified as subsequent examination
 available at the time of this study interpretation demonstrated interval
 intubation with lung reexpansion.
