                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F with SDH, w/ tachypnea, labored breathing  // interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Partial collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe with air
 bronchograms may represent mild re-expansion alveolar edema versus right
 basilar pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion may have slightly improved.
 Opacification of the left lung has increased consistent with worsening left
 pleural effusion.  The status of the underlying left lower lung is difficult
 to assess in the setting of an obscured cardiomediastinal silhouette as
 mediastinal shift is also difficult to assess.
 Left sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  The tip of the enteric tube is not
 clearly identified.  Spinal fusion hardware and median sternotomy wires are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The presence of air bronchograms within the partially collapsed right
 middle and right lower lobes may represent mild re-expansion edema versus
 pneumonia.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
 2. Small right pleural effusion may have slightly improved.
 3. Worsening left pleural effusion opacifies the left lower lung.
 4. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be assessed limiting assessment for
 mediastinal shift and left lobar collapse.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:39 AM, 10 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
