  1.  Postoperative chest.  Mild mediastinal widening is stable since ___ study from 04:30 however has minimally increased since study
  performed at 09:00 and may be related to patient rotation.  Given history of
  recent evacuation of mediastinal and pericardial hematoma clinical correlation
  is recommended to assess for re-accumulation of hematoma.
  2.  Left lower lobe heterogeneous opacity is most consistent with superimposed
  soft tissue from left breast implant.
  3.  Interval decrease in right basilar pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p bentall AVR cabg  // eval ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position including bilateral chest
 tubes.  The small right basilar pneumothorax is decreased.  There is again
 seen mediastinal widening which appears relatively stable.  There is increase
 density to the left lower lobe due to superimposed breast implant.  No
 definite consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is seen.
