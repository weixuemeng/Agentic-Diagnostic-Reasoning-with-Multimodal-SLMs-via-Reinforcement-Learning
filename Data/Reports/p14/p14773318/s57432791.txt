                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___F s/p Bentall for type A aortic
 dissection, on Coumadinwho present as a transfer after sustaining unwitnessed
 fall atrehab with subdural hematoma and midline shift.  // prior to am rounds-
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Again seen are sternotomy wires.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly unchanged.  The aorta is calcified and the aortic arch is slightly
 dilated measuring approximately 4.2 cm.  The rounded contour overlying the
 right heart border, with thin curvilinear calcifications apparently represents
 the known dilated lower thoracic aorta.  Calcification and suspected
 dilatation of the abdominal aorta is also noted.
 
 There is hazy density overlying the lower left chest.  Though much of this may
 relate to the overlying breast implants, the possibility of retrocardiac
 density with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and a small left
 effusion is suspected.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  The right lung is
 grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or gross effusion.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 An NG type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A
 single surgical clip is seen at the right upper lung laterally.
 
 Note is made of fusion hardware in the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with ___.
 
 Suspect left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion,
 not significantly changed.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help
 to further assess the left lower lobe.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including dilated, calcified visualized
 portions of the thoracic aorta are similar to the prior film.
 
 The ET tube has been removed.  The NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film.
