  Significant rightward rotation of the patient limits the evaluation.  Enteric
  tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, right internal jugular central venous catheter,
  pleural and mediastinal drains all appear in satisfactory position. 
  Evaluation of the lungs and heart is limited by rotation.  There is no
  evidence of large pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Significant rotation limits assessment.  Overall, the monitoring equipment
 appears unchanged in position with a right internal jugular catheter,
 Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, a pleural and mediastinal tube in-situ.
 It is difficult to follow the precise course of the nasoenteric tube but this
 appears to terminate in the stomach.  No pneumothorax seen.  A left breast
 prosthesis partially obscures the central area of the chest.  There may be a
 small left pleural effusion but this area is difficult to assess.
