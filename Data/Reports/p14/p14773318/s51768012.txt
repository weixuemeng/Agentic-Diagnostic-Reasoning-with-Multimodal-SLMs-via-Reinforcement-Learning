 Freestyle) cabg x1(svg->dRCA)___ Chest closure ___, s/p evacuation
 hematoma ___  // s/p evacuation of hematoma, 4 chest tubes placed (2 pleural,
 ___ mediastinal)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph from several hr earlier, a right basilar
 pneumothorax is newly appreciated with indwelling chest tube.  Interval
 decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours likely reflects provided
 history of evacuation of hematoma.  Note is also made of improving bibasilar
 atelectasis and decreasing pleural effusions.  Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 withdrawn to the level of the main pulmonary artery.  No other relevant
 changes since the recent study.
