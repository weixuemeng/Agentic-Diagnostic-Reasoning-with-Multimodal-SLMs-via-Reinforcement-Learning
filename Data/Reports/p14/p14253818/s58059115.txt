                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough; question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 chest appears mildly hyperinflated.  There are areas of mild peribronchial
 cuffing in the mid-to-lower lungs which may be associated with airway
 inflammation, but there is no focal consolidation.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation and suggestion of peribronchial cuffing which may
 indicate an inflammation of lower airways, but not striking; correlation
 regarding any possibility of reactive airway disease is suggested.  No
 evidence of focal consolidation.
