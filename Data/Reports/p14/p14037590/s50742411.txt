                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Cardiac silhouette is somewhat prominent, possibly due in part to the
 low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or
 pleural effusion.  
 
 The central lines are essentially unchanged.
