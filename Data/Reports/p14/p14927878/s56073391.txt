                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax or fracture, in a patient status post
 trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs which are without
 focal consolidation.  Although patient positioning is suboptimal for the
 evaluation of pneumothorax or pleural effusion, neither is appreciated on this
 exam.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note, however, the patient
 positioning is suboptimal for the evaluation of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
