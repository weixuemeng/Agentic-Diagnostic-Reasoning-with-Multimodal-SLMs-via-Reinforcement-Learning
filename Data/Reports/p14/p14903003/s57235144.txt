                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, pseudomonas bacteremia and left pleural
 effusion status post thoracentesis.  Please assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is in place with tip terminating in the
 lower SVC, unchanged.  The focal opacity at the left lung apex, which was seen
 previously is slightly more dense.  There has been left-sided thoracentesis
 with reduction in size of the now small left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion is slightly increased.  Right lung
 remains clear.  Osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Decreased size of left-sided pleural
 effusion following thoracentesis.
 
 2.  Increased density in the left lung apex suggestive of infectious process,
 for which repeat radiography is recommended to ensure resolution after
 treatment.
 
 3.  Slight increase in size of a small right-sided pleural effusion.
