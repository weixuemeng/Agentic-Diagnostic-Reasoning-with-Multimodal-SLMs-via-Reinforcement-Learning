                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Advanced colon cancer, presenting with weakness, nausea, vomiting,
 and diarrhea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___.  More recent
 chest CT studies are also available from ___ and a CT of the
 abdomen from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion, similar to perhaps increase since the prior
 abdominal CT.  However, much of the apparent left basilar opacification is
 associated with moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
 probably atelectasis.  There is no evidence of free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacification suggesting pleural effusion in
 combination with parenchymal opacification and elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Parenchymal opacification is compatible with associated
 atelectasis, although it is difficult to entirely exclude a coinciding
 infectious process.
