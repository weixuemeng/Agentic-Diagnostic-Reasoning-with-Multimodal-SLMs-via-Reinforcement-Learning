                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, question left
 lower lobe infiltrate on CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Comparison is made to previous
 exam from ___ and abdominal CT from the same day.  
 
 Linear opacities again seen in the mid lungs bilaterally, less significant
 compared to prior and suggestive of atelectasis.  There is minimal
 retrocardiac patchy opacity as seen on CT scan from earlier the same day. 
 There is no large confluent consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy opacity in the left lower lobe, better appreciated
 on CT scan and may represent infection in the proper clinical setting.
