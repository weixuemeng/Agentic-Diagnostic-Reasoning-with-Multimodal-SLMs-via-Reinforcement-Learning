                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion, abdominal pain, melanic
 stools.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam, which accounts for the
 slight increase in size of the cardiac silhouette.  Heart size does appear
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified at the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.  There are likely small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac patchy opacity is likely reflective of atelectasis.  Probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
