 INDICATION:  History of left arm paralysis.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph of the chest performed earlier at 2am on the same
 day. CTA Head and Neck from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Note is also made of diffuse bilateral
 interlobular septal thickening, which could be secondary to patient's
 pulmonary edema, however an atypical infection or potential interstitial lung
 disease should also be considered.  There is a new focal consolidation seen at
 the right lung base.  There is a .9-cm nodular opacity at the mid right lung,
 as well as a .6-cm nodular opacity at the left lung base. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral interstitial septal thickening; this could be secondary
 to pulmonary edema, however an atypical infection or potential interstitial
 lung disease should also be considered.
 
 2. New focal opacity overlying the right lung base, potentially atelectasis
 however infectious process is not excluded.
 
 3. Nodular opacities overlying the mid-right lung, and left lung base, for
 which a non-urgent CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
