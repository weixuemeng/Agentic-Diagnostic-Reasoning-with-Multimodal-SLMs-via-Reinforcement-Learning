  Well-defined 1.5 cm nodule abutting but not obscuring the right mediastinal
  margin is of unclear etiology and no comparison study is available.  Further
  assessment with CT chest is recommended.  Other small nodules just superior to
  the right cardiophrenic angle may be assessed at that time.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with generalized weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A 1.5 cm well-defined rounded nodule
 is seen abutting but not obscuring the right mediastinal margin at the level
 of the right hilum. Nodular opacities seen above the right cardiophrenic angle
 correlate with a retrocardiac opacity in the lateral view. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Well-defined 1.5 cm nodule abutting but not obscuring the right
 mediastinal margin is of unclear etiology and no comparison study is
 available.  Further assessment with CT chest is recommended.  Nodular and
 patchy retrocardiac opacity just superior to the right cardiophrenic angle may
 represent pneumonia and can be assessed with the CT.
