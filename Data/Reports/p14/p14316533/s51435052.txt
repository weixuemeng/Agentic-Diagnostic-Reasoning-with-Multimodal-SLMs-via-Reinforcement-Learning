 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, breath sounds, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As in the previous examination, there is unchanged hyperexpansion
 of the lungs and relatively subtle increasing interstitial structures,
 creating a reticular pattern, notably in the perihilar and peripheral lung
 regions.  However, there is no evidence of superimposed pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema, or acute lung pathology.  No pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or
 masses.  Calcified granulomas in the left apex are unchanged.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.
