                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female presenting with known sternal fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT torso from ___ at 22:09.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low though without
 confluent consolidation.  Basilar linear opacities may be due to
 underinflation, though early pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No vascular congestion or large pleural effusions are evident. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits without evidence of
 developing mediastinal hematoma.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  A
 known sternal fracture is not well evaluated on this single frontal chest
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of mediastinal hematoma.
 
 2.  Known sternal fracture, not well evaluated on this single frontal view.
 
 3.  Low lung volumes, though early basilar mild pulmonary edema cannot be
 excluded.
