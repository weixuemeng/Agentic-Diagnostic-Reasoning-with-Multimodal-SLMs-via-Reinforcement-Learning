                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with HIV, CD4 at 182 of ___% six month
 ago.  Anxiety disorder, now newly on HIV treatment three times a week with
 Atripla.  Several days fever as high as 100.5, night sweats, dyspnea.  Right
 pectoral region discomfort, cough productive of yellow sputum.  Is there
 right-sided pneumonia? hilar lymphadenopathy? evidence ___ ___ or TB?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Available for comparison is the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  On the present examination, the heart size is within normal
 limits, and no configurational abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  On the right lung base and located in the
 posterior segment of the right lower lobe, there is a discrete parenchymal
 density indicative of a pneumonic infiltrate.  There is no pleural reaction
 and the right lateral as well as posterior pleural sinus is free from any
 fluid accumulation.  The left lung base is unremarkable.  On the frontal view,
 one can identify, in the right apical area, some scattered small parenchymal
 infiltrates overlying partially the proximal clavicular area and reaching the
 apical pleural space.  The left apical area appears free, and no pneumothorax
 is present.
 
 Comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___ enables one to
 clearly identify the right lower lobe pneumonia as being new.  Similarly, the
 right apical area was clean on the preceding examination.  One can also see
 that there are some linear densities from the right hilum into the direction
 of the right apical area.  The appearance of the lesion, although not typical,
 raised the possibility of specific tuberculous infection.  Noteworthy is that
 on the preceding examination in ___, the heart size was considerably larger
 than it is now, although it might still have been within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New acute infiltrates in right lower lobe posterior segment and
 additional right apical lesion raising the possibility of specific infection. 
 Further followup is indicated.  Referring physician,  ___, was paged but
 was not listed.
