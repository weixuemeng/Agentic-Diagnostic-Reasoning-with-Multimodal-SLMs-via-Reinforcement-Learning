                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with high grade lymphoma, with worsening
 "breathlessness." // Question of pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low causing bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for this,
 there may be increased bibasilar interstitial opacities. This could represent
 early pulmonary edema or possibly early multifocal pneumonia. There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion and the heart size is normal.  The right-sided
 PICC line extends into the right atrium, and should be withdrawn 5 cm. There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possibly increased bibasilar interstitial opacities, early pulmonary edema
 or possibly early multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Right-sided PICC line ends within the right atrium and should be withdrawn
 5 cm.
