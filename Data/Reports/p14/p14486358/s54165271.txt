 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic right inguinal melanoma.  Right lower extremity
 cellulitis.  Fever and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Tiny punctate opacities in the lower lungs are probably pulmonary granulomata.
 Lateral view suggests granulomatous calcifications in the left hilus.  There
 are no larger soft tissue nodules identified with certainty in the lungs, but
 CT scanning would be required to exclude them, particularly if there is
 concern about pulmonary metastasis.  There is no evidence of central lymph
 node enlargement or consolidation.  Lateral view shows a small right pleural
 effusion, new since ___.  The indentation on the right side of the
 cervical trachea is most commonly due to an enlarged thyroid, but
 lymphadenopathy is an alternative explanation.  Heart size is normal.  Dr.
 ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
