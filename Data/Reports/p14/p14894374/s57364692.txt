                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The aorta shows mild tortuosity and calcification. The heart is normal in size
 allowing for technique. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The lungs appear clear. Vague retrocardiac opacity is most likely due to minor
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence for pneumonia. Vague retrocardiac density that can
 probably be explained by atelectasis.
