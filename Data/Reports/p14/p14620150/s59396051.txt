                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of decreased oxygen
 saturation, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A dual-lumen
 left-sided central venous catheter is again seen, limited to end at the right
 atrium and cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomegaly persists with mild pulmonary
 edema somewhat improved.  There may be a trace right pleural effusion. 
 Relative increased opacity at the lung bases most likely relates to overlying
 soft tissues and atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild improvement in the
 mild pulmonary edema.
