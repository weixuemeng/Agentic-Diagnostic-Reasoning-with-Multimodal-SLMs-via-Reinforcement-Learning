                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Transfer from outside hospital, history of mitral regurgitation. 
 Questionable fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is moderate cardiomegaly with mild
 pulmonary edema.  In addition, relatively extensive bilateral areas of
 opacities are seen that could be atelectatic, but could also represent
 pneumonia.  These opacities are more severe on the right than on the left.  No
 pleural effusions.  A double-lumen left-sided central venous access line.
