  1. R PICC tip at superior RA/caval atrial juction - if ectopy an issue,
  retracting 2-3 cm may be considered.
  2. low lung volumes w/ bibasilar atelectasis; continued moderate L pleural
  effusion w/ associated atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected left lower lobe pneumonia versus pleural
 effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___ chest radiographs.
 
 The patient is after median sternotomy and replacement of the mitral valve. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 The left PICC line is too low, in the right atrium and should be pulled back
 approximately 2.5 cm.
 
 On the left, there is an evidence of loculated pleural effusion with adjacent
 area of lucency most likely representing the spared lung in between two areas
 of loculation.  Focal consolidation with central cavitation is substantially
 less likely.  Followup of the patient with chest radiographs to assess dynamic
 changes is recommended.  Alternatively, a chest CT even without administration
 of IV contrast can be obtained for precise characterization of loculated
 pleural effusion and for   exclusion of infectious process in the left lung.
