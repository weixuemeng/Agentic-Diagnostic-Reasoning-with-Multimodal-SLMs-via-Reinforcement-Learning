                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  There is a
 dual-lumen venous catheter terminating at the upper aspect of the right
 atrium, as before.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  Slightly
 prominent central pulmonary vascularity appears to represent a baseline
 finding but is slightly more prominent.  A left retrocardiac opacity persists
 and obscures the left hemidiaphragm posteriorly.  This is suspected to
 primarily represent pleural effusion with atelectasis, also noting slight
 thickening of all fissures suggesting mild fluid overload.  It is difficult to
 completely exclude an infectious etiology, however.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Persistent small left-sided pleural effusion with patchy posterior left lower
 lobe opacity.  Pulmonary opacification may be due to atelectasis associated
 with persistent effusion, but an infectious etiology is not entirely excluded
 by this study.
