 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure and hypotension requiring fluid boluses. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:08 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows unchanged right internal
 jugular and left PICC lines.  The right internal jugular central venous
 catheter persists in the high right atrium.  Compared to prior radiograph, the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pleural effusions.  The opacity that was seen at the left base
 has improved in the interim and was likely atelectasis.  There is no acute
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular catheter persists in the high right atrium.
 2.  Unchanged cardiac silhouette with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.
