                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, follow up pleural effusion after
 dialysis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Right pleural effusion has decreased in amount, now small.  It is associated
 with a large atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  A stent in the
 right subclavian vein is again noted.  Multiple surgical clips are present in
 the upper abdomen.
 
 Left pleural effusion has resolved.  The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged
 as before.
