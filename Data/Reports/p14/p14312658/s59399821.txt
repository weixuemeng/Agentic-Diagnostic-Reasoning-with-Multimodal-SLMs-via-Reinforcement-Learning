 silhouette is borderline enlarged.  The bilateral hila are within normal
 limits.  There are low lung volumes.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without pulmonary edema.  Right cardiophrenic angle opacity likely
 reflects crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  Equivocal trace right pleural
 effusion.
