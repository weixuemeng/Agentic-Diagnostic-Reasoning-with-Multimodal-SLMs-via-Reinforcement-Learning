                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CHF, moderate AS, CAD, CKD p/w dyspnea and weight gain
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires are
 again noted.  Hilar congestion is noted with mild pulmonary edema.  There is
 slightly increased opacity in the lower lungs which raises potential concern
 for atelectasis versus an early pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and edema.  Lower lung subtle opacities may
 reflect atelectasis though difficult to exclude an early pneumonia.
