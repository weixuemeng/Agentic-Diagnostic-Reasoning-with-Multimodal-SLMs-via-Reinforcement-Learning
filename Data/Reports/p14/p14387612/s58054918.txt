                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with progressive dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm appears to be chronic.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild atelectasis at the lung bases.
