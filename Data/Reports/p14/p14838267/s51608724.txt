                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequently obtained CT chest 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  The endotracheal tube
 terminates 6 cm above the carina.  An enteric catheter loops in the fundus of
 the stomach.  Cardiomegaly is severe.  Additional widening of the upper
 mediastinum is attributable to fat. Small pleural effusions and subsegmental
 atelectasis are better seen on the subsequently acquired CT.  The aortic arch
 is extensively calcified.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal vascular
 clips are in expected positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions better seen on subsequently acquired CT.
