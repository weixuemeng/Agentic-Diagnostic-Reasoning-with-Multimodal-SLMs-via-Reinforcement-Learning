 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 
 FINDINGS: There is cephalization of pulmonary vessels, with perihilar
 haziness, vascular indistinctness consistent with moderate pulmonary edema,
 worsened since prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 Bibasilar opacities are noted, which likely represent atelectasis.  The
 cardiac silhouette is obscured by the pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires, CABG clips, and cholecystectomy clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema, which has worsened since prior exam.
