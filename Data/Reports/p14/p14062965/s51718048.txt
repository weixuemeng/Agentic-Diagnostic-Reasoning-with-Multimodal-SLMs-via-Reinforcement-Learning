                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, cough and sputum
 production.  New onset of dyspnea and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The bilateral perihilar opacities
 with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen throughout.  Blunting of
 posterior costophrenic angles suggestive of effusions.  Linear opacity in the
 region of the minor fissure suggests fluid within the fissure versus potential
 adjacent atelectasis or other cause of consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette
 appears enlarged likely exaggerated by poor inspiratory effort.  Dense mitral
 annular calcifications are noted as well as atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aorta which is tortuous.  Multiple compression deformities are noted
 throughout the thoracic and likely lumbar spine which are age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of congestive failure noting a superimposed infection is
 also a possibility.
 
 Multifocal compression deformities within the spine which are age
 indeterminate and clinical correlation suggested.
