                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:25 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Severe aortic stenosis, treated with porcine AVR ___ years ago. 
 Recurrent CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 4:18 a.m.:
 
 Severe pulmonary edema has improved.  Asymmetric distribution raises the
 possibility of concurrent pneumonia, but all the findings could be due to
 edema since there has been a relatively substantial improvement over just four
 hours.  Moderate right pleural effusion stable.  Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax.
