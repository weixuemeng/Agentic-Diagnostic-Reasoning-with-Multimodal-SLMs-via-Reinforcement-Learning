  Persistent bilateral perihilar opacities and interstitial pulmonary vascular
  markings suggestive of congestive heart failure.  In the appropriate clinical
  setting, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  
  
  Recommend short interval followup after treatment to document resolution.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old woman with CAD, worsening dyspnea.  Rule out infiltrate,
 edema, effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes remain
 low. There has been interval improvement of a linear opacity at the right
 minor fissure.  However, bilateral perihilar opacities with indistinct
 pulmonary vascular markings persist.  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic
 angles could be related to pleural fluid.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral perihilar opacities and indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings suggestive of congestive heart failure.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Recommend short
 interval followup after treatment to document resolution.
