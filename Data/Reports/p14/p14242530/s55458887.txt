                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  A 1.8 cm nodular
 opacity overlying a mid-thoracic vertebral body on the lateral view has no
 corresponding abnormality on the frontal view and could represent an
 paraspinal or osseous lesion.  No diffuse pulmonary abnormality.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 2.  Indeterminate 1.8 cm nodular opacity overlying a mid-thoracic vertebral
 body (on lateral view only).  Non-emergent CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 
 Findings were communicated via email to the ED QA nurses.
