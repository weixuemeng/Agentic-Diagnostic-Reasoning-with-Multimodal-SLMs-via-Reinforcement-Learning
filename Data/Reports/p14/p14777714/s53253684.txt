                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new left-sided PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is persistent retrocardiac
 opacity consistent with atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  There has
 been slight interval improvement in the degree of right pleural effusion,
 which may be due to patient positioning. Pulmonary edema has resolved.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses
 into the stomach and out of the field of view.  A left-sided PICC line ends at
 the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
