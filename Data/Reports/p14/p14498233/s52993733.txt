 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change since the prior study. 
 Minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could be due to trace

 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No definite new focal
 consolidation is seen.  Mild vascular congestion persists.  No pneumothorax.
