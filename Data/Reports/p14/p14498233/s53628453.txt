                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There
 are several right lateral rib fractures.  For example, involving the right
 lateral third rib as well as the fifth, sixth and potentially the seventh
 ribs.  These may be old; however, clinical correlation is suggested.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right-sided rib
 fractures, which appear old; however, clinical correlation is suggested.
