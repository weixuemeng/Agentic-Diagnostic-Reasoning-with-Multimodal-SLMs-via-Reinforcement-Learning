                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mediastinal contours are stable. 
 The hila and pulmonary vasculature are less prominent as compared to the prior
 study consistent with interval decrease in pulmonary edema with possible
 minimal pulmonary vascular congestion remaining.  There is minimal blunting of
 the posterior costophrenic angles which may be due to very trace pleural
 effusions.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Evidence of old right-sided rib fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with significant interval decrease in pulmonary
 edema with possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion remaining.  Slight
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may be due to trace effusions.
