 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature is
 consistent with mild interstitial edema, similar to prior.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also similar to prior.  A rounded right mid lung opacity
 is similar to prior and consistent with a chronic rib fracture.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild interstial edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
