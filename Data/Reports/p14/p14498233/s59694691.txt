                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain status post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Multiple old right-sided
 rib fractures are seen.  No displaced left-sided rib fracture is seen,
 however, if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, suggest a dedicated rib
 series, which is more sensitive.  Areas of linear increase in opacity
 projecting over the lateral left hemithorax may be artifactual, however again,
 if there is high concern for a fracture, suggest dedicated rib series.
