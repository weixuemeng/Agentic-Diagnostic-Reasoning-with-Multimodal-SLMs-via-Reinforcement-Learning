                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung carcinoma with increased shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the multiple pulmonary nodules
 are not definitely appreciated.  There is increased opacification in the left
 apical region with patchy opacification above the minor fissure and continued
 opacification in the right costophrenic angle consistent with pleural fluid
 and atelectasis.  Widening of the upper mediastinum and hilar region again is
 consistent with the patient's known malignant disease.
