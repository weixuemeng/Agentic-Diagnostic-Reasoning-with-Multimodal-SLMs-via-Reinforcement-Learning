                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs of the chest available from ___ as
 well as more recent CT torso examination from three days earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The scout view of the recent prior chest CT can be directly
 compared to the current radiographs.  The recent prior CT, which was performed
 to assess metastatic disease, showed multiple pulmonary nodules and a moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion, also evident on this examination.  It is
 difficult to precisely compare to the scout view allowing for differences in
 technique, but there is no definitive change.  Overall, volume loss of the
 right hemithorax including elevation, mild-to-moderate degree of the right
 hemidiaphragm is probably similar.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Bony structures were better evaluated on the recent
 prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting widespread metastatic disease as seen on
 recent prior examination.  There is no definite change allowing for
 differences in technique.  However, given background opacification and
 difficulty comparing different techniques, if symptoms were to persist, then
 short-term followup standard PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful to
 evaluate further.
