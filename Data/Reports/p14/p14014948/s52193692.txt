                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PEG issues  // any new issues?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Free air is again seen beneath the diaphragm. However, this appears decreased
 in amount compared with ___. Oral contrast again noted in the
 visualized portion of the colonic splenic flexure. The G-tube itself is
 excluded from this film.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Upper zone redistribution is
 similar but the overall degree of vascular plethora may be very slightly
 decreased. Minimal atelectasis or scarring noted in the right mid zone
 laterally. No focal infiltrate or effusion identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent free intra abdominal air, but decreased in volume compared with
 ___.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, but degree of vascular plethora has also
 probably decreased.
 3. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
