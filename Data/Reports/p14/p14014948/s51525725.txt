 Right upper lobe atelectasis has improved, but there may be new collapse of
 the middle lobe elevated against the minor fissure.  Right lower lobe
 consolidation, presumably another region of atelectasis, is stable.  Left lung
 remains clear.  Heart size is normal.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.
 Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place ends just beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced 5-10 cm for more secure
 seating.  Left subclavian line is been removed.  Left PIC line ends just above
 the superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.
