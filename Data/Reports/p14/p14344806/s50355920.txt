                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diabetic, presenting with chest pain that is worse with
 breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient became dizzy after the PA image and the lateral view
 was thus obtained with the patient on stretcher.  Frontal and lateral views of
 the chest were obtained.  There is left lower lobe patchy opacity which is
 worrisome for pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia or
 aspiration.
