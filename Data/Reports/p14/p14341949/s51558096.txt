 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pulmonary artery is quite large, and its size and shape have fluctuated

 embolus or fluctuation in pulmonary artery pressure due to volume loading and
 left heart dysfunction. There was no embolus on a chest CTA performed ___ which however showed considerable mucoid impaction in both lower lobes,
 especially the left.  That may serve to explain persistent consolidation at
 the medial aspect of the left lung base.
 
 Since  ___ moderate left pleural effusion has increased.  Heart size
 is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube and left PIC line are
 in standard placements respectively.
 The only suggested complication of new tracheostomy is slight in the right
