                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo F with unknown PMH presenting after being found down at
 base of stairs with multiple traumatic injuries  // assess for acute
 intrapulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, endotracheal tube is been successfully
 repositioned and nasogastric tube is been advanced with side-port now below
 the GE junction level. Recently described left lower lobe opacity has
 partially improved with small residual opacity in the retrocardiac area.
 However, new poorly defined right lower lobe opacities have developed. These
 findings may be due to old multifocal aspiration. Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing infectious pneumonia.
