                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low which resulted in
 vascular crowding.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal, but unchanged from prior study of ___. 
 Again noted is bilateral apical pleural opacifications which likely represents
 extrapleural deposition given patient's body habitus.  Clips are again seen
 overlying the cervical region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiothoracic process.
