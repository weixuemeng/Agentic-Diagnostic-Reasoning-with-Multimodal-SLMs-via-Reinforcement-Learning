                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with congested cough despite treatment with Z-Pak
 ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Multiple clips are demonstrated about the
 thoracic inlet with slight deviation of the trachea to the right compatible
 with prior thyroidectomy and residual left thyroid nodule, better demonstrated
 on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal left basilar patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.
