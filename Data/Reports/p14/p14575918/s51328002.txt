                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with 50-pack-year smoking history, now with chronic
 hypoxia and polycythemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  The lung volumes are preserved; however, there
 are diffuse generalized increased interstitial markings. There is no pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings which may represent early
 interstitial or fibrotic lung disease. Especially given extensive smoking
 history,  CT scan is recommended to better characterize these findings.
