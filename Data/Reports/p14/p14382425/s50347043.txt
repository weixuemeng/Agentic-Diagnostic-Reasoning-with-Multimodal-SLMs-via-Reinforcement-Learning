                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension  // eval for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided AICD is stable in position.  Enlargement of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable to possibly minimally
 increased.  Left base opacity and partial obscuration of left hemidiaphragm
 could be due to atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen.  There is persistent
 mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
 vascular congestion, grossly stable.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 may be due to overlying soft tissue or small pleural effusion and atelectasis.
