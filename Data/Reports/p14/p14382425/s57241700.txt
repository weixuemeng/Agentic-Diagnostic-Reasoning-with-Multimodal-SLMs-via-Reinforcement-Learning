 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:58 AM
  
  
  
  
  1. There is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter which appears to enter the right
  pulmonary artery, requiring repositioning.
  2. Left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads projecting over the
  right atrium and ventricle in grossly appropriate location.
  3. Stable cardiomediastinal contours.
  4. Pulmonary vascular congestion and likely mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
  5. Left basilar atelectasis.
  6. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
   The findings regarding malpositioned Swan-Ganz/PA catheter were already known
  to the CCU team at the time of this dictation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, transferred from OSH w/ cardiogenic
 shock, has R ___ cath.  // ___ cath positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with tip overlying the right pulmonary artery --
 as indicated in the wet reading, this is known to the covering team.  Left
 chest cardiac device with leads projecting over the right atrium and
 ventricle; additional leads overlie the superior border of the left heart,
 unchanged compared with ___.
 
 There is marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Also again seen is prominence of the
 main and? right pulmonary arteries.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 diffuse vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  This is
 increased compared with the prior film.   There is bibasilar atelectasis. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of the left heart border. 
 Allowing for this, no gross effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  Clips noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 2. Vascular plethora consistent with CHF and left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 3. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlying right pulmonary artery.  Please
 see wet reading.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  There is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter overlies the right
 pulmonary artery, requiring repositioning. The findings regarding
 malpositioned Swan-Ganz/PA catheter were already known to the CCU team at the
 time of the wet reading dictation.
