                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with a history of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF
 ___% s/p recent biV ICD placement (___), s/p recent embolic Rt MCA CVA
 (___) w/Lt sided hemiparesis   prior stroke ___ on Coumadin due to LV
 thrombus, MR, HTN, HLD, admitted to CCU from OSH w/worsening cardiogenic shock
 and possible VAD vs IABP placement.  // Acute interval changes
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly with prominent the main pulmonary artery and probable
 prominence of the right hilum is unchanged.  Again seen is a multi lead
 pacemaker, unchanged in configuration.  Also again seen is a right IJ
 Swan-Ganz catheter.  On the current examination, the tip of the Swan-Ganz
 catheter lies quite distal, possibly near the origin of the lower lobe
 vessels.  No obvious pneumothorax identified.
 
 In the right lung and left upper/ mid zones,there is upper zone redistribution
 mild vascular plethora, and diffuse vascular blurring. I suspect that some of
 the blurring reflects respiratory motion. Allowing for this, the distribution
 of these findings is similar.  The right lung base remains grossly clear,
 without consolidation or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip lies relatively distal.  Clinical correlation regarding
 retraction is requested no given the distal positioning.
 
 Possible increased vascular blurring, though I suspect that much of this this
 is artifact due to respiratory motion.  Otherwise, doubt significant interval
 change.
