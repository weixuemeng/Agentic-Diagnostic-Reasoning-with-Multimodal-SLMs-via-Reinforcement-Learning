                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea  // please assess for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 20:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, degree of distension of the esophagus may be
 somewhat less.
 
 Marked cardiomegaly is similar to the prior film.  Increased retrocardiac
 density is also similar, though the left hemi diaphragm is very faintly
 visible on the current film.
 
 Again seen is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF.
 
 On the right, there is some increased perihilar density, possibly an artifact
 of the cardiomegaly or esophageal distension -- otherwise, no focal
 consolidation on the right and no gross effusion.
 
 The pacemaker device and its leads are similar to the prior study.  Slight
 difference in configuration of the right atrial lead is likely accounted for
 by differences in the patient rotation.
 
 On the current study, the left mainstem bronchus appears smaller in caliber
 than on the right, unchanged compared with the prior film.
 
 Again noted are multiple clips overlying the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly slightly improved. 
 The possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate in the left lower lobe cannot be
 excluded.
 2. Marked cardiomegaly and mild CHF.
 3. Pacemakers and leads probably unchanged -- please see comment above.
 4. Degree of distention of the esophagus appears less.
 5. Apparent smaller caliber of the left mainstem bronchus compared to the
 right, unchanged.
