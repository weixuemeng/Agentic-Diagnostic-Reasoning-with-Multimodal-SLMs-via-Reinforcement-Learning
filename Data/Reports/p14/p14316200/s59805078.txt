                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING FINALIZATION OF THIS REPORT, ADDITIONAL REVIEW
 OF THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUS CHEST X-RAYS WAS PERFORMED.
 
 OF NOTE, THERE IS  VERY SLIGHT PROMINENCE OF THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM ON THE
 PATIENT'S INITIAL CHEST X-RAY FROM ___, WITH INTERVAL INCREASE ON
 SUBSEQUENT FILMS.
 
 WHILE THE APPEARANCE ON TODAY'S EXAMINATION IS IN KEEPING WITH FINDINGS ON THE
 MOST RECENT 2 STUDIES, WHEN COMPARED TO THE CHEST X-RAY FROM ___, THE
 CURRENT APPEARANCE OF THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM IS QUITE PRONOUNCED, WITH A
 PROMINENT ROUNDED CONTOUR.
 
 GIVEN THE INTERVAL INCREASE IN SIZE AND UNCERTAIN ETIOLOGY, FURTHER ASSESSMENT
 WITH CHEST CT IS RECOMMENDED TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE THE NATURE THE
 ABNORMALITY.
 
 THESE FINDINGS AND CONCERNS WERE DISCUSSED BY DR. ___ WITH THE COVERING
 PHYSICIAN, ___. ___,  BY PHONE APPROXIMATELY ___ MIN AFTER DISCOVERY, AT
 9:36 P.M. ON ___.  NOTE IS MADE THAT, BY REPORT, THE PATIENT IS UNABLE
 TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS FOR HOLDING STILL AT THIS TIME AND WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE
 SUPERVISION FOR SAFE TRANSPORT.

 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:07 PM
  
  
  
  A right IJ line terminates in the region of the mid SVC.  Widening of the
  superior mediastinum is unchanged from multiple prior examinations.  No
  pneumothorax.

  A right IJ line terminates in the region of the mid SVC.  Widening of the
  superior mediastinum is unchanged from multiple prior examinations.  No

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man just self-pulled back central line  // eval
 position of CVL
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ line is present.  The tip now overlies the mid/ distal SVC,
 retracted compared with the most recent prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinal silhouette is noted, but in keeping with
 findings on multiple prior studies.
 
 CHF findings and bibasilar atelectasis have improved somewhat compared with
 the prior film.  Increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, remains present.  Small
 left-greater-than-right pleural effusions may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ line has been retracted compared with 1 day earlier, but the tip of
 the line is in satisfactory position in the mid/distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  Mediastinal widening is again seen, but is not appreciably changed
 compared with multiple prior films.
 
 Interval improvement in CHF, with mild upper zone redistribution still
 present.
 
 Residual bibasilar atelectasis and left lower lobe collapse or consolidation
 remains present.
 
 Possible small left-greater-than-right effusions.
