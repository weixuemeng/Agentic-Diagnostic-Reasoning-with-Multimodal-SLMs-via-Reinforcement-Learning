 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 Linear opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectasis.  There is a 1 cm
 nodule projecting over the left lung apex.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Lateral left clavicular fracture is partially visualized, better seen on
 concurrent shoulder films.

 necessary.
