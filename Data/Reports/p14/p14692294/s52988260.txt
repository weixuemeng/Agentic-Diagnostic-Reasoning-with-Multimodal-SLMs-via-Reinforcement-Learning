                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung volumes
 result in bronchovascular crowding.  Opacity at the right lung base may
 represent infection or atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Right hemidiaphragmatic elevation is unchanged. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged with aortic tortuosity. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Right basilar opacity may be pneumonia or atelectasis.
