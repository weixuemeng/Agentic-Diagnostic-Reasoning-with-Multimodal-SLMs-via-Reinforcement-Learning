                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with stat intubation.  Assess endotracheal tube positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with increased cephalization of vasculature and new
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Right costophrenic angle is not fully
 imaged.  Persistent mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  The main pulmonary
 arteries are enlarged as before, suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. No
 pneumothorax.  NG tube tip is not well visualized
 
 An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.  Partially visualized
 posterior spinal fusion hardware noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Progression of moderate pulmonary edema with new small bile pleural
 effusions, persistent cardiomegaly and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 2.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
