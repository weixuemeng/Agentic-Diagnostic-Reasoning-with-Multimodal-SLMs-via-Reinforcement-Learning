 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 seen to the level of the mid esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent moderate pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly and enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 2.  Right IJ CVL tip in low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Enteric feeding tube tip seen to the level of mid esophagus which may be
 artifactual due to overlying parenchymal abnormality.  If concern for enteric
 tube displacement consider repeat radiograph for further evaluation.
