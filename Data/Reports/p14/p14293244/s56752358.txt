                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough for 1 week and right sided rib pain //
 cough for 1 week and right sided rib pain r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant interval change. The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. 
 Flattening of the diaphragms, best appreciated on the lateral view, is overall
 unchanged and suggests chronic pulmonary disease.  The heart is normal in
 size.  The mediastinum is not widened. The hila are within normal limits. 
 Calcifications of the aortic knob are unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are
 also grossly unchanged.  Increased interval aortic valve calcifications.
 Bilateral coronary stents are intact. Moderate multi-level degenerative
 changes with anterior osteophytes are not overall similar if not slightly
 progressed in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.  Probable chronic pulmonary disease.
 2. Increased aortic valve calcifications.
 3. Note that conventional chest radiograph is suboptimal for detection of rib
 fractures. If clinical concern is high, return for dedicated rib films with
 ___ in region of interest is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ ___, the referring provider requesting ___ wet read, on the telephone
 on ___ at 3:27 PM, after discovery of the findings.
