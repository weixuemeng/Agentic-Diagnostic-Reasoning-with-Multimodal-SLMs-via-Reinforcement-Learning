                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided pleural effusion, status
 post thoracocentesis with 650 mL evacuated on ___.  Evaluate for
 recurrence of effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size, mediastinal
 structures, and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits and unchanged. 
 Again noted is the mild degree of left lateral pleural blunting extending
 mildly into the posterior pleural sinus.  When comparison is made with the
 preceding study, the amount of pleural effusion remains small and is
 practically unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed, and no new infiltrates
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of recurrent pleural
 effusion.  The small amount of low density is similar to what has been seen
 post thoracocentesis performed on ___.
