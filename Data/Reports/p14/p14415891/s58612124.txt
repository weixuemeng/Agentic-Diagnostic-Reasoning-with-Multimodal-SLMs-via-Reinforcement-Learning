                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recurrent left effusion.  Reevaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is
 little change in the blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely due to a
 small pleural effusion, pleural scarring, or a combination of the two.  There
 is no right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in the blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, possibly due to a small pleural effusion, pleural scarring, or
 combination of the two.
