                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:22 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, hypotension, and
 possible consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and mild upper lobe vascular redistribution persists but
 there is no pulmonary edema, and no lung findings worrisome for appreciable
 pneumonia.  There is some mild peribronchial opacification in the right lower
 lung, which could as easily be due to mild atelectasis or aspiration.  To be
 safe I would repeat a  chest radiograph in 12 hours if there is still any
 clinical concern for pneumonia.
 
 The upper enteric feeding tube loops in the stomach and ends in the fundus.
