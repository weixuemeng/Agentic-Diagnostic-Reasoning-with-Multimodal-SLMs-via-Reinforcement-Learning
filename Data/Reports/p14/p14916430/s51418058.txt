                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Right-sided PICC line is seen with tip in the mid SVC.  An
 enteric tube seen coiled in the stomach and extending into the expected region
 of the duodenum.  Appearance of the lungs is not significantly changed given
 lower inspiratory effort on the current exam.  Bibasilar opacities are again
 seen, more extensive on the left than on the right.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bibasilar opacities likely in part due to atelectasis
 but component of consolidation/possible infection suspected on the left.
