 HISTORY:  Lethargy, hyperglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy
 opacity is seen within the left lung base, possibly reflective of atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity most likely reflective of atelectasis.  Infection
 however is not completely excluded.
