 HISTORY:  New crackles on examination, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portal frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged from the immediate prior exam, but
 is slightly increased compared to ___ with associated central
 vascular congestion and upper zone vascular redistribution, compatible with
 early failure.  There is no frank pulmonary edema.  Lungs are clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The previously identified opacity at the
 left costophrenic sulcus has cleared and was likely atelectatic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The previously identified opacity at the left costophrenic sulcus has
 cleared and most likely was atelectatic:
 2.  Slight increase in severe cardiomegaly compared to ___ with
 prominent pulmonary central pulmonary vasculature, compatible with early
 failure without frank edema.
