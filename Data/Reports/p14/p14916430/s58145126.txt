 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:17 PM
  Bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, are improved but not
  resolved. Linear portions suggest a component of atelectasis, but underlying
  infection cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
  detected. Interval removal of esophageal catheter. PICC tip projects at level
  of high SVC/junction with right brachiocephalic vein, perhaps slightly
  retracted compared to prior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with ETOH cirrhosis with shortness of breath, chest
 pain.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Bibasilar opacities, left better than right have improved consistent with
 improving atelectasis, superimposed infection though cannot be totally
 excluded.  There has been interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.  There
 is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.  Right PICC tip is in the upper
 SVC, slightly higher from prior study and with the loop proximal to the end.
