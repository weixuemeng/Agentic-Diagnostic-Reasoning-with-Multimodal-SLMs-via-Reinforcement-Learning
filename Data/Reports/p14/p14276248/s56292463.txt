                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ich, intubated  // eval ett and ogt
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Oblique positioning, probably slightly RPO.
 
 The upper mediastinum is slightly underpenetrated and the tubes are not well
 seen. Allowing for this, I identify a single tube with its tip approximately
 4.7 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. This is in
 nominal position for an ET tube. No definite and OG-tube is identified .
 
 The cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged. The level of the diaphragms of
 the obscured. There is hazy opacity in the right lung suggesting a layering
 right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The upper and
 mid zones of the left lung are grossly clear, without CHF. There is
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation. The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
 No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Background degenerative changes noted in the spine, not fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Only a single tube is visualized -- this appears to represent the ET tube,
 nominal in position. Clinical correlation regarding the OG tube is requested.
 2. Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The differential diagnosis
 includes marked cardiomegaly and a pericardial effusion.
 3. Layering right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 4. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The upper portions of left
 lung are grossly clear, without overt CHF.
