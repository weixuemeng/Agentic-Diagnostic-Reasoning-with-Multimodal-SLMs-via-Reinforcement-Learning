                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right-sided chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The patient is rotated toward
 the left somewhat limiting assessment of the mediastinal contours.  Hilar
 fullness is appreciated bilaterally.  Additionally opacity in the retrocardiac
 region is present.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion consistent
 with early heart failure; retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis,
 although in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia could not be excluded.
