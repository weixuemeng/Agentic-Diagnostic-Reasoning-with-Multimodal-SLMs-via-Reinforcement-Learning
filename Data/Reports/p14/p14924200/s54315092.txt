                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, low-grade temperature.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is seen.  Opacity at the right lung base could relate to atelectasis, although
 an underlying early consolidation not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinum is
 unremarkable.
