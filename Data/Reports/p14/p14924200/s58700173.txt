                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Substernal chest pain and cough.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral radiographs were acquired.  Lung volumes are
 low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary
 vasculature. Lung bases are suboptimally assessed on frontal view due to
 underpenetrated technique.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Haziness
 of the right lower lateral left lung likely is secondary to underpenetration.
 No focal consolidations.  Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Otherwise, no acute cardiac or pulmonary
 process.
