                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Decreased mental status and oxygen desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta
 demonstrates mural calcifications.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Ill-defined patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect an
 area of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar patchy opacity likely reflective of atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.
