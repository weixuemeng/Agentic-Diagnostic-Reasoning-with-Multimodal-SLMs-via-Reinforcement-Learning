                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sore throat, fever, and productive cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are low,
 slightly exaggerating heart size. Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise
 within normal limits.  There is a vague but somewhat rounded opacity
 projecting over the left superhilar region seen only on the frontal view.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small vague left suprahilar opacity, for which atelectasis versus
 potentially a small focus of pulmonary infection could be considered in the
 appropriate setting.  Particularly since a pulmonary nodule is not excluded,
 however, short-term follow-up repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs are
 recommended to reassess within eight weeks.  
 
 An email regarding the findings and recommendations was sent to the ED ___
 nursing group on ___ at 2:40 pm.
