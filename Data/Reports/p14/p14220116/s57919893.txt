                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with asthma exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
 No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
