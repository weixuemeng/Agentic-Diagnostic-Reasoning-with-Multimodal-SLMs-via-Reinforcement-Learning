                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.  In comparison with
 study of ___, cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Suggestion of some
 asymmetric opacification at the left base.  Although this could merely reflect
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.  Multiple old healed rib fractures are seen on the
 left.  Opacification in the right upper quadrant that most likely is a sequela
 of previous interventional procedure.
