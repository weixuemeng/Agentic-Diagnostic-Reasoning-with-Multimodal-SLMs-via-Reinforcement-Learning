 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, tachypnea  // eval pnas
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lung is well expanded clear.  Extensive opacification of the left

 right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung opacification is concerning for lingular and left lower lobe
 pneumonia, with some element of collapse.  Chest CT would be helpful to
 evaluate extent of consolidation and exclude central obstruction as a cause.
