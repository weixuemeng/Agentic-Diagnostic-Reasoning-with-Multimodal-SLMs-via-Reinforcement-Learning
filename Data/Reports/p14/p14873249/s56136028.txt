                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are relatively low lung volumes without
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Opacification at the left base, most likely
 reflects pleural effusion and underlying volume loss in the left lower lung. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.
