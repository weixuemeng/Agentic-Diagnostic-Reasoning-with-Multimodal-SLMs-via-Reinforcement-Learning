 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:51 AM
  Persistent opacity at the left base at least partially due to atalectasis and
  pleural effusion. Underlying infection cannot be excluded. Lung volumes are
  low and result in vascular crowding. There is no frank pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute gallstone necrotizing pancreatitis
 with hypertension, shortness of breath and fevers.  // Please evalute for
 fluid overload and cause of fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low.  The
 extent of the known left pleural effusion and the coexisting left basal
 lateral parenchymal opacity, obliterating the left costophrenic sinus, remains
 constant an unchanged. As mentioned in the previous report, this constant
 extent suggests pneumonia or aspiration and should be further evaluated in
 light of the clinical presentation.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly persists. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases. No
 pneumothorax.
