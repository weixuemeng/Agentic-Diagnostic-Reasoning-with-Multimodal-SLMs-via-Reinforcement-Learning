                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and low grade fever  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated which
 could reflect COPD.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Patient is slightly
 rotated to the left on the frontal projection which limits assessment.  There
 is no convincing evidence of pneumonia.  However, subtle wispy opacity in the
 left mid lungis indeterminate and may represent atelectasis versus a very
 subtle infectious process.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Imaged
 bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
