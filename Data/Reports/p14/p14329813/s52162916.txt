                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 slightly underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  Given this, there may
 be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen; however, a left base retrocardiac consolidation may be difficult to
 entirely exclude.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  Possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Difficult to exclude left base
 retrocardiac consolidation due to patient body habitus, although no large
 focal consolidation is seen.
