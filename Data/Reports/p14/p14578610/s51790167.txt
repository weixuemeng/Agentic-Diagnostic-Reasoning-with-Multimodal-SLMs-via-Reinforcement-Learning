                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Retrocardiac
 lucency suggests a hiatal hernia, also seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
