                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness after recent spinal surgery.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Possibly there are trace pleural effusions
 bilaterally.  The lungs appear clear.  Mild rightward convex curvature is
 noted along the thoracic spine.  The bones are probably demineralized.  An
 anterior flowing syndesmophyte is present throughout the visualized thoracic
 spine suggesting idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusions; no evidence of pneumonia.
