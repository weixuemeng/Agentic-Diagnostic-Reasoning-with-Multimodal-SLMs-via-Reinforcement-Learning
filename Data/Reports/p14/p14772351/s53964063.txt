                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fatigue and lightheadedness.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Again low lung volumes are seen.  The lungs, however, are
 clear of consolidation.  There is no effusion.  Increased opacity projecting
 over left upper lung is compatible with asymmetric degenerative changes at the
 costochondral junction of the first rib which is more clearly delineated on
 prior exam secondary to different technique.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
