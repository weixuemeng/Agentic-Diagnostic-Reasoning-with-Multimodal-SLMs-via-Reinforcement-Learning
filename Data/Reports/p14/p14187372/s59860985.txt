 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with residual minimal
 interstitial edema remaining.  Associated decrease in bilateral pleural
 effusions with residual small pleural effusions remaining, and adjacent
 improving atelectasis at both lung bases.  A linear artifact is present in the
 periphery of the left mid lung and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax.
