                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post central venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the lower superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A mild interstitial
 abnormality appears slightly more prominent, suggesting mild fluid overload. 
 Bilateral nephrostomy tubes are partly visualized.  There is similar mild
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of right internal jugular central venous
 catheter; no evidence for pneumothorax.
