                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with sternal and rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph as well as CT abdomen obtained the
 same day and CT torso obtained on ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study, the lateral radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 area of sclerosis in the previously seen sternal fracture, most likely
 consistent with a healing process.  In contrary, the known fracture of the
 third left rib, the fourth left rib laterally are redemonstrated, with
 displacement still present and associated apical pleural thickening.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is currently seen.  No focal consolidations
 are demonstrated.
