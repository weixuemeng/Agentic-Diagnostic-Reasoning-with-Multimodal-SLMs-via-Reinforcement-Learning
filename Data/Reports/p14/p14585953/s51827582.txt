                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of CHF. Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema is present in the setting of moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly, which is stable from the previous exam. There is a left-sided
 pleural effusion as well as a retrocardiac opacity overlying the spine better
 seen in the lateral view. No pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema and a left-sided pleural effusion on the setting
 of stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly. A retrocardiac opacity overlying
 the lower thoracic spine may represent pulmonary consolidation versus
 superimposition of bony structures. Correlate with evidence of pneumonia and
 if further assessment is necessary a chest CT should be pursued.
