                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly decreased.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulcus
 posteriorly on the lateral view may suggest the presence of trace pleural
 thickening or pleural effusions.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  There is no central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary
 edema.  Slightly widened mediastinum with unfolding of the thoracic aorta is
 similar.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There are moderate
 calcifications of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Trace, if any, bilateral pleural effusions or pleural thickening.
 3. Stable moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
