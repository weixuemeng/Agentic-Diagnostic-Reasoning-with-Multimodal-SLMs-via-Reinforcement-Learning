                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  ET tube placement, assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Two AP views of the chest were reviewed.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is most likely dilated,
 partially assessed on this AP view.  Lungs are overall clear except for right
 lower lung atelectasis.  Fullness in the right apex is noted, most likely
 represents summation of shadows and may be further assessed on the lordotic
 projection if clinically warranted.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
