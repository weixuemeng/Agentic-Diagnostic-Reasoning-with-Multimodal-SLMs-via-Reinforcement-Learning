  1. Vague opacification within the right upper lobe could represent pneumonia
  in the correct clinical setting. Followup radiographs with apical lordotic
  views in 6 weeks are recommended to document resolution.  Alternatively,
  further evaluation with a nonemergent chest CT could be performed. 2.
  Prominence of the right hilum may indicate underlying lymphadenopathy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Questionable apical lung mass from outside hospital chest x-ray.
 Evaluate for pneumonia or mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pectoral pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Heart is normal size. There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema. The aorta is tortuous .
 
 There is volume loss seen throughout the right hemithorax.  There is a vague
 opacification and within the right upper lobe.  No well defined masses
 visualized. The minor fissure appears to be in normal position. There is

 lung shows minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Vague opacification within the right upper lobe could represent pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting. Apical lordotic views or chest CT
 recommended. 2. Prominence of the right hilum may indicate underlying
 lymphadenopathy.
