                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dobhoff tube placement  // dobhoff
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:56
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Multiple views of the chest, obtained to assess Dobhoff placement.
 
 On view # 2, the radiopaque portion of the Dobhoff tube overlies the expected
 region of the GE junction, with the tip probably overlying the gastric fundus.
 On view # 3, the tube is been advanced.  The radiopaque portion extends beyond
 the inferior edge of the film and is not localized.
 
 Note is made of an ET tube, with tip relatively low lying, approximately ___.3
 -___.2 cm above the carina.  Of note, however, the inferior edge of the
 clavicular heads is is only ___.7 mm above the carina.  A right IJ central line
 is again noted, overlying the right atrium.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle.  Probable subsegmental atelectasis
 at the right lung base.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Successive views obtained to assess Dobhoff tube placement.  On the
 third/final view, the radiopaque portion of the Dobhoff tube extends beyond
 the inferior edge of this film and is not visualized.  The course of the
 visualized portion of the tube is compatible with extension into the stomach.
 
 Films are centered lower than the typical chest x-ray.  Allowing for this, the
 tip of the ET tube lies relatively low, approximately ___-15 mm above the
 carina.  Clinical correlation is requested.  Please see comment above.
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation again noted.
