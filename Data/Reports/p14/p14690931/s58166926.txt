                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated, compatible with COPD.  A vague nodular opacity projects over
 the right lower lung which could represent suprasternal overlying density,
 though a true nodule is not excluded.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominent retrosternal clear space is also noted,
 compatible with COPD.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with tiny nodular opacity in the right lower lung, for which
 non-emergent CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
