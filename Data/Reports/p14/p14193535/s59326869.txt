                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with rib fractures  // evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by lordotic positioning.  Low lung volumes are present. 
 This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. 
 Known rib fractures are not clearly visualized on the current radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known rib fractures are not well visualized on the current radiograph.  Low
 lung volumes with patchy retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.
