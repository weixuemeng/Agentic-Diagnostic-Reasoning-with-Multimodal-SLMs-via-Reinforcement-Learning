                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with presyncope.  History of non-small cell lung
 carcinoma.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is a dense right basilar region
 of consolidation which has not significantly changed from prior CT and plain
 film.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  There is no visualized nodule in
 the left mid lung seen on most recent CT scan.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent right basilar region of consolidation compatible with patient's
 known non-small-cell lung carcinoma.  No evidence of superimposed acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
