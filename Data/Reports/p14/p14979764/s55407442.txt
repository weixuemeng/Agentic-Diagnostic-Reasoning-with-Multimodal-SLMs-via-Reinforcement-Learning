                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ARF and COPD.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Status post sternotomy.  Presence of a few surgical clips in the
 left anterior mediastinal structures is suggestive of previous bypass surgery.
 The heart size is not enlarged.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 seen. Normal diameter of thoracic aorta but a few calcium deposits are seen in
 the wall at the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No
 signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax
 grossly unremarkable.  Mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature is noted in the
 thoracic spine with mildly anterior wedge-shaped vertebral body, but no
 conclusive evidence for vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 Comparison can be made with a transferred PA and lateral chest examination
 from___.  The findings are identical.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
