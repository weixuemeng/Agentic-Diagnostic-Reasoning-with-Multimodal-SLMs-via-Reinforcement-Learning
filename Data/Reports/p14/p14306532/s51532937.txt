                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic ovarian cancer involving the hemidiaphragm, now
 with leg swelling, question acute interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  A left chest wall
 Port-A-Cath is seen with its catheter extending to the region of the
 cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear increased from prior
 exam though small-to-moderate in size and greater on the right than left. 
 There is associated consolidation in the lower lungs likely atelectasis,
 though I cannot exclude pneumonia.  The mid to upper lungs appear well
 aerated.  The heart and mediastinal contour appears stable.  No free air is
 seen below the right hemidiaphragm.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing bilateral effusions, now small-to-moderate, right
 greater than left with associated atelectasis in the lower lungs, cannot
 exclude pneumonia.
