                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of ovarian cancer with bilateral
 lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for intrathoracic
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded.  There is a bandlike, well defined
 density projecting over the anterior portion of the ___ left rib.  No other
 focal parenchymal opacities are seen.  A linear density projecting across the
 right lower lung is likely a skin fold.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is a
 small right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  A Port-A-Cath port is seen in the left upper hemithorax with
 the tip of the catheter at the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Small right-sided pleural effusion.
 2. No parenchymal opacities concerning for pneumonia.  A well-defined bandlike
 sclerotic density projecting over the left anterior 2nd rib is not clearly
 seen in the lateral view and is of unclear significance. This is felt to
 represent a chest wall or bony abnormality. If available, comparison with
 prior cross sectional imaging could be performed. If not available, then a
 chest CT on a non emergent basis is recommended.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.
