                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 ET tube tip is in the standard position, 3.5 cm above the carina.  There is
 improvement of mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left
 side, are a combination of small effusions and adjacent atelectasis.  Widened
 mediastinum has improved.  Pacemaker lead tip is in the right ventricle. 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Aortic
 stent is again noted.  Left central catheter is seen in unchanged position.
