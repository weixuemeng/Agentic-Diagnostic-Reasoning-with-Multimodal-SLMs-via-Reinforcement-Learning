 AP CHEST, 6:30 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after reintubation.  Check ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 2:45 a.m.:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low, but nevertheless increasing opacification in the
 lungs, more readily seen on the right, is probably due to pulmonary edema. 
 Pathologically widened cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The patient
 has been imaged under another medical record number for evaluation of possible
 mediastinal hematoma, according to Dr. ___.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, upper enteric drainage tube passes at least
 as far as the upper abdomen, but the tip is indistinct.  Transvenous pacer
 lead projects over the apex of an enlarged right ventricle.  Aortic endograft
 extends from the arch to the diaphragm.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion
 small if any.  A conventional chest radiograph is neither sensitive nor
 recommended for detection of chest cage trauma.
