                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing ventilation requirements.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar opacifications are
 consistent with atelectasis, most prominent involving the left lower lobe.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  Probable small left and possibly right pleural effusion.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
