                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after MVC.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is not clearly seen, most likely about 4 cm above the carina. 
 The left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of the subclavian and
 brachiocephalic vein on the left.  Aortic stent is present.  Pacemaker leads
 terminate in the expected location of the right ventricle.  Bibasal
 consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, but there
 is interval improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis.  Note is made
 that this study is limited most likely due to patient's habitus.
