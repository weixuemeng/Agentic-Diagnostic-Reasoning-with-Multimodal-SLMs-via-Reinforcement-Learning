                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary contusions and left rib fracture.  Question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 ET tube in satisfactory position, approximately 5 cm above the carina.  NG
 tube not well visualized, but tip overlies the left upper quadrant.
 Again seen is a left IJ central line, the tip of which overlies the region of
 the aortic arch, and does not cross the midline. 
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for differences in technique, there
 has probably been slight improvement in the CHF findings.  Residual upper zone
 redistribution and mild interstitial edema remains present.  There is
 continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.   Cardiomegaly may be
 slightly improved.  Prosthetic valve and aortic graft again noted.  Pacemaker
 again noted. 
 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures with small left effusion again noted.  No
 pneumothorax detected.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.  Of note, there is an apparent left IJ line
 that does not cross to the right of the mediastinum.
 
 2.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette stable or slightly improved.
 
 3.  CHF findings have improved, but with residual interstitial edema, small
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and small left effusion.  
 
 4. The patient apparently has known pulmonary contusions, but what component
 of the findings is represented by contusion is difficult to distinguish by
 radiograph.
 
 4.  Left-sided rib fractures again noted.  No pneumothorax detected.
