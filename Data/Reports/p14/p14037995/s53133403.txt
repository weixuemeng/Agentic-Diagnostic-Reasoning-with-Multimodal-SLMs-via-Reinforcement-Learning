 AP CHEST, 4:21 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:46 a.m.
 
 Nasogastric tube, most readily seen on second view centered at the diaphragm
 ends in the mid portion of a mildly distended stomach.  Abdomen centered view
 also shows clearing of the lung bases, indicating atelectasis is the major
 problem.  Interstitial pulmonary edema is minimal, improved since earlier in
 the day, but heart is still moderately enlarged and a presumed
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is still present.
 
 Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead tip points upward over the apex of
 the right ventricle, as before.  Right PIC line ends in the mid-to-upper SVC. 
 No pneumothorax.
