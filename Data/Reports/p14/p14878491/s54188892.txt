                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 with some atelectatic changes at the left base.  However, no evidence of
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angle on the left could reflect a small amount of pleural fluid.
