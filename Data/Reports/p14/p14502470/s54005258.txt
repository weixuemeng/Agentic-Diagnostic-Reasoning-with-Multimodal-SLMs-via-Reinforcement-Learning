                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-op day one status post exploratory lap, TAH-BSO for ovarian
 cancer, with decreased O2 sats on room air.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of a chest CT from
 ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  There is slight blurring due to
 motion on the lateral view, but there is suggestion of some more focal
 consolidation in lower lobe posteriorly, with minimal associated pleural
 fluid.  This is suspicious for a left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate. 
 Otherwise, lungs are grossly clear, without CHF or other areas of infiltrate. 
 The heart is not enlarged allowing for technique.  Trace free intraperitoneal
 air seen beneath the right diaphragm is consistent with recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal density in the lower lobe posteriorly is suspicious for a
 lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate, with a small amount of associated fluid --
 Question on the left side.  This finding is new compared with the ___ CT.
