                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia  // evaluate for pneumonia,
 cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Inferior-most sternotomy
 wire appears disrupted.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 demonstrated.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Apart from minimal
 atelectasis in the lung bases, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 trace right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, of unknown chronicity.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with trace right pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
