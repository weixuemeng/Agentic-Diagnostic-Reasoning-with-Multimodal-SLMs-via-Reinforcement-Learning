                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post fall 1 week ago now with continued
 left-sided rib pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs last performed on ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs suggests COPD. Minimal streaky left basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis or aspiration. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax. Blunting the of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly suggests
 a small effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with prominence of the tortuous
 thoracic aorta and mild calcification of the aortic knob.  The hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  There is new deformity of the left lower lateral
 ribs compared to the prior ___ study concerning for nondisplaced or minimally
 displaced rib fractures.  Thoracic kyphosis and degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are redemonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New deformity of the left lower lateral ribs compared to ___ may
 represent nondisplaced or minimally displaced rib fractures in the setting of
 recent trauma. 
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion and left basilar streaky opacity, possibly
 atelectasis or aspiration.
