                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hyperkalemia,
 assessment for lung findings.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Both findings are slightly
 distorted most likely due to low lung volumes.  No definitive distortion of
 the mediastinal contour is noted.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
