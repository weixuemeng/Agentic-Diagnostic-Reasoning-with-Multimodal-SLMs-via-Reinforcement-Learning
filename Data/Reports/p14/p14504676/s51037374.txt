                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size.  Bilateral hilar fullness may represent prominent hilar
 vessels or lymphadenopathy.  Small linear right costophrenic angle opacities
 compatible with scarring or atelectasis.  There is small pleural thickening at
 the left costophrenic angle.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral hilar fullness, which could reflect prominent hilar
 vessels or lymphadenopathy.  Older radiographs should be obtained for
 comparison or, if none available, contrast-enhanced CT should be performed for
 further evaluation.
 
 Findings were entered into the critical results dashboard.
