 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Prostate cancer, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Diffuse generalized bony metastasis with subsequent alteration in the
 radiographic structure of the bones.  At the level of several ribs as well as
 in the region of the right scapula, changes could have minimally progressed.
 
 Lung parenchyma itself is not substantially changed.  There is no evidence of
 acute lung disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal appearance of the mediastinal structures.  Unchanged
 minimal fibrotic changes at the level of the left hilus.
