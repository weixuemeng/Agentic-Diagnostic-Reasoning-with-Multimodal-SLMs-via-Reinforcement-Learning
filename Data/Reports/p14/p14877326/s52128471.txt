 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic ovarian cancer with crackles suspected
 volume overload.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval progression of left lower lobe opacity, highly concerning
 for infectious process.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small. 
 Right lower lobe linear atelectasis is new as well.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in left pleural effusion as well as left basal opacities
 that might reflect interval development of infectious process.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  New right basal
 atelectasis is small.
