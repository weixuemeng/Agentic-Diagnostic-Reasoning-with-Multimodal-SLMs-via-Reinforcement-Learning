                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recurrent ovarian cancer, with crackles and pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior radiograph there is interval development of interstitial
 prominence that might be consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.  Left
 pleural effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis and most likely present small
 right pleural effusion are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of mild interstitial edema.
