 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present, accompanied by new perihilar
 ground-glass opacities, right greater than left, as well as bilateral
 interstitial opacities with a lower lung predominance.  Observed findings
 could represent pulmonary edema in the setting of recent transfusion, but are
 not specific for this process.  Patchy and linear areas of atelectasis are
 also noted.
