                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ovarian cancer.  Evaluate
 nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  The nasogastric
 tube follows the expected course, extending below the diaphragm, although the
 tip is not visualized.  Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal
 silhouettes are within normal limits allowing for lung volumes.  There is mild
 redistribution of blood flow into the upper pulmonary vasculature, suggesting
 pulmonary vascular congestion, without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm, although the tip is
 not visualized.
