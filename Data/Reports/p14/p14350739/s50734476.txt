                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  ICD pacing device is present with additional left ventricular
 pacing lead.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except for very minimal reticular
 opacities at the extreme periphery of the right lung base, new compared to ___ chest radiograph.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific peripheral reticular opacities adjacent to right
 lateral cardiophrenic angle, which could be due to localized atelectasis or
 focal scarring.  If there is strong clinical suspicion for amiodarone lung
 toxicity, consider a high-resolution chest CT for more complete
 characterization.
