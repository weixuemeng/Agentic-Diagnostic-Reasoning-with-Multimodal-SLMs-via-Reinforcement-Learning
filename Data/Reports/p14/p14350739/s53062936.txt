                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with CAD status post CABG, CHF, diabetes type 2,
 NSVT, AFib status post cardiac cath with acute dyspnea.  Study requested to
 assess an explanation for acute dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly remains unchanged.  A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker
 is in adequate position with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion persists with increased
 right basal opacity. There is no definite pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent increased vascular congestion and increased right
 basal opacity. These findings are likely related to increased pulmonary venous
 pressure.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, right basal opacity
 could also represent early developing pneumonia.
