                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Back pain radiating to the chest.  Evaluate for aortic
 dissection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature. 
 Bilateral hazy opacifications of the bases, greater on the left that the
 right, are like atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There
 is no widening of the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral basilar opacification is likely due to atelectasis.
 2.  Normal mediastinal contour.
