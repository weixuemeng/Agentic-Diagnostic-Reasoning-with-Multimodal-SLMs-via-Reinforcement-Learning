                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asthma-like symptoms, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lungs is slightly limited due to
 underpenetration.  Within this limitation, no focal consolidation concerning
 for pneumonia is detected.  A small oblique opacity in the right mid lung
 field on the frontal view may represent an area of mucus plugging versus
 scarring/atelectasis.  Streaky opacities in the bilateral bases are most
 compatible with atelectasis.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Possible mucoid impaction in the right mid to lower lung zone versus minor
 atelectasis or focal scarring.
