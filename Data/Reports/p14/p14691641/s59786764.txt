                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // worsening findings?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 00:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an ET tube ending 4.2 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is seen extending below the diaphragm and out of view.
 Lung volumes are slightly improved from prior.  Increased bilateral alveolar
 opacities.  Retrocardiac consolidation appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube and NG tube in expected position.
 
 2. Worsening bilateral alveolar opacities could reflect worsening pulmonary
 edema, multifocal pneumonia or ARDS.
 3. Retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchograms could reflect atelectasis
 or pneumonia
