                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD s/p CABG, presenting with acute
 hypoxemic failure  // evaluate for infiltrate and edema      evaluate for
 infiltrate and edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  This most likely represents
 severe pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical setting widespread
 pneumonia or even ARDS could be considered.
 Again there are bilateral pleural effusions with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
