 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:05 AM
  The film is very underpenetrated limiting the evaluation.  Stent is seen in
  the region of the SVC.  There is significant elevation of the right
  hemidiaphragm at least in part accounted for by subdiaphragmatic pleural
  effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is known right upper lobe mass and
  adjacent satellite nodules.  If there is continued concern for stenting
  complication a CT of the chest should be obtained.
