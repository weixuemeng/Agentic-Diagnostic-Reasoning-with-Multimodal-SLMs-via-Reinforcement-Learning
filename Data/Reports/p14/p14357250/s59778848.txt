 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Right lower lobe
 consolidative opacity is concerning for pneumonia. A small to moderate size
 right pleural effusion is also demonstrated. Patchy opacity in the left lung
 base could reflect an additional area of pneumonia or atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax is identified. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
