 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with left subclavian attempt.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 11:59 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There is a large left-sided
 pneumothorax with atelectasis of the left lung and mediastinal shift to the
 right.  Endotracheal tube still remains low with tip approximately 1.3 cm from
 the carina.  The enteric tube is seen with tip in the region of the gastric
 fundus, side port not visualized, but potentially in the lower esophagus. 
 Increased opacity in the right lung is likely due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pneumothorax with mediastinal shift.  Endotracheal
 tube still low.  Dr. ___ was aware of findings at time of dictation as he
