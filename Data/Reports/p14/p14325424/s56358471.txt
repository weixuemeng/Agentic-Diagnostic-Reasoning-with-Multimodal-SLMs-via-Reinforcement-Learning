  the left lung and decrease in size of the left pneumothorax.
  
  2. Endotracheal tube remains low lying, at the level of the carina and needs
  to be withdrawn.  Side port of enteric tube appears to be within the distal
  esophagus and should be advanced.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Left pneumothorax status post pigtail placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:53.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with of the tip of the
 pigtail catheter overlying the left mid lung peripherally.  Lucency within the
 left lung base likely reflects residual pneumothorax, though there has been
 interval re-expansion of the left lung.  Ill-defined opacities are noted
 within the left lung base as well as within the right perihilar region.  No
 large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Endotracheal tube is low lying,
 terminating at the level of carina.  Enteric tube tip is within stomach,
 aklthough the side port is likely within the distal esophagus, and can be
 advanced.  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates at the
 junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the left lateral
 chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval placement of left pigtail chest tube with interval re-expansion of
 the left lung and decrease in size of the left pneumothorax.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube remains low lying, at the level of the carina and needs
 to be withdrawn.  Side port of enteric tube appears to be within the distal
 esophagus and should be advanced.
 
 3. Right perihilar and left basilar opacities may reflect pulmonary edema.
