                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a small left
 pneumothorax which appears unchanged.  Small basilar component is newly
 appreciated, however.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving atelectasis
 in the left lower lobe, and slight improvement in heterogeneous opacities in
 the right mid and lower lung regions.
