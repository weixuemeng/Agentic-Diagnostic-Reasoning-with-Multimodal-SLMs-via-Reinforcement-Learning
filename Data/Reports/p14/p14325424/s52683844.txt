                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with
 tip at the level of the carina and should be withdrawn several centimeters for
 optimal positioning.  Enteric tube is seen to the level of the GE junction,
 but not clearly passing off the inferior field of view, although this region
 is not well seen secondary to technique.  Given slight respiratory motion, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen in the thoracic aorta. 
 Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders.  No definite acute osseous
 abnormality visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip at the carina and should be withdrawn
 several centimeters.  Enteric tube seen to the region of the GE junction
 potentially, but not definitely passing off the inferior field of view.  This
 can be followed in subsequent exam.
