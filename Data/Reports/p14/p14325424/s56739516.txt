                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A frontal chest radiograph again demonstrate an endotracheal tube, nasogastric
 tube, right PICC, and left chest pigtail which are unchanged in position. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema is likely unchanged, but not
 fully imaged.  Increasing opacity of the right lung likely represents a
 moderate right effusion and focal consolidation of the right mid lung
 concerning for pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumothorax, with unchanged subcutaneous emphysema. 
 
 2.  Worsening right lung opacification, likely a combination of a moderate
 right pleural effusion and a right mid lung pneumonia. 
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
