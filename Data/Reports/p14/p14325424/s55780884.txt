                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Questionable delirium and elevated inflammatory markers.  History of
 stroke and peripheral vascular disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is moderate unfolding of the
 aorta, which is also tortuous.  The right upper mediastinal margin appears
 convexed and thickened.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes involve the
 left shoulder, including narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval and moderate
 osteoarthritis involving acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints. 
 Degenerative changes are also suspected on the right side, particularly
 narrowing of the glenohumeral joint, but the area is not completely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute process.  
 
 2.  Widened appearance of the upper mediastinal contour which may in part be
 due to technique.  Particularly since prior radiographs are not available to
 show stability of this appearance, short-term followup chest radiographs with
 standard PA and lateral technique are recommended for further evaluation.
 
  Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:___ pm on ___.
