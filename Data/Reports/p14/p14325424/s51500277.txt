                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Compared to the
 prior examination, there is some increased opacity in the right lower lobe. 
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  Heart size is normal and the hila
 appear unremarkable.  There are aortic calcifications with unfolding of the
 aorta.   There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No chf. Probable
 background hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right lower lobe opacity which could be secondary to
 atelectasis, but pneumonia or aspiration cannot be ruled out.  Attention
 should be paid on followup examinations.
