                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left thoracostomy tube has been removed.  No definite pneumothorax is seen. 
 The lung volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Mild
 vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated.  A small
 left pleural effusion appears slightly increased.
