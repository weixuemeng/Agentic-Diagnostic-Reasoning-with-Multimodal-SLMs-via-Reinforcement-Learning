                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  HCV, status post transplant.  Follow up pleural effusions
 and probably pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Large right pleural effusion is unchanged allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  There is increasing right middle lobe and right
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by the
 pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis has increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion associated with adjacent opacities; these
 opacities could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is worsening of the
 loss of volume in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.
