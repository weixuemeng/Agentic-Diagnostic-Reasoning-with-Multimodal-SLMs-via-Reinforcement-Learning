                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness, fall  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A vague opacity in the left lower lung is slightly more conspicuous compared
 with the prior exam. Opacity previously noted in the right mid lung is less
 conspicuous, likely representing residual scarring in the area of prior
 pneumonia. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Heart size is stable and
 the mediastinal contour is unchanged. No displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased conspicuity of opacity in the left lower lung. While the
 differential includes pneumonia, a nonresolving opacity raises concern for
 neoplasm. Consider nonemergent CT to further assess.
 2.  Minimal scarring in the right mid lung at the site of prior pneumonic
 consolidation.
