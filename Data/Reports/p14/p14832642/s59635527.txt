                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  New onset of confusion and lethargy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A focal opacity in
 the left lower lung remains faintly visible but apparently decreased
 substantially. Patchy right mid lung opacity suggests scarring or atelectasis
 without change. There is no definite pleural effusion but a trace pleural
 effusion on the right is difficult to exclude. The bones are probably
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
