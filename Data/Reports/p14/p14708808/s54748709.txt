                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  DX  HYDRONEPHROSIS  PROC; CYSTO STENT REMOVAL
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 and there is mild tortuosity of the descending aorta. No evidence of acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 There is a nodular opacification on the lateral view in the pre vascular
 region measuring just under 1 cm.  Although this could represent merely a
 granuloma, the possibility of a malignant nodule can certainly not be
 excluded.  All efforts should be made to obtain previous images for
 comparison.  If there has been no change in 2 or more years, this could be
 considered a benign process.  Otherwise, CT would be strongly recommended.
