                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of MVC with steering
 wheel strike and sternal and C-spine tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is an ill-defined nodular opacity at the right lung base measuring
 approximately 7 mm, nonspecific, could relate to nipple shadow, although
 underlying pulmonary nodularity not excluded.  Suggest repeat with nipple
 markers or outpatient chest CT for further evaluation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen, however, please note that this
 is not a dedicated thoracic spine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute intrathoracic injury.
 2.  7-mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base may relate to
 nipple shadow, although underlying pulmonary nodularity cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Recommend repeat with nipple markers for further evaluation.
