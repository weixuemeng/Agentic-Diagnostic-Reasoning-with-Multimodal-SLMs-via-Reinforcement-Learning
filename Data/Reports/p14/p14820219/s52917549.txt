                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic lung
 cancer, fever and cough over the past 3 days.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.  Reference
 made to CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight right
 hilar prominence is seen in the region of the previously seen underlying mass.
 However, CT is better in evaluation for interval change.  Perifissural
 thickening/scarring along the right minor fissure is again seen.  There is
 evidence of fluid tracking along the right major fissure on the lateral view. 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small
 pleural effusion.  The left lung is clear, however, the patient has multiple
 known pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT and CT is more sensitive in the
 evaluation of such.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
