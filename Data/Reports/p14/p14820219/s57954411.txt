                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with question of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased density in the right lower lung, concerning for
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion is present, as seen on recent CT. 
 Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules are better seen on CT.  Lung volumes
 are low, exaggerating pulmonary vasculature, which is mildly prominent.  Heart
 size is top normal but may be exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP
 technique.  Right hilar fullness may correspond to adenopathy or known
 malignancy. Sclerosis of the left 10th rib is unchanged, compatible with
 metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Increased opacity in the right lower lung may correspond to pneumonia.  In
 the setting of right hilar malignancy, post-obstructive process cannot be
 excluded. Small right pleural effusion.
 
 This finding was noted by the clinical team in the emergency department
 dashboard note.  This was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 by telephone at 1:20 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery of this
 finding.  
 
 2. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, better characterized on CT,
 compatible with metastases. Osseous metastasis to the left 10th rib.
