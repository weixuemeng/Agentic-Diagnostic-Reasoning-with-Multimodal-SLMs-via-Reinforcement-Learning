                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination which
 constituted an AP portable view and dated ___.  Heart size is
 unchanged.  Relative prominence of left ventricular contour is noted as
 before.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates can be seen, but previously already identified scattered small
 patchy infiltrates are seen in both upper lung fields.  Whereas the left
 lateral pleural sinus is free, there is blunting on the right side with
 thickening of the pleural structures up to the minor fissure.  On the lateral
 view, there is corresponding mild blunting of the right-sided posterior
 pleural sinus, whereas the left side is free.
 
 Review previous chest examinations including a chest CT of ___
 indicates that the patient has undergone pulmonary embolism.  In addition, on
 the latest preceding portable chest examination, a stent in the left main
 bronchus was noted.  The present routine chest examination does not allow to
 make such detailed diagnosis.
