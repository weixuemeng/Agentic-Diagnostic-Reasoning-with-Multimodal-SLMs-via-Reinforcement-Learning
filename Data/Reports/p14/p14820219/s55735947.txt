                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON STUDIES:  ___ and ___, as well as a CT of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right lower lobe consolidation is probably similar to the recent
 study allowing for differences in lung volumes.  Small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion is also similar.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 Fullness in the right lower mediastinal and hilar regions is unchanged, and
 widespread pulmonary nodules are similar to the recent study as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe pneumonia and adjacent small-to-moderate
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Widespread pulmonary metastases.
