  Subsequent CT better depicts pleural effusion and multifocal opacities which
  may reflect pulmonary metastases and pneumonia as well as bilateral pulmonary
  emboli. These findings were discussed with the primary team as described in
  the CT report

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:54 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with worsening tachypnea and pneumonia.  Evaluate
 for worsening pulmonary edema or progression of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, most evident in the left lung. 
 Small right pleural effusion is larger.  Opacification at the base of the
 right lung could be the residual of edema and atelectasis, but there is a
 heterogeneous quality to it that raises concern for pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  This is confirmed in the right upper lobe on the chest CTA performed
 nearly concurrently.  The small lung nodules seen on that study are barely
 visible on this conventional bedside radiograph.
