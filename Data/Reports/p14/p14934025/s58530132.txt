                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic ureteral transitional cell carcinoma, pleural effusion
 status post thoracentesis, now short of breath.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 7:20 a.m., no definite increase in the left pleural
 effusion.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  Doubt CHF.  Minimal opacity at the right base
 may represent a combination of atelectasis and a small amount of pleural
 fluid, also unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate-sized left effusion and underlying left base collapse and/or
 consolidation is grossly stable.
 2.  No CHF or pneumothorax.
 3.  Faint opacity at right base is stable.  Likely a combination of
 atelectasis and a small amount of pleural fluid.
