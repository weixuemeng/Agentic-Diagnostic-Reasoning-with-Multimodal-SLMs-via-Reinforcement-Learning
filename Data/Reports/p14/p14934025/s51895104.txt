                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Follow up of the patient with stage 4 transitional
 cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ radiograph.
 
 There is a substantial interval increase in left pleural effusion, currently
 large associated with left lower lobe atelectasis.  Right lung is essentially
 clear.  Bleeding at the region of the pleural effusion cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
