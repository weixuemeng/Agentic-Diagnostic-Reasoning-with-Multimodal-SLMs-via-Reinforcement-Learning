                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:58 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Subtotal gastrectomy.  Increasing bilirubin and atrial fibrillation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate at least mild if not moderate pulmonary edema and
 mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal vasculature is engorged.  Right hilus is full
 and may be dilated, or there could be hilar adenopathy or even adjacent
 pneumonia.  Repeat conventional radiographs recommended when feasible.
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
