 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Scarring
 within the lung apices is re- demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
