 Comparison is made with prior study performed 5 hours earlier.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Aeration of
 the lower lobes bilaterally has markedly improved.  There are still small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent mild atelectasis.  Left transvenous
 pacemaker leads are in standard position in the right atrium and right
