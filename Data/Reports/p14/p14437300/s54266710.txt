                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cough. Please let for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There
 is mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Apparent leftward displacement of the trachea may be
 positional. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified.  Apparent leftward
 displacement of the trachea is likely due to patient rotation, but correlation
 with physical exam findings may be helpful to exclude thyroid enlargement if
 warranted clinically.
