                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and new ovarian mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  N.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Depicted only
 on the lateral view is a nodular density projecting anteriorly, a possible
 lung nodule, although more likely an artifact or density due to overlying soft
 tissue or bony structures.  Otherwise, lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Possibility of anterior nodule
 which can be assessed with chest CT if needed clinically.
