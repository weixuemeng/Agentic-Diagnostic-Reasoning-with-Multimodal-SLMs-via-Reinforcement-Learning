                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recent extubation in ICU with ARDS, PNA,
 bilateral effusions.  Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary congestion and
 effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Detailed evaluation of lung apices is somewhat limited by overlying soft
 tissue from the chin.  The patient has been extubated in the interim.  Lung
 volumes remain low.  Mild edema persists, overall similar.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions persist but appear to have slightly improved.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are overall similar.  The right PICC line tip
 projects over the expected region of the cavoatrial junction.  Post surgical
 changes in the left humerus and deformity in the left shoulder are partially
 imaged but overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent mild edema with slight interval decrease in bilateral pleural
 effusions.
