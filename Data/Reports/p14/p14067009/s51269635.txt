                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating approximately 2 cm from the carina, with low placement likely
 related to patient head positioning.  The enteric tube is not well visualized,
 but appears to terminate within the proximal stomach.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged.  Apparent mildly improved aeration of the right lung is
 likely due to minimally improved lung volumes.  No new focal consolidation is
 identified.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There may be mild vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent mildly improved aeration of the right lung is likely due to minimally
 improved lung volumes with unchanged consolidations.  No new focal
 consolidation identified.
