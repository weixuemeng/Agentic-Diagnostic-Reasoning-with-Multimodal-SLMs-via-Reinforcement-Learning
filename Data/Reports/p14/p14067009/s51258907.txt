                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 tube courses into the lower chest, likely below the diaphragm, inferior aspect
 not well seen due to underpenetration.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated.  Left base
 opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 increased as compared to the prior study.
