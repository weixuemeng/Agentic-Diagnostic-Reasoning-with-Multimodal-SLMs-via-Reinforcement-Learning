                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP upright portable view of the chest.  External artifact overlying the
 right chest makes evaluation slight suboptimal.  Lung volumes are relatively
 low.  There is prominence of the bilateral pulmonary vasculature, worrisome
 for pulmonary edema.  More focal areas of patchy opacity in the right lung as
 compared to the left could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection
 or aspiration or not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen although a small pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary
 edema; patchy areas of airspace opacity projecting over the right lung as
 compared to the left could relate to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection
 or aspiration are not excluded.
