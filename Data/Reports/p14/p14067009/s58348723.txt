                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
 recovering from ventilator associated pneumonia with acute mental status
 changes.  // Any new infectious process on CXR to explain mental status
 changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left -sided PICC tip terminates in the low SVC.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal contour is similar.  There is persistent
 enlargement of both hila compatible with enlarged bilateral pulmonary arteries
 suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is continued
 moderate pulmonary edema, unchanged, with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 perhaps slightly larger on the left in the interval.  Ill-defined patchy
 opacities within the upper lobes may reflect coexistent multifocal pneumonia,
 better assessed on the previous CT.  Patchy atelectasis is also noted in the
 lung bases.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Continued moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 slightly larger on the left in the interval.
 2. Patchy opacities in the upper lobes likely reflect coexistent multifocal
 pneumonia, better assessed on the previous CT.
 3. Persistent enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
