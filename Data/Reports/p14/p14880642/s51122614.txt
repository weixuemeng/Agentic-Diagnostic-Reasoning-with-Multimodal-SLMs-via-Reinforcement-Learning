                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left-sided VATS.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a left-sided chest tube seen in situ.  There has been
 interval decrease of the mediastinal size and rightward tracheal deviation,
 suggestive of interval decrease in the size of the patient's para-mediastinal
 hematoma.  As compared to the prior examination, there is now decreased
 opacification of the left mid and lower lung.  A small, left-sided pleural
 effusion is noted.  There has been interval increase in the opacification of
 the right mid and lower lung, suggestive of a consolidation which may
 represent either atelectasis or possible aspiration.  Redemonstrated is the
 patient's known left upper lobe mass.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 overt pulmonary edema.  The heart size is normal.  Incidentally noted is a
 significantly distended stomach.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided chest tube noted to be in place without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  
 
 2.  Interval decrease in size of the patient's likely paramediastinal
 hematoma.  
 
 3.  Increasing prominence of a right middle and right lower lobe
 consolidation, concerning for atelectasis or possible aspiration.
