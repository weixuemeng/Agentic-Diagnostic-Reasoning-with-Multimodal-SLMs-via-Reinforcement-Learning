                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar appearance of left upper lobe mass and central left
 mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  Central left upper lobe opacity
 adjacent to the mediastinum has improved and likely represents resolving
 postoperative atelectasis.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect patchy
 atelectasis, aspiration and less likely infectious pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.  Mild elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
