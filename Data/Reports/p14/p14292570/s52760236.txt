 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a right-sided PICC.  There is blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggesting a small pleural effusion with atelectasis. 
 There is also persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung
 is clear aside from possible minimal atelectasis at the left costophrenic
 angle.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 Surgical clip is seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion decreased from the prior study. 
 Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
