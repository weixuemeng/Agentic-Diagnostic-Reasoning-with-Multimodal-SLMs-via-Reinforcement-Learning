                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Perforation after ERCP, now tachypneic, to assess for free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, allowing for
 differences in position, there is little overall change.  Although no definite
 free intraperitoneal gas is seen, this is not an upright view.  To exclude
 free intraperitoneal gas, CT would be necessary.
