                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT scan of the torso
 from ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, on chemotherapy, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The posterior opacity in the lateral view likely reflects the
 presence of a large fat-containing Bochdalek hernia.  There are linear
 densities in the lower lungs, most likely attributable to atelectasis.  There
 is no convincing sign of pneumonia.  No signs of CHF.  The heart size is
 within normal limits.  The aorta is unfolded.  The Port-A-Cath resides over
 the right chest wall with its tip in the low SVC region.  The bony structures
 appear intact.  There is a metallic stent in the region of the aorta as well
 as the common bile duct.
