                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs remain
 hyperinflated. Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly is again noted,
 which may reflect pleural thickening versus small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Bibasilar atelectasis is likely present.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly appears chronic, and may
 reflect pleural thickening or small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.
