  Interval blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests small right pleural
  effusion increased opacification of the bilateral bases most likely reflect
  worsening atelectasis.  Otherwise, similar appearance of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV lung cancer, lymphangitic spread, worsening shortness of
 breath.  Evaluation for spontaneous pneumothorax or worsening effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is interval blunting
 of the right costophrenic sinus, suggesting a newly appeared small right
 pleural effusion with increased atelectasis at the lung bases.  Otherwise,
 there is no relevant change.  The known lymphangitic spread and the known lung
 cancer on the right show similar appearance.  Unchanged overall size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
