                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with
 relative attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is
 compatible with emphysema.  Rounded ill-defined opacity within the periphery
 of the right upper lobe measuring up to 3.9 cm may reflect the patient's known
 malignancy.  Patchy ill-defined opacification within the right lung,
 particularly of the right lung base, could reflect infection.  Scattered
 calcified granulomas are noted in the periphery of the left lower lobe.  Hilar
 contours are otherwise relatively unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild
 right apical and lateral pleural thickening or fluid is noted.  No left-sided
 pleural effusion is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy ill-defined opacity within the right lung, more so in the right lung
 base, could reflect infection.  Rounded opacity within the periphery of the
 right upper lobe may reflect the patient's known malignancy, and comparison
 with recent previous imaging is recommended.  Right apical and lateral pleural
 thickening or fluid.
