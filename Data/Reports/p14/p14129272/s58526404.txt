                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Lobular
 thickening along pleural surfaces in the right lung, particularly along the
 right upper lung suggests malignancy and is more extensive.  There is probably
 a small pleural effusion on the right.  There is a new small-to-moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion with patchy basilar opacity, probably due to
 atelectasis.  Lung fissures are thickened.  The interstitium throughout the
 right lung is also prominent suggesting fluid overload, lymphatic congestion,
 or possibly carcinomatosis.  A medial right basilar opacity appears more dense
 and confluent than on prior studies, although not clearly more extensive.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting progression of malignancy with increased
 pleural thickening in the right lung.  Increased medial right basilar opacity,
 which may reflect a malignant process with atelectasis, but pneumonia is a
 consideration.  New left-sided pleural effusion, small to moderate.
