                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with malpositioned picc.  Evaluate PICC position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right PICC has been repositioned, with tip now projecting at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The endotracheal tube terminates 5 mm above the carina. 
 The nasogastric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and terminates in
 the stomach.
 
 Compared with the prior study, lung volumes remain low with small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.  There is associated bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The heart is top-normal in size.  Sternal wires are intact.  No
 new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval repositioning of the right PICC, with tip now projecting at the
 cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions.
