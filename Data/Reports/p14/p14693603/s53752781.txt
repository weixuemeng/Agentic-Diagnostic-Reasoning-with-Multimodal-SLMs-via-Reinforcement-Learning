 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Verification of central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has two new
 central venous access lines.  One of the lines is a double-lumen catheter
 inserted over the left internal jugular vein.  The tip of the catheter
 projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium.  There is no left
 pneumothorax.  On the right, projecting over the vena cava, a second catheter
 is depicted.  Its tip cannot be exactly visualized as it projects over the
 very dense spine.  Its course, however, is unremarkable.
 
 Atelectasis at the right lung bases, but no evidence of right pneumothorax.
