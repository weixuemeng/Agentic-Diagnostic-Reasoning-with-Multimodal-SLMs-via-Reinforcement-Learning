                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Neuroendocrine cancer, status post perforation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The dialysis catheter placed over the left
 side is in constant position.  The pleural effusion on the right has slightly
 increased, on the left, a minimal pleural effusion has become visually
 apparent.
 
 As a consequence of the effusions, areas of basal atelectasis are seen, right
 more than left.  However, there is no evidence of pneumonia.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
