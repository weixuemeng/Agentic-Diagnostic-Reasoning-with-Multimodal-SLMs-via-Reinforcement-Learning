                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sickle cell disease, vasoocclusive crisis  //
 eval for e/o acute chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy, possibly calcified, opacity projecting over the left mid hemi thorax
 may relate to pleural calcification versus pneumonia.  No prior available for
 comparison.  Chest CT would further assess.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Increased sclerosis at the bilateral humeral heads, not well
 assessed, but concerning for osteonecrosis/bone infarcts.  Some H-shaped
 vertebra are seen, related to sickle cell.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy, possibly calcified opacity projecting over the left mid hemi thorax
 may be pleural in origin and possibly pleural calcification versus pneumonia. 
 Chest CT would further assess.
 
 Sclerosis at the partially imaged humeral heads raise concern for underlying
 bone infarct/osteonecrosis.
