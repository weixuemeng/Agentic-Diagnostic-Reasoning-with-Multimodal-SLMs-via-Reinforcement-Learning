                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, crackles  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___, and CT
 of the torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Again
 seen is markedly asymmetrical elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with loops
 of gas-filled bowel beneath the right hemidiaphragm. Opacity of the right
 hemithorax is consistent with collapse of the right middle lobe and right
 lower lobe seen on CT of the torso performed after this study.  The heart is
 enlarged.  Pacemaker device is present, with leads ending in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. 
 These findings are better assessed on CT of the torso performed after this
 study.
