 FINDINGS: 
 
 This study was made available for my interpretation today, ___, at
 10:55 AM. There are relatively low lung volumes. There is persistent elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm. Overlying right lung opacity could relate to
 atelectasis however, infection/ pneumonia or aspiration is not excluded. The
 left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. Aortic Coral valve is
 again noted. Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, with leads
 extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
