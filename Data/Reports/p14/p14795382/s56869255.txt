                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna, hypoxemia, intubated  // eval ETT
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, the patient has been intubated, with
 tip of endotracheal tube terminating 3.3 cm above the carina.  Right hemi
 thorax has become completely opacified since the recent study, with associated
 slight rightward ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum, suggesting at the
 primary abnormality is complete collapse of the right lung, probably due to a
 central mucus plugs.  A known coexisting pleural effusion is difficult to
 quantify.  Within the left lung, a new heterogeneous opacity in the left lower
 lobe could potentially be due to acute aspiration given its rapid development.
