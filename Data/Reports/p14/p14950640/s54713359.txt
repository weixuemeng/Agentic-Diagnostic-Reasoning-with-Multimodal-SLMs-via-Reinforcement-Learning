                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with HCV cirrhosis and
 metastatic HCC with encephalopathy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is slight additional progression of the widening of the mediastinum at
 the level of the azygos vein that potentially might reflect metastatic deposit
 in this location.  Pleural effusion on the right appears to be increased since
 the prior study.  Left retrocardiac opacity is minimal, most likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although small focus of infection cannot be excluded.  Rest of
 the lungs are clear.
 
 Additional progression of the lymphadenopathy at the aortopulmonic level is
 noted as compared to the prior study that can be also appreciated on the
 lateral view.
