                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness-of-breath and weight gain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is at least moderately enlarged.  Assessment of the cardiac size
 however is difficult to discern exactly due to the presence of small to
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  There is moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine with loss of height of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction which is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate congestive heart failure with small to moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, and bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis.
