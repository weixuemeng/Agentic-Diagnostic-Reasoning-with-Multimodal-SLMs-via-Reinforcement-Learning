                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD 2 CABG  // CT removal PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, multiple lines and tubes, including chest
 tubes, have been removed.  A right IJ central line remains visible, tip over
 distal most SVC.  Equivocal tiny pneumothorax at the right lung apex--___,
 this could be artifact due to ___ effect between the 2 ribs.  Doubt left
 apical pneumothorax.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent,
 but not significantly changed.  There is upper zone redistribution, likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes, without other evidence of CHF.  There is
 continued retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, and a small left effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 also noted.  Extreme right costophrenic angle is obscured by the EKG lead.  No
 gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of lines and tubes.  Possibility of a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis is more pronounced than on the prior study.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small effusion are again
 seen, similar to the prior study.  The amount of left pleural fluid could be
 very slightly greater.
