                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prolonged cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs,
 which raises the possibility of some underlying chronic pulmonary disease. 
 However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
