                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and a CTA chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for acute abnormality in the
 chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  As seen on prior
 CT, patient is known to have interstitial fibrosis with subpleural fibrosis
 likely accounting for the increased reticular opacities seen peripherally on
 the chest radiograph.  There is atelectasis versus scarring at the left lung
 base which appears stable from prior exam.  There is no definite sign of a
 superimposed pneumonia.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinum appears stable.  Bony structures appear intact.  Relative
 deformity of the right distal clavicle likely reflects an old injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarsened subpleural markings c/w known interstitial lung disease
 with scarring versus atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  No signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.
