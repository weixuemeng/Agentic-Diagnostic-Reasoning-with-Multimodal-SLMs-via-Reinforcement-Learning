                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and altered mental status. Evaluate for infiltrate or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 06:09.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been development of bilateral, patchy parenchymal opacities, over
 the past 3 hr. Additionally, there is been slight enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and prominence of the central vasculature. These findings are
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 There is a thin, curvilinear lucency seen under the right hemidiaphragm,
 probably unchanged from 3 hr prior.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New, moderate pulmonary edema from 3 hr prior.
 2. Thin, curvilinear lucency seen under the right hemidiaphragm is consistent
 with free air from peritoneal dialysis.
