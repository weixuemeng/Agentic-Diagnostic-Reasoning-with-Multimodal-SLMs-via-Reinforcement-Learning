                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with cephalization, as well as
 development of small bilateral pleural effusions, new in the interval.  Right
 basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to
 exclude.  Left basilar atelectasis is also likely present.  No pneumothorax is
 identified and there are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude.
