                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with temporal arteritis on prednisone presenting
 with worsening cough and increased sputum production  // Pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated with coarsened lung markings, consistent with
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/pulmonary emphysema.  Previously seen
 nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung is less conspicuous on the
 current study as compared to the prior and may have represented a nipple
 shadow.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the
 descending aorta quite tortuous.  .  Left base atelectasis/scarring is re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
