                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with small PTX s/p fall from kneeling position 
 // Pneumothorax stable?      Pneumothorax stable?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in
 the degree of small right apical pneumothorax.  Continued hyperexpansion of
 the lungs with no evidence of cardiomegaly or vascular congestion.  Continued
 increased opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle, which could merely reflect small effusion and atelectatic changes,
 though the possibility of superimposed consolidation would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
