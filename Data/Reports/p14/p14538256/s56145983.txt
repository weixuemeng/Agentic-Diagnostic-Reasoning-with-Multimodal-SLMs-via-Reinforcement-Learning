                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pneumothorax seen at outside hospital
 institution
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax is
 unchanged. There is no shift of mediastinal structures.   As seen previously,
 patchy ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe is re- demonstrated,
 potentially reflective of pneumonia.  Right lung is clear.  Minimal blunting
 of the costophrenic sulcus on the right suggests a trace pleural effusion. 
 Fracture of the right eighth lateral rib is re- demonstrated with associated
 pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Mild right pleural thickening and pleural effusion with right eighth rib
 fracture, as seen previously.
 3. Unchanged left lower lobe patchy opacity concerning for pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.  Follow up radiographs after treatment are
 recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
