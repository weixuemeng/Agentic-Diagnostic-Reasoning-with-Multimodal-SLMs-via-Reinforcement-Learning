                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and vomiting  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is
 similar blunting of the right costophrenic angle which again may reflect a
 small pleural effusion or pleural thickening. Emphysematous changes are again
 seen within the lung apices. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Minimal patchy opacity is noted within the
 peripheral aspect of the right mid lung field which could reflect a developing
 area of infection. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity within the periphery of the right mid lung field could reflect
 an area of developing infection. Similar blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle, which could be suggestive of a small pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
