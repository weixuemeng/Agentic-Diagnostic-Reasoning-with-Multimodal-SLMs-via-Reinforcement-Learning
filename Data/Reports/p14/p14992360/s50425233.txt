                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right greater than left lower lobe crackles and cough.  Evaluate for
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  A linear opacity in the left mid lung is probably
 scarring from prior pneumonia demonstrated in this region.  Parenchymal
 distortion and apical bullous changes are consistent with underlying
 emphysema. Bilateral pleural thickening is redemonstrated, most pronounced at
 the apices and right upper hemithorax laterally. No new areas of parenchymal
 consolidation are noted.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present with wires terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle. Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
