                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, new aspiration event,
 possible apical pneumothorax on prior chest film.  Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___, at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Left-sided pacer is again seen with three leads terminating over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is diffuse air space
 process with more focal consolidation again seen in the left mid lung and at
 the lung bases.  This is concerning for bilateral pneumonia/aspiration.  In
 addition, the lungs remain hyperinflated and there is parenchymal distortion
 and apical bullous changes consistent with underlying emphysema.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles which may
 represent chronic pleural thickening or small effusions.  Heart remains
 enlarged most likely representing cardiomegaly.  In addition, the perihilar
 vasculature is somewhat more prominent and indistinct which suggests a
 component of superimposed perihilar edema.
