 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p fall unwitnessed  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung apices are excluded on the
 frontal view limiting assessment.  Left chest wall pacemaker is again seen
 with intact appearance of 3 leads - 1 extending to the region of the right
 atrium and 2 extending to the region of the right ventricle, unchanged in
 position. Cardiomegaly is mild and stable. The aorta is mildly unfolded.
 Mildly increased prominence of the interstitial markings with minimal hilar
 engorgement raises potential concern for mild congestion/edema.  No convincing
 signs of pneumonia. A nodular opacity in the left mid lung is stable from ___ radiograph. Right upper lobe scarring is also stable. No bony
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
