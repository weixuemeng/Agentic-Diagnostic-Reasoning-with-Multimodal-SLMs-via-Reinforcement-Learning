                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increase in the left
 upper lobe consolidation accompanied by increased prominence of pulmonary
 vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  There is a
 possible small pleural line that could be reflection of a small apical
 pneumothorax on the right, there is suggestion of a vessel running beyond this
 line in the far apical region, raising the possibility that this could
 represent merely a skinfold.
