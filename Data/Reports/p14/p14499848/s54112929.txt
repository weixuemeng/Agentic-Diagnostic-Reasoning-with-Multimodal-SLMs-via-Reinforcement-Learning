                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Lung markings are coarse with irregular
 architecture, suggestive of underlying lung disease.  This appearance could be
 seen with obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease or a
 mixture of both.  The prominence of the interstitium makes it difficult to
 exclude more acute etiologies, however, such as mild vascular congestion,
 airway inflammation or atypical infection.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  Diaphragms are flattened, however, so subpulmonic effusions are not
 excluded, although the finding may relate to hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarse irregular lung architecture suggesting underlying lung
 disease.  No definite superimposed process, but vascular congestion, airway
 inflammation or atypical infection may be involved with this appearance.
