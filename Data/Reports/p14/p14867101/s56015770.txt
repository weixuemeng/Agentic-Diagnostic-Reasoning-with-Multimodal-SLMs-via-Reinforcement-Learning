 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low resulting in prominence and crowding of
 the vascular markings.  There is atelectasis in the right upper lobe and
 probable underlying scarring. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema,
 or pneumothorax.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Low lung volumes with associated crowding of the vascular markings.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
