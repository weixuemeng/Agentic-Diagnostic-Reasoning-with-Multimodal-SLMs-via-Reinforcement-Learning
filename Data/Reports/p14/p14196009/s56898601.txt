                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver failure, change in mental status, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable and stable.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Moderate size right pleural effusion is increased compared to the
 prior exam.  There is associated right lower lobe opacity which likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  Left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion, increased compared to the previous exam.
 Right lower lobe opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis but infection
 cannot be excluded.
