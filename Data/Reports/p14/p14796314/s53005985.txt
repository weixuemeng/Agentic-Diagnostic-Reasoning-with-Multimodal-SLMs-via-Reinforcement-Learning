                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:22 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  New Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Feeding tube, wire stylet in place, passes into the upper abdomen.  Course of
 a previous nasogastric drainage tube showed that the gastroesophageal junction
 is nearly midline which would explain the course of the feeding tube, in what
 I suspect is a gastric neoesophagus.
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved, in the left lung, not on the
 right, where moderate right pleural effusion has increased.  Heart size is
 normal.  Left internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
