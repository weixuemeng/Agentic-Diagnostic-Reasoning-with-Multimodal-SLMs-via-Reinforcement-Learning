                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased bilateral
 opacifications most consistent with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 More localized opacification at the left base with pleural effusion is
 worrisome for possible supervening pneumonia.
