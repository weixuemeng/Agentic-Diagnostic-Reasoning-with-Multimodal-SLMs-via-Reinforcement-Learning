 nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The pre-existing right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.

 cardiomegaly and minimal fluid overload, but no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
