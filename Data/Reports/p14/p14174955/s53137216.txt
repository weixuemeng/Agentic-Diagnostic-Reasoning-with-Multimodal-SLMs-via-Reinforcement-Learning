                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia versus VAP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  Mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure persists.
 
 The area of increased opacification at the right base suggested on the
 previous study is somewhat difficult to appreciate due to obliquity of the
 patient.  The hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, suggesting some pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  A lateral view would be most helpful to determine
 whether there is a superimposed pneumonia.
