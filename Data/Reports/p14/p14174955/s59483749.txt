 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with GI bleed and recent self extubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Right IJ line remains in acceptable position, tip in the low SVC. The left IJ
 sheath has been removed.  The patient has been extubated.  Lungs remain well
 aerated, without appreciable effusion, and without pneumothorax or focal
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Evaluation of the hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours is limited by patient rotation, though they appear unchanged.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post extubation.  Grossly clear lungs without acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
