                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, history of heart failure, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is severe cardiomegaly which has progressed since
 prior study.  The azygos vein is distended.  There is obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis and effusion. There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. Calcifications of the
 tracheobronchial tree as well as the aortic arch are noted. Visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly which has progressed since prior study as well as
 distended azygos vein compatible with heart failure.  The degree of edema and
 likely left effusion is difficult to assess on the supine view.  Upright and
 lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
