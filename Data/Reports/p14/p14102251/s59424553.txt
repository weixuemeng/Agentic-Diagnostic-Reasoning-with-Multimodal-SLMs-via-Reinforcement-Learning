 otherwise clear, without nodules or consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no sign of pneumonia.  Large linear opacity in the right
 lung is for pleural plaque.  Persistent small atelectasis at the right base
