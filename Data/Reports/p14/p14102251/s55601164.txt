                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with coughing.  Evaluate for
 possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No
 configurational abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta of ordinary
 ___ but rather advanced walled calcifications are seen at the level of
 the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the left hemithorax
 demonstrates rather normal findings.  The right lung shows evidence of chronic
 and old fibrotic changes on the right lung base which already on the last
 preceding study of ___ were identified as chronic fibrotic
 changes with parenchymal volume loss in this area.  Findings are completely
 unchanged both as seen on frontal and lateral views, thus there is no evidence
 of any new acute pulmonary infectious process.  Also the normal vascular
 appearance in the left hemithorax excludes CHF as the cause of the patient's
 coughing.
