                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.  Comparison is made to a scout
 image of the lower chest from a prior CT abdomen study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina, and
 the cuff of the tube is slightly overdistended.  Widening of cardiomediastinal
 contours may reflect a combination of cardiovascular distention as well as
 mediastinal lipomatosis given the presence of a large amount of fat
 surrounding the heart on prior CT abdomen ___.  Bilateral
 perihilar airspace opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than
 the left may reflect pulmonary edema, multifocal aspiration or infectious
 pneumonia.  Probable small right pleural effusion as well as a mild elevation
 of adjacent right hemidiaphragm.  No visible pneumothorax.
