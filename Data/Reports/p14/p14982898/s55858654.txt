                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with severe left MCA stroke with newly placed NG tube. 
 Please evaluate for NG tubes position as well as pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 a new nasogastric tube.  Although it is difficult to definitively determine
 tip of the nasogastric tube, the tube appears to have gone into the stomach
 and turned back around itself with tip likely in the mid esophagus. 
 Otherwise, unchanged exam with stable cardiomediastinal borders.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged
 compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube has passed below the diaphragm, hit stomach wall
 and returned back up the esophagus.  Recommend withdrawal of approximately 17
 cm or consider repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance.  Otherwise,
 unchanged exam.
