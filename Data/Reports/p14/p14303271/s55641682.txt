                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild prominence of the hila is noted. There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Diffuse increased interstitial markings likely reflects
 moderate pulmonary edema. Slightly more confluent opacities, especially in the
 right mid and lower lung are noted, which may represent a developing
 infectious process. Gaseous distention of small bowel loops in the upper
 abdomen is noted. Irregularity of the right anterolateral second rib may
 reflect prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Normal heart size but prominent hila and interstitial markings with small
 bilateral pleural effusions, likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema. More
 confluent opacities in the right mid and lower lung may represent a
 superimposed infectious process.
