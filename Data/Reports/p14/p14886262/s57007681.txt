 left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  Mitral anulus calcification is likely present.  Degenerative
 changes are seen along the spine and at the partially imaged shoulder joints.
