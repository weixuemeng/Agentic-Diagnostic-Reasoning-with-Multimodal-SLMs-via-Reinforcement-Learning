                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Questionable history of positive PPD.  Evaluate for evidence of
 tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a heart which is normal in
 size and well aerated lungs which are clear.  A small opacity lying anterior
 to the heart on lateral view probably corresponds with slight opacity at the
 apex on frontal view, likely representing a prominent fat pad.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of active or latent tuberculosis.
