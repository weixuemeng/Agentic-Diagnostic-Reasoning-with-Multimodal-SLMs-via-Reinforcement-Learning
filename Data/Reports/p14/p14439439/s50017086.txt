                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Renal failure, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right
 mid-to-lower lower lung opacity seen on the frontal view is not substantiated
 on the lateral view and may be due to atelectasis or possibly vascular
 engorgement, consolidation is felt less likely.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild prominence of the hila which may be due
 to central pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There appeared to be some posterolateral right-sided rib
 deformities which may be due to prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity without priors for comparison may be
 due to atelectasis or vascular engorgement, consolidation felt less likely. 
 Mild prominence of the hila may be due to central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement with mild vascular congestion.
