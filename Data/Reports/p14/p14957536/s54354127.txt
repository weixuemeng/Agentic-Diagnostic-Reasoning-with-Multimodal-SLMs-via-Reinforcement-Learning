                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // ? pna       review of PACs
 indicates a history prior asbestos exposure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. There is background COPD. There are
 bilateral calcified pleural plaques, weight can obscure underlying pulmonary
 parenchyma.  There is mild cardiomegaly, with a calcified unfolded aorta,
 likely unchanged, allowing for technical differences. Prominence of the hila,
 with a tapered appearance, is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, unchanged.
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 There is new patchy opacity at the left base. Minimal opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region is not clearly changed. No gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region, which could represent an
 early infectious infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
 2. Calcified pleural plaques and other chronic parenchymal changes, again
 noted.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution, and hilar prominence
 suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, unchanged.
