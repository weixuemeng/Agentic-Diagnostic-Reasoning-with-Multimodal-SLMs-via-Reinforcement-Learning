                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and subjective fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours appear
 within normal limits.  There are patchy bilateral perihilar opacities, more
 extensive on the left than right, including bronchovascular opacity in the
 left lower lobe, which is best depicted on the lateral view.  Central airways
 appear cuffed.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia.  Given the predominance of
 streaky perihilar opacification, in addition to typical bronchopneumonia,
 atypical infection could also be considered as a potential etiology.
