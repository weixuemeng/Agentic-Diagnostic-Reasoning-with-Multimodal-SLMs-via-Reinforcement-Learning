 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower, causing crowding
 of bronchovascular structures.  However, increased interstitial pulmonary lung
 markings bilaterally suggests mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 focal consolidation or pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is unchanged.  Compression wedge deformities of 2 thoracic spinal
 vertebral bodies are unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation
 identified.
 
 2.  Compression wedge deformities of 2 thoracic spinal vertebral bodies are
