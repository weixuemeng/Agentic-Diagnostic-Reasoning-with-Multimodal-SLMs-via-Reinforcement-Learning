                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with L flank pain  // rib fx or infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volume is low.  Mild bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 although pneumonia is not fully excluded at the left base.  Small left pleural
 effusion is noted.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to low lung
 volumes.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.  Compression deformities of
 the spine appear similar to before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evaluation of lung bases is limited due to low lung volumes.  The repeat
 radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to more fully
 evaluate left lower lobe opacities to help distinguish atelectasis from
 infectious pneumonia.
