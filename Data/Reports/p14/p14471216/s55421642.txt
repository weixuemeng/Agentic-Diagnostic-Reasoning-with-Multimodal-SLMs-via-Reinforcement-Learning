                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain decreased.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged, and there is minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small pleural
 effusions are suspected.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar opacification
 may be due to bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes;
 however, a superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical context.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable. 
 The thoracic aorta is unfolded with minimal calcification of the aortic knob. 
 The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and
 minimal interstitial edema.
