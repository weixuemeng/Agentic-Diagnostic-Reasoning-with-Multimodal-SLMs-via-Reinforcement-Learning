                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs appear clear except for minimal streaky density consistent with
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. There is no pneumothorax. The heart
 appears large but cardiac size may be exaggerated by portable technique.  The
 aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Mediastinal structures are otherwise
 unremarkable. There are degenerative changes in the spine.
 
 Surgical clips are projected beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No active pulmonary disease.  Prominent cardiac silhouette.
