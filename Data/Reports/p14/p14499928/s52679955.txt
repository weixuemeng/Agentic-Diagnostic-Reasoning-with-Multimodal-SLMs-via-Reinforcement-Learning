                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-fiducial seed placement under CT, chest x-ray 11:30; to assess
 for pneumothorax.  Rule out right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Left lung asymmetry is related to prior left lower lobe wedge
 resection with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  New fiducial
 marker has been placed at the right lung base.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Air-fluid
 level in the left retrocardiac region is neoesophagus in patient with history
 of esophagectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no sign of pneumothorax after positioning of fiducial
 marker at right lung base.  There is no pleural effusion.
