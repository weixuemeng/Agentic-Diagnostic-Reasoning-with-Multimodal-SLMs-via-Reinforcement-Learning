                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right-sided VATS, right
 lower lobe wedge resection x2, evaluate for interval change.
 
 PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright position are
 analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Heart size remains unchanged and apparently within normal
 limits.  No pulmonary congestion is present.  Thoracic aorta unchanged. 
 Left-sided hemithorax which was already earlier status post VATS procedure
 remains unaltered.  On the right side, marked reduction of the previously
 existing pleural density that resulted in hazy obscuration of the right lung
 base has regressed markedly.  The previously existing chest wall emphysema has
 disappeared.  Right lateral pleural sinus is free, and the posterior pleural
 sinus appears also free from major fluid accumulation as seen on the lateral
 view.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of right-sided pleural densities since next
 preceding study two weeks ago.  Right diaphragmatic contours are now free in
 this patient status post right lower lobe wedge resections x2.
