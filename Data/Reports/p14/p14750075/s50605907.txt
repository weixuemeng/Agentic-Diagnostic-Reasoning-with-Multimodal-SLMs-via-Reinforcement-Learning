                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxic  // evaluate for IPF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest from ___ available on Atrius.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a mildly enlarged heart and
 low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There are diffuse
 coarse interstitial opacities likely reflecting known interstitial lung
 disease, with probable mild superimposed pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity
 in the left lower lobe may reflect patient's known interstitial lung disease
 with atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  There is a possible left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  Compression deformity of an upper lumbar vertebral body is of
 unclear chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse coarse interstitial opacities likely reflective of the patient's known
 interstitial lung disease with superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  More focal
 opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Possible small left pleural
 effusion.
