                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:06 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Intubation after cerebral hemorrhage.  Check ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 2 cm from the carina with the
 chin slightly flexed.  Repositioning is not necessary.  Leftward rotation
 makes it difficult to determine if there is mild leftward mediastinal shift,
 as one would expect with what appears to be mild left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Small left pleural effusion may be present.  There is no pleural effusion on
 the right or focal abnormality in the right lung.  Overall, heart size is
 normal.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  No pneumothorax.  Biapical
 pleural parenchymal irregularity is almost certainly scarring.
