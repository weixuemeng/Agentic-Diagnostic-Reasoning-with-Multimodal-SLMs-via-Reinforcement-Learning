                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Abdominal CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-erect portable AP radiograph of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated and clear.  The right costophrenic sulcus is not imaged.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Tortuosity of the aorta is noted.  There are
 diffusely increased interstitial markings which appear to be chronic and also
 seen on scout image from ___ CT.  Prominent mediastinal contour may
 represent aortic aneurysm.  Correlate with clinical history.  Median
 sternotomy cerclage wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with chronically increased interstitial
 markings, concerning for chronic lung disease.
 2.  Aortic tortuosity and prominent aortic knob is grossly stable.  Correlate
 with history of known thoracic aortic aneursym or prior chest CT imaging. If
 none, findings could be further evaluated on chest ct.
