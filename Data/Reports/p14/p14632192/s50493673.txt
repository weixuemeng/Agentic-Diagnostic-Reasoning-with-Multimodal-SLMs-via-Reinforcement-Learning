 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Superimposed on a large known mass in the right lower lobe
 are new multifocal opacities in both the right upper and lower lobes most
 suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.  The left lung remains clear.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex curvature is
 similar with osteophyte formation along the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.  Large
 underlying mass, suspicious for malignancy, in the right lower lobe.
