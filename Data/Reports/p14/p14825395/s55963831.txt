                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy with new oxygen
 requirement, assess for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  There is increased
 opacification in the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm medially,
 which most likely represents atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 definite pleural effusion.  Pleural surfaces are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification at the left base, which most likely represents
 atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting findings could
 represent a developing consolidation or aspiration.
