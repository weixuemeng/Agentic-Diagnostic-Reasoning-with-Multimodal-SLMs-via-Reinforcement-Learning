                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemothorax diagnosed at an outside hospital.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear without
 a consolidation or edema.  Linear calcifications along the left mid lung zone
 and right base are most consistent with calcified pleural plaques.  There is a
 minimally displaced lateral ninth rib fracture.  The lower ribs are not
 included in the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimally displaced lateral right ninth rib fracture.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion, which in the setting of a rib fracture, may
 represent a hemothorax.
 3.  Calcified pleural plaques, consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
