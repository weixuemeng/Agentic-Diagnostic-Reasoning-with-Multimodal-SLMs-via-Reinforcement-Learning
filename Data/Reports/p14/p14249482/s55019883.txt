                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man, fell, on Coumadin.  Previous pleural effusion or
 hemothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small right pleural effusion is unchanged since ___, when chest CT saw a
 small hemorrhagic pleural effusion.  Lateral view shows some posterior
 loculation of the fluid which could have otherwise been considered strictly
 dependent on the chest CT.  Hyperinflation reflects emphysema.  Linear pleural
 calcifications noted suggest asbestos exposure.  Heart size normal.  Right
 posterior lower rib fracture seen on the chest CT is not evident on this
 examination, but it should be remembered that conventional chest radiographs
 are relatively insensitive for the detection of subtle bone trauma.
