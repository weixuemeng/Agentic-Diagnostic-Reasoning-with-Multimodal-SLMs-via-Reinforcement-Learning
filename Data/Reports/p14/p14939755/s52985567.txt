                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis status post hemothorax with
 chest tube removal and residual pneumothorax.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:30.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:12 a.m. are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The right apical
 pneumothorax on the previous study has significantly decreased in size with
 only a tiny residual at the apex.  Lung volumes remain low with some crowding
 of the perihilar vasculature but there is still a suggestion of pulmonary
 venous hypertension and possibly mild interstitial edema.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
