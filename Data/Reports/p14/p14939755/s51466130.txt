                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis, now with volume
 overload, suspected pulmonary edema.
 
 No prior studies relevant for comparison are available.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Tortuous ascending aorta might
 be consistent with history of aortic stenosis.  There is right lower lung
 consolidation that might reflect a combination of pleural effusion and right
 lower lung infectious process.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
