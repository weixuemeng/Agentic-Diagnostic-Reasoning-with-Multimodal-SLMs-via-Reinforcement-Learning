                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads in
 unchanged grossly appropriate location overlying the right ventricle and right
 atrium, respectively.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable,
 reflecting mild cardiomegaly.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Opacities at the lung bases most likely reflects dependent
 atelectasis.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis.  No focal lung consolidation. 
 Stable mild cardiomegaly.
