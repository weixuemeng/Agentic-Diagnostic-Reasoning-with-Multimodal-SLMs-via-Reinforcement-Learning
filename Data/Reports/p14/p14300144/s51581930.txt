                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, fever and right-sided chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON: Chest radiograph ___. Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and the pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Streaky opacities are seen within the lung bases
 bilaterally, which may reflect atelectasis.  Infection however is not
 excluded. Previously noted pulmonary nodules on CT are not well assessed on
 the current exam. There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection is
 not excluded.
