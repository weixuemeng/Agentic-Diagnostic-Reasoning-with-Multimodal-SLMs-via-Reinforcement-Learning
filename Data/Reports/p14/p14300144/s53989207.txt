                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diabetes with right lower lobe wheezes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no definite change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged and the dual-channel pacemaker device remains in place.  No definite
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 with flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggests some underlying chronic
 pulmonary disease.
