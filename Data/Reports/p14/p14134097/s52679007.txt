                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain status post trauma, interval change, question
 rib fracture right.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  No previous ___ films on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There is borderline cardiomegaly, with somewhat transverse orientation to the
 cardiac silhouette.  There are low inspiratory volumes.  This likely accounts
 for the appearance of upper zone re-distribution.  No focal infiltrate,
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No lucent fracture line or displaced
 rib fracture is detected.  Assessment of the spine is limited on these views
 but raises the question of some disc space narrowing at the thoracolumbar
 junction (T12-L1).
