                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD, diverticulitis, worsening cough and pleuritic pain, right
 upper and middle dullness.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and minimally unfolded.  Possible minimal upper zone redistribution,
 but no other evidence for CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  No effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  No findings to confirm the
 presence of pneumonia.  If the patient has left base symptoms, then followup
 imaging to exclude a developing early infiltrate at the left base could be
 considered.  However, the right lung is clear.
