                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ET tube s/p TAVR complicated  //
 evaluation of volume status      evaluation of volume status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  The tip of the endotracheal tube lies
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.
 There is further enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  However, the there is increased opacification at
 the bases with silhouetting the hemidiaphragms, consistent with bilateral
 pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis.  Some of this change
 could reflect a more supine position of the patient.
