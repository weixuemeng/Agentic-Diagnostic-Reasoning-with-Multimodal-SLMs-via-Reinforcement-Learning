                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening pedal edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is difficult to assess due to the presence of bibasilar
 airspace opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis though aspiration or
 infection are not excluded.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, small on
 the left and moderate on the right, with mild pulmonary edema noted.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is present with mild loss of height
 of several thoracic vertebral bodies, similar compared to the previous exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small to moderate sized bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect compressive atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
