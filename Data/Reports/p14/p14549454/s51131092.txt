                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Amyloidosis lymphoma and shortness of breath and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  There may be a region of
 consolidation in the right middle lobe, responsible for obscuration of the
 right heart border and seen on the lateral view.  Whether it is atelectasis or
 pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate.  Oblique views might be helpful
 in demonstrating to better advantage, but I doubt will be able to distinguish
 between these two possibilities.  The upper lungs are clear.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.
