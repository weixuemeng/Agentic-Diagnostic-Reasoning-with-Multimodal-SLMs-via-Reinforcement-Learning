 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is
 mild upper zone vascular redistribution.  Patchy opacities in lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Clip is noted in the left upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis, though early infection is not completely excluded.
