                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, day two postop.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 New bibasilar opacities are consistent with large areas of atelectasis, larger
 on the right side.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly cannot be
 evaluated given the low lung volumes.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusions.  Of note, the chin of the patient obscures the apices of
 the lungs.
