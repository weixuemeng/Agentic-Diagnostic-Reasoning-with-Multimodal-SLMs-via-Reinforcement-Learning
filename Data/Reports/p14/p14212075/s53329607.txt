                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluation for
 cardiomegaly, pneumothorax, or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, likely
 due to a focal pleural pleural abnormality, extending into the lateral aspect
 of the horizontal fissure.  The heart is top normal in size, and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.  No focal airspace consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal right pleural abnormality along the anterior pleural
 surface, extending into the minor fissure.  Correlation with prior imaging is
 recommended to evaluate for stability as this could represent chronic
 scarring.  If comparison exams are not available, a CT of the chest is
 recommended.
