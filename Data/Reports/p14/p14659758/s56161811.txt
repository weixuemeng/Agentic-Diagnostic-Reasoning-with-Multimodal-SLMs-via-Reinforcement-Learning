 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the ET tube previously in the right main bronchus is still low, less
 than 15 mm from the carina and should be withdrawn 25 mm.  Lung volumes are
 still extremely low and therefore consolidation at the lung bases is
 attributed to atelectasis.  Aspiration however remains a concern.  The upper
 lungs are clear.  The heart is normal size.
 
 Nasogastric drainage tube is coiled in a nondistended stomach.  No
 pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
