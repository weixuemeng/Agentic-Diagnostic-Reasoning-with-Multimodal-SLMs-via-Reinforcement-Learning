                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain.  // US Liver/Gallbladder: r/o
 hepatobiliary pathology US Pelvic/Transvag: r/o ovarian pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Streaky linear opacities at the left base are
 overall unchanged and consistent with atelectasis.  Opacification at the right
 base is probably due to atelectasis as well given the low lung volumes.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis is overall similar to the prior
 examination.
