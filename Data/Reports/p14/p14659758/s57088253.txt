                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // acute intrathoracic process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, in comparison the prior examination dated ___, there has been
 no relevant interval change. Lung volumes remain low. Streaky, linear
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis and are improved. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with improving bibasilar linear opacities most suggestive of
 atelectasis.
