                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MS neurogenic bladder status ___ ileal conduit diversion, one-day
 history of malaise, lethargy, shock, respiratory failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  A right IJ central line
 tip overlies the SVC/RA junction.  There is also a Port-A-Cath type catheter
 present, lead tip over the right atrium.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Cardiomegaly.  There are low inspiratory volumes, with
 evidence for vascular plethora and increased opacity about the right perihilar
 region.  There is also worsening increased retrocardiac density, with air
 bronchograms and interval obscuration of left hemidiaphragm consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse or consolidation. No definite effusion, though small
 effusions would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 2.  Worsening right perihilar opacity.  While this may be accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes, the level of inspiration is similar to the prior film.
 
 3.  Suspect background vascular plethora/CHF, also worse.
