                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  History of multiple sclerosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper right atrium.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Although the left
 costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, there is no evidence for pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Streaky left middle lung opacity,
 probably unchanged, suggests minimal scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
