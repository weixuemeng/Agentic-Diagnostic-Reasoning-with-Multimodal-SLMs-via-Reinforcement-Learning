                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, with acute pancreatitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are bilateral atelectatic streaks, just
 above the hemidiaphragm on the lateral view and involving the right middle
 lobe as well.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles, though no evidence of
 definite effusion on the lateral view.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note is dilatation of loops of bowel in the abdomen, consistent
 with adynamic ileus.
