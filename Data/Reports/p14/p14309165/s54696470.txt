                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall with laceration to head  // r/o acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with an increased AP diameter, which is likely
 exaggerated by the thoracic spine kyphosis.  Heart size is moderately enlarged
 but stable.  There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is likely a function of small
 pleural effusions, better characterized on the CT from the same day.  A
 significantly calcified aortic knob is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 2. Hyperinflated lungs consistent with underlying emphysema.
 3. No evidence of pneumonia.
 4. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 5. Please refer to same-day CT for evaluation of traumatic injury to the
 chest.
