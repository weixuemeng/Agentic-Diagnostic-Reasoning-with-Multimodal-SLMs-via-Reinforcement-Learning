                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is again severely enlarged with globular
 appearance that may suggest some degree of pericardial effusion.  Extent of
 the heart size is difficult to evaluate in the presence of large bilateral
 pleural effusions which are similar in severity compared to prior exam, with
 adjacent bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is increased central
 pulmonary vascular congestion with increased reticulations compatible with
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Calcified right lung nodules indicate prior
 granulomatous disease. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of the chest to ___ exam with
 redemonstration of cardiomegaly with mild globular appearance which may
 suggest a component of pericardial effusion along with large bilateral pleural
 effusions and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Underlying infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical circumstance.
