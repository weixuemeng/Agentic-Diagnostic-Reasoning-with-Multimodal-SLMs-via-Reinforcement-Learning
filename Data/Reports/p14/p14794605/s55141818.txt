                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of falls, left forearm bruise and incoherent speech for 2
 months.  Question fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is unchanged enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary
 edema.  There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities
 are likely compressive atelectasis; however, underlying pneumonia is not
 excluded.  No pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture identified, although
 dedicated rib series or CT are more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Evidence of fluid overload with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No fracture seen, please note dedicated rib series or chest CT are
 more sensitive.
