 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with AFib, hyponatremia, concern for
 CHF.  Evaluate for pneumonia or congestion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 15:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged which most likely reflects cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  There are likely layering
 bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar air-space disease, most likely
 representing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Some calcified lung
 nodules on the right likely reflect prior granulomatous infection.  Compared
 to the previous study, the pleural effusions and bibasilar air-space process
 has developed.  There are degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints. 
 No pneumothorax.
