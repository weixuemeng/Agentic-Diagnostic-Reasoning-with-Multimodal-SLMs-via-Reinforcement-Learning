                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Calcified mediastinal and right hilar lymph
 nodes are re- demonstrated as well as a 6 mm calcification projecting over the
 right lung base which on the prior CT was noted to be pleural based. These
 findings are compatible with prior granulomatous disease. Linear and patchy
 nodular opacities are again noted in the lingula and right middle lobe
 compatible with bronchiectasis and ___ infection. No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The lungs are hyperinflated. No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
