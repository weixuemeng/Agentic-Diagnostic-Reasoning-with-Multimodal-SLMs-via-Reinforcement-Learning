                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of frequent pneumonia probably
 secondary to aspiration, esophageal dysmotility.  Now presenting with fever
 and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and a chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a patchy opacity in the mid left lung field including the
 retrocardiac space that does not obscure the left hear border.  Bilateral
 bibasilar discoid atelectases are also noted.  The remaining lung fields are
 clear otherwise.  The cardiac size is top normal, but the cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities in the left middle lung field without obscuring
 the left heart border suggest left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for
 infection and/or aspiration.
