                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for low lung volumes, cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits without change.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor, there are no focal
 areas of consolidation, and lungs are clear except for linear scar at the left
 base which is unchanged from the prior radiograph.  There are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 
 However, if symptoms persist, repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory
 level may be considered to exclude a subtle pneumonia.
