 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube extends to at least the level of the stomach.  There is a
 right IJ central venous catheter terminating at the mid SVC.  The lung volumes
