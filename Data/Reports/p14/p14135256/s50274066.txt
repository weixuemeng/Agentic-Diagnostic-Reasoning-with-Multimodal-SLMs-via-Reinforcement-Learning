 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing oxygen requirement,
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable upright chest film, ___ at 14:39, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The left base and costophrenic angle are not entirely included on this study. 
 There is patchy opacity at the right medial lung base which is suspicious for
 pneumonia or patchy atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The heart appears to be
 mildly enlarged, although the left heart border is not entirely included on
 the image.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
