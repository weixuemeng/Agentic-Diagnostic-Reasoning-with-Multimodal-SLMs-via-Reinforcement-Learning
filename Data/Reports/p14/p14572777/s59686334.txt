                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, dyspnea and elevated lactate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding along the
 thoracic aorta.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality suggesting vascular
 congestion.  The lung volumes are low, but hemidiaphragmatic flattening is
 suggestive of background hyperinflation of the lungs.  The lateral view shows
 a focal posterior opacity in the left lower lobe, concerning for pneumonia. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight fluid overload.  Focal left lower lobe
 opacity is worrisome for pneumonia.
