                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, questionable mediastinal process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the previous examination, the patient has undergone CABG. 
 The clips and the sternal wires are in correct position.  Unchanged size of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged mild tortuosity.  There is a new right
 upper mediastinal contour that shows unremarkable shape and radiodensity and
 is likely caused by a slightly tortuous upper mediastinal vessel.  There is no
 displacement of the trachea.  Although it is unlikely that this change causes
 the patient's symptoms, the change could be further evaluated by CT.
 
 No pneumothorax, no hilar changes.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
