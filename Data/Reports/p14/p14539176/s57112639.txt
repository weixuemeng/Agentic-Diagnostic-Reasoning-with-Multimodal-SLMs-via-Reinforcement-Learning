                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal cell carcinoma and fall with right
 femoral neck fracture.  // Please evaluate for acute process. Pre-op exam.
 Surg: ___ (Right Femoral Neck Fracutre Repair)
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are similar to the
 recent CT.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Note is made of previous left axillary lymph node
 dissection.  Multifocal skeletal metastases have been more fully assessed by
 the outside CT, along with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.  Metastatic disease, more
 fully assessed by outside CT.
