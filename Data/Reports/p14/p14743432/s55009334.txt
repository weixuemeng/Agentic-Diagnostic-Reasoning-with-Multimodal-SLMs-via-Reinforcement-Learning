                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bacteremia  // ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:   Single AP view of the chest dated ___ at 12:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with unfolded aorta. Incidental note made of mitral annulus
 calcifications. Prominence of paratracheal soft tissues likely reflects
 vascular structures in someone of this age. The aorta is tortuous an unfolded.
 Tapered appearance of the hila raise the question of background pulmonary
 hypertension. No well defined aortopulmonary window is seen on the left,
 question due to overlap with the descending aorta.
 
 Possible minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No CHF, the focal infiltrate, or gross
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. COPD and cardiomegaly
 2. Doubt acute pulmonary process.
