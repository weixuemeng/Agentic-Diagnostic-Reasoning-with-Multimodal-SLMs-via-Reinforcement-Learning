                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 5 cm above the carina, beyond the thoracic inlet.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged, as before.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis.  There is also mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
 vascularity, but without findings suggestive of frank congestive heart
 failure.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminating in the upper trachea. 
 Cardiomegaly.  No definite acute process.
