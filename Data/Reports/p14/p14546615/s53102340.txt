 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:45 PM
  Portable semi erect AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal
  tube, its tip which projects approximately 4.4 cm above the level of the
  carina.  An enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip
  out of the field-of-view below the left hemidiaphragm.  Comparison is made to
  radiograph performed approximately 8 hours prior.  Lung volumes are low. 
  Heart size is stable.  There persists prominence of the central pulmonary
  vessels.  Perihilar opacities are symmetric.  There is no large pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // pls eval for pulm edema,
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs performed on same day on ___ at
 08:41
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs performed on same day on ___ at
 08:4, there is an increase in prominence of central pulmonary vessels, likely
 reflecting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Lung volumes are decreased. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  An ET tube and NG tube are
 appropriately positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in prominence of central pulmonary vessels, likely reflecting
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Low lung volumes.
