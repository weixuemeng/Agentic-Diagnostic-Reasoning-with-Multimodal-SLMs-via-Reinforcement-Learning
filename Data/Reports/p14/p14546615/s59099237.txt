                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // eval tube positions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP view of the chest from 2 hours later.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is noted, terminating approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina.  A transesophageal tube is noted, terminating above the diaphragm, in
 the esophagus.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, which is likely
 exaggerated by technique.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, which
 subsequently clears.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is noted.
 
 The stomach is distended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Transesophageal tube terminates in the esophagus, which on subsequent film,
 terminates in the stomach.
 2.  Borderline vascular engorgement, which subsequently clears.
