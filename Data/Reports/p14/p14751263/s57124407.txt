                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-pack-year smoking history. Presenting for respiratory distress,
 likely due to rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy with impingement of
 pulmonary arteries concerning for lymphoma.  Status post endobronchial
 ultrasound with FNA of lymph nodes with a left main bronchial stent placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again appreciated are prominent bilateral hilar masses, right
 greater than left with slight progression in size of the left hilar mass
 compatible with patient's known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy seen on
 prior CT examination.  The left main bronchial stent remains in expected
 position and appears patent.  There is re-demonstration of mild bibasilar
 volume loss; however, there is increased subtle opacity of the left upper lung
 suggestive of a component of atelectasis and collapse.  There is slight global
 increase in interstitial opacities suggestive of a component of edema.  There
 is no clear pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in size of left hilar mass with left upper lobe
 atelectasis/collapse.  A lateral view may be helpful for further evaluation if
 the patient can tolerate it.  Increased interstitial opacities compatible with
 edema.
