                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer with respiratory distress and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to yesterday's examination, there is slight increase of
 interstitial lung markings compatible with minimally increased pulmonary
 edema.  A left-sided PICC now terminates at the level of the lower SVC.  There
 is otherwise no significant change compared to yesterday's examination with
 redemonstration of large bilateral hilar masses, a patent-appearing left
 mainstem bronchial stent as well as retrocardiac atelectasis.  Persistent
 asymmetric opacification of the left lung is of unclear etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Slight progression of mild pulmonary edema with persistent left basal
 atelectasis.
 2.  Asymmetric opacification of the left lung of unclear etiology with density
 similar to layering effusion.  Conventional lateral views may be helpful if
 the patient can tolerate transport.
