 Mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. Subtle left base

 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
