 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Compared to the prior study

 limitation, there is no definite evidence of new consolidation effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. 
 A safety pin projecting over the lower thoracic spine is likely outside the
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
