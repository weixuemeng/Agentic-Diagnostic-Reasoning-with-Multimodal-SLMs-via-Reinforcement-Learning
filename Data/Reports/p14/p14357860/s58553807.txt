                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.  Assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume
 with interval increase in mild vascular congestion.  Due to poor penetration
 likely due to body habitus, assessment for edema is somewhat limited.  The
 heart remains moderately enlarged with perhaps trace pleural effusions.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to poor penetration with mild vascular
 congestion.
