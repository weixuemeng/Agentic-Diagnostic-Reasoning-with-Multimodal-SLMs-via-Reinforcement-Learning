                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis and acute kidney failure.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable with moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Again seen is a left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal atelectasis or pneumonia. A lateral view is
 recommended for better assessment.
