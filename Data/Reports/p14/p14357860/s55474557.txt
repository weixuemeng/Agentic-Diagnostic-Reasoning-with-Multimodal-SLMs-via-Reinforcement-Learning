                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased O2 saturation.  Assess for pneumonia or CHF exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are markedly low in volume, limiting assessment with at least mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and upper zone redistribution.  Given the low lung volumes
 assessment for edema is limited.  The exam is further limited due to patient
 body habitus with the suggestion of a retrocardiac opacity which could reflect
 atelectasis.  Pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiomegaly
 is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to low lung volumes and poor penetration
 with vascular congestion and unchanged cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacity,
 poorly assessed, may reflect atelectasis.
