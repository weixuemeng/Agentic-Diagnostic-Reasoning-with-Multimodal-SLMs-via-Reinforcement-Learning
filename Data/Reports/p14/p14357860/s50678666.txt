                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea with worsening cough and sputum production.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ in ___ and CTA chest
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs volumes are very low which limits evaluation.  Within this
 limitation, there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or defniite focal
 airspace consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process seen on this limited study.  If
 concern for pneumonia persists, a repeat exam with a better inspiratory effort
 is recommended to more fully assess the lung bases.
