                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unable to eat.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta again noted.  Calcification of the aorta is also redemonstrated
 particularly at the aortic arch.  There is crowding on the bronchovascular
 structures, but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Minimal hazy
 opacification in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 definitively noted.
 
 A lamellated calcified structure in the right upper quadrant measuring 19 mm
 is compatible with a gallstone, as better seen on the CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes with minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Gallstone.
