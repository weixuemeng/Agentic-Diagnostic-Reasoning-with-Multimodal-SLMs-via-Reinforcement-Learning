                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The aortic arch is densely calcified.  Otherwise, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is moderate relative
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right with patchy
 opacities in the left lower lung most suggestive of atelectasis.  Chronicity
 of diaphragmatic elevation cannot be assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  It is difficult to exclude
 a retrocardiac opacity which may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia associated
 with this appearance, but possibly elevation is chronic with minor atelectasis
 or scarring.
