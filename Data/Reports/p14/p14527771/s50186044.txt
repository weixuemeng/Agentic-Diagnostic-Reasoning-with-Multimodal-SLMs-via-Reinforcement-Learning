                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta is
 unfolded. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are
 essentially clear without focal consolidation.  There is minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis in the right lower lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present. No acute osseous abnormalities present. Moderate degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine with bridging anterior osteophyte formation are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
