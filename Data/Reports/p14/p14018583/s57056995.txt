                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with question of rib fractures. Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and and thoracolumbar spine
 radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are underinflated but clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures are
 identified.  On the lateral view, there is suggestion of subtle cortical
 step-off at the posterior aspect of the sternum, which may represent a
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle cortical step-off at the posterior aspect of the sternum, could
 represent a sternal fracture vs artifact.  Correlate clinically with anterior
 chest pain and history.
