 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, new cough, questionable aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Known post-surgical soft tissue lesion at the level of the right
 upper lobe, creating a large right perihilar opacity on the chest x-ray
 (comparison performed to ___ chest CT).  Mild atelectasis at the
 left lung bases.  No evidence of recent parenchymal changes, notably no
 evidence of infection.  The atelectatic changes are better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  Low lung volumes.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
