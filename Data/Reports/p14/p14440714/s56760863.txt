                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bronchoscopy and biopsy, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No chest radiographic comparison available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large right upper lobe consolidation, likely partly atelectatic and
 potentially partly neoplastic, given the presence of a double contour at the
 right hilus and the elevation of the right hilus.  The remaining lung
 parenchyma on the right is hyperinflated.  On the left, no abnormalities are
 seen.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax after biopsy.
