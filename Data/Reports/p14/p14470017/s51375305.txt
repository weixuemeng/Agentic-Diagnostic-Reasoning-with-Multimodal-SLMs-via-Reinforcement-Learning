 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The right

 Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is most likely due to
 atelectasis versus less likely trace pleural effusion.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There are mild degenerative changes
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm/eventration.  Mild left
 base atelectasis which is less likely trace left pleural effusion.
