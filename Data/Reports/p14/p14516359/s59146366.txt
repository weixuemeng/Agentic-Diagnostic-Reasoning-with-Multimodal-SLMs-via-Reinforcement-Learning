 1.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours with a somewhat unfolded and
 tortuous aorta and  mildly enlarged heart.  Lungs appear well inflated with a
 prominent interstitial pattern which most likely reflects age-related changes
 or small airways disease.  No focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia or aspiration.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothoraces.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  No acute bony
 abnormality.  If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be
 considered.
