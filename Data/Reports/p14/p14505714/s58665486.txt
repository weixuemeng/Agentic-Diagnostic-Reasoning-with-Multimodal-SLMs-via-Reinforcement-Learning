  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Focal opacity in the retrosternal
  clear space localizing to a medial left anterior rib. Additional nodular
  opacity in the left lung for which chest CT suggested to further characterize,
  not necessarily acutely.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/hx of lower back pain and BPH presenting with acute onset
 confusion, memory deficits, and inattentiveness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  In the lateral view there is a 2.5 cm focal
 opacity in the anterior mediastinum abutting the anterior thoracic wall in the
 retrosternal clear space. This likely localizes in the infrahilar location on
 the frontal view localizing to the region the anterior left fourth rib. There
 is also a 1.3 cm nodule projecting over the left midlung laterally. Smaller
 nodules also seen in the left lung more inferiorly. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Focal opacity in the retrosternal
 clear space localizing to the anterior fourth rib. Additional nodular opacity
 in the left lung for which chest CT suggested to further characterize, not
 necessarily acutely.
