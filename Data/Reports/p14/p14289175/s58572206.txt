                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post resection and ileocolonic stricture, now with cough
 and shortness of breath. Evaluate for an acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:
 
 Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Portable frontal chest radiograph shows low lung volumes, which results in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures. A left retrocardiac opacity is
 presumably atelectasis, however, pneumonia could be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The heart is normal size and the mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with a retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis
 or pneumonia. If possible, repeat study with improved inspiratory effort is
 recommended
