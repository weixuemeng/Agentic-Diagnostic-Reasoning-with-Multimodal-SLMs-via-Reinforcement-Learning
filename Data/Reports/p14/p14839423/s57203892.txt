                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Low-grade temp and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Previously seen
 pulmonary edema appears somewhat improved.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  Streaky left base opacity may be most likely due to combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.  The mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Previously seen pulmonary edema is somewhat improved in the interval.  Streaky
 left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
