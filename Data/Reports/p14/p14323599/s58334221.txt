  Nodular opacity on lateral in infrahilar region, question atelectasis,
  pneumonia or lower airway inflammation; possibly true pulmonary nodule,
  however.  Suggest short-term follow-up radiographs to assess for clearance, or
  chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  On the lateral view, there is
 a prominent focal infrahilar opacity that has a somewhat oval nodular
 appearance.  It may coincide with patchy streaky left lower lobe opacities and
 a lingular opacity suggesting minor atelectasis or scarring, but perhaps more
 likely correlates with streaky right infrahilar opacification.  Otherwise, the
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular infrahilar opacity, which may correspond to streaky right
 infrahilar opacities.  This appearance may be nodular appearance of the lower
 airway inflammation, infection, or even pneumonia.  However, a true pulmonary
 nodule cannot be excluded.  Depending on clinical circumstances, either
 short-term followup radiographs are recommended in order to see whether it
 persists or alternatively chest CT could be considered.
