                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of COPD and severe aortic
 stenosis, presents with shortness of breath, likely in diastolic CHF, ?
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is pulmonary edema with slight improvement compared to the
 prior study.  Persistent opacification of the left lower lobe could be due to
 edema, but in the appropriate clinical context pneumonia should be considered.
 Mediastinal widening is consistent with lymphadenopathy seen on recent CT
 study.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary edema has improved.
 2.  Persistent right lower lobe opacification is likely secondary to edema and
 atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
