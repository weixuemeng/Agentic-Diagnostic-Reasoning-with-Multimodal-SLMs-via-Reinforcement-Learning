                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-upright AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a streaky right lower lung opacification, probably in the right lower
 lobe, but similar to earlier examinations and suggestive of minor atelectasis
 or scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
