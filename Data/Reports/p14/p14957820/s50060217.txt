 INDICATION:  Status post splenectomy, evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An NG tube extends below the diaphragm into the stomach.  The left
 subclavian line is in unchanged position.  There has been interval removal of
 ET tube and esophageal temperature probe.  There has been an increase in
 retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis, aspiration or
 consolidation.  The right upper lobe opacity is unchanged. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Stable appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube extends below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Interval removal of
 ET tube and esophageal temperature probe.  Satisfactory position of the left
 subclavian central line.
 2.  Increased retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis, aspiration or
 consolidation.
 3.  No change in right upper lobe opacity.
