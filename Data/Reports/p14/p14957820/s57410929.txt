                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post exploratory laparotomy and
 splenectomy, now with respiratory difficulty.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  A nasogastric tube tip ends in the gastric fundus.  A left
 subclavian central venous catheter ends in the lower SVC.  Discoid right lower
 lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  Heterogeneous opacification of the left lung
 base, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely represents a
 combination of a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and left basal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable left basal consolidation, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration
 pneumonia, associated with a small left pleural effusion.  Stable discoid
 right lower lobe atelectasis.
