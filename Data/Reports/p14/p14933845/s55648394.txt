 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new pacemaker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Yesterday's pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement has substantially
 improved.  Minimal basal edema and moderate right lower lobe atelectasis are
 still present, and the lateral view shows small bilateral pleural effusions
 that may have been present on yesterday's frontal chest radiograph but not
 appreciated.  Pacemaker leads follow their expected courses to the right
 atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  There is no pneumothorax.
