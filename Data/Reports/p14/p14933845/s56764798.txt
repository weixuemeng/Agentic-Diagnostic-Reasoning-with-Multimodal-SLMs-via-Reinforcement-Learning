 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for lead placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, an anterior and lateral
 radiograph is not provided.  The leads are in expected anatomical position. 
 The course of the leads is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 lateral radiograph, however, reveals minimal dorsal pleural effusions limited
 to the dorsal aspect of the costodiaphragmatic sinuses.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
