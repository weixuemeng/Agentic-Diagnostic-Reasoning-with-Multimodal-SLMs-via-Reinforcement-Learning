 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:34 PM
  Low lung volumes which exaggerate the cardiomediastinal structures.
  Cardiomegaly is again noted, however, the cardiac silhouette is greater than
  expected. While these findings may be due to projection and low lung volumes,
  continued followup is recommended to rule out a pericardial effusion. Mild
  edema is noted. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:58 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pacemaker check lead placements and possible
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph ___:
 
 The lower aspect of the cardiac silhouette is excluded from the examination,
 and the course of the intended right ventricular lead is not imaged, beyond
 the level of the lower right atrium.  The atrial lead curves within and its
 tip projects over the right atrium.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or attributable mediastinal widening.  Mild pulmonary edema and
 severe pulmonary vascular congestion are present.  The mediastinal widening
 particularly to the right of the trachea is probably due to combination of
 large veins and mediastinal fat deposition.
