                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, left basilar crackles  // ? PNA     
 ? PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusion is seen.  Minimal left basal opacity is noted, overall
 unchanged since the prior study E and unlikely to represent infectious
 process.  On the other hand if that corresponds to the abnormality on the
 auscultation, assessment with chest CT for precise characterization is to be
 considered.  There is no pneumothorax.
