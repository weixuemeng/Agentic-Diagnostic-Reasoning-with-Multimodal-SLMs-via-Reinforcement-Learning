                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left mid to lower lung parenchymal opacities
 are slightly increased, consistent with progression of the known left lower
 lobe pneumonia.  Increased opacity at the left base is could be due to
 increased effusion versus worsening consolidation.  Effusion is more likely,
 given rightward shift of the mediastinum.  The right lung is clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of the known left lower lobe pneumonia.  Increased left base
 opacity could be due to increased effusion versus worsening consolidation,
 with effusion more likely given rightward shift of the mediastinum.  If
 further characterization is needed, CT can be obtained.
