                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, shortness of breath  // assess for
 pneumonia      assess for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette though the pulmonary vascular status has substantially
 improved.  Extensive bilateral apical pleural and calcific changes are again
 seen, especially on the left, consistent with old tuberculous disease.
 On the lateral view, there is a lenticular opacification at the base adjacent
 to 1 of the major fissures, most likely the right.  Although there are not
 prominent pleural effusions on either side, this configuration is consistent
 with a loculated effusion.  Asymmetric opacification at the right base
 suggests that this process is on the right side.  Follow-up study should be
 obtained to demonstrate resolution of this process.
