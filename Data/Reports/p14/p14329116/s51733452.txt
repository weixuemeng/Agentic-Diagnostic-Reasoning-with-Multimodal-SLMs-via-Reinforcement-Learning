 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // eval pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of
 bilateral, left more than right post to buckle was changes with relatively
 extensive areas of pleural thickening, pleural scarring, traction, and
 calcified granulomas. These changes are stable over time.
 New, however, is a bilateral relatively diffuse vascular pattern, combined to
 moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and highly suggestive of mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
