                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with increase sob  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild interstitial edema. 
 Rounded opacity at the right lung base may represent vascular structure as no
 clear correlate is seen on preceding abdominal pelvic CT which includes the
 lung bases.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 silhouette remains mild to moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally raises concern for mild
 interstitial edema.  Apparent nodular opacity at the right lung base does not
 have a clear correlate on subsequent CT.
