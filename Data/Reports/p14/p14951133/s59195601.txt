                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size
 remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  There
 are continued interstitial opacities which are most pronounced at the lung
 bases, which appear to be longstanding findings.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation are demonstrated, and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease.  No
 definite new areas of opacification to suggest a superimposed pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema is seen.
