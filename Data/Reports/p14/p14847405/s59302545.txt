                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest films are compared to previous x-ray from ___.
 
 Extremely low lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  Linear right basilar
 opacity is seen.  Elsewhere, lungs are grossly clear noting extremely limited
 technique.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft
 tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes suggesting the right basilar opacity
 is due to atelectasis; however, if high clinical suspicion, repeat exam with
 two views is suggested to further evaluate for possible pneumonia.
