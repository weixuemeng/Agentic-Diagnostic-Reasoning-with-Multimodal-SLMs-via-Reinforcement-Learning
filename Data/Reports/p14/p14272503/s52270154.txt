                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with dyspnea.  Congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Chest, AP semi-upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a persistent small
 to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with fissural component on the right,
 which is difficult to evaluate on the lateral view because the arms are down. 
 However, although overall fluid content has probably decreased, coinciding
 parenchymal opacity has increased.  Vague lingular opacity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with fissure ill
 component, probably with some decrease since remote prior study but with
 increased parenchymal opacity.  The latter may be due to chronic round
 atelectasis although more acute superimposed atelectatic change or even
 infection is not excluded.  Correlation with more recent prior radiography may
 be helpful if available.  .
