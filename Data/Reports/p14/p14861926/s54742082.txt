 the left lower lobe were present on ___, but had cleared by ___. 
 Biapical pleural thickening is more pronounced on the right.  It would be a
 good idea to image that more carefully with a lordotic view for purposes of

 The upper lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is normal size and there is no
 evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Dr. ___ was paged.
