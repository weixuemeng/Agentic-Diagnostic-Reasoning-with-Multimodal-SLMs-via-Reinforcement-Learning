                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Type 1 diabetes, three weeks' cough and post-tussive emesis.  Assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views with AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base is
 worrisome for pneumonia.  There are scattered increased reticular lung
 markings and fibrotic changes particularly at the right lung base and right
 lung apex.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  A followup imaging for resolution should be
 obtained in five to six weeks.  
 2.  Increased reticular lung markings and scarring, particularly in the right
 lung apex and base for which followup imaging should be obtained.
