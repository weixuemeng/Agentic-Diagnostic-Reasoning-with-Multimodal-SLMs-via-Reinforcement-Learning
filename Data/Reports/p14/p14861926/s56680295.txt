                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and chills.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a similar
 background interstitial abnormality.  The previously noted opacity at the left
 lung base has cleared although there is mild residual more medial retrocardiac
 opacity, probably not new.  The latter may be due to residual scarring or
 atelectasis.  More clearly likely to represent active pneumonia, however, is a
 new vague opacity including nodular elements within the right upper lobe with
 some mild increase in background volume loss. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the right upper lobe.  Follow-up radiographs are
 recommended to show resolution within ___ weeks.  Retrocardiac opacity,
 probable possibly scarring or atelectasis although an additional focus of
 active pneumonia is not excluded by this examination.
