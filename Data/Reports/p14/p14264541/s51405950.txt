                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Evaluation of endotracheal
 tube requested.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates near the thoracic inlet,
 approximately 7.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube passes beneath the
 left hemidiaphragm, its distal course not imaged.  Opacification in the right
 lower hemithorax suggests a pleural effusion with volume loss including mild
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures most suggestive of atelectasis.  An
 infectious causes is not excluded, however.  The left lung appears clear. 
 Although the extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, there is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the left side.  Allowing for technique, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in a somewhat high lying position, approximately 7.5 cm
 above the carina.  If clinically indicated, the tube could be advanced by
 approximately 3 cm.
 
 2.  Right basilar opacification with volume loss including suspicion for a
 pleural effusion.
