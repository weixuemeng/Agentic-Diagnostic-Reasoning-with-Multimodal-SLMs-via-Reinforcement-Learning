                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with epigastric pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC. There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is unfolded and a small
 hiatal hernia is present. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Hilar contours
 are unremarkable. Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe is nonspecific, and
 could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded. Small left pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax.
 Mild degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine as well as
 within both AC joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific patchy opacity in the left lower lobe, possibly atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion.
