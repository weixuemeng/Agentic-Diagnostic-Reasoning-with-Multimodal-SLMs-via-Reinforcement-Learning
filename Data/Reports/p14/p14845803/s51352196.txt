                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; ___ CT studies are also
 available from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  There is a nodular opacity projecting over the
 left apex that appears more prominent than on the prior radiographs, although
 it is difficult to compare to the more recent prior CT.  Although it had not
 substantially changed since the earlier CT, an apparent change in radiographic
 appearance is noted, so a followup chest CT is recommended.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Apparent increase in left apical nodular opacity since prior radiographs. 
 Although the finding had been noted as stable by a chest CT over nearly a
 year, since that time, given apparent radiographic increase, a repeat chest CT
 is recommended when appropriate to evaluate further.
