 INDICATION:  History: ___M with narcan status post suspected clonidine use  //
 ? edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.

 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is accentuated as result, appearing
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected on this supine exam.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
