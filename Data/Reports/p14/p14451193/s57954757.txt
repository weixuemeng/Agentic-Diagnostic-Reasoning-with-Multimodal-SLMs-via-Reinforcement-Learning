                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a cough productive of green sputum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Moderate-sized hiatus hernia is stable.  Cannot be sure whether there is a
 region of right infrahilar consolidation up against the lower thoracic spine
 without oblique views.  The lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural
 effusion.  Although overall heart size is normal the configuration suggests
 appreciable enlargement of the left atrium.  On the other hand pulmonary
 vasculature is unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
