                                 FINAL REPORT
 RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST AND RIBS
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___, right-sided
 rib radiographs from ___ are to be fetched.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral, with four dedicated bilateral rib views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is partly calcified.  A
 moderate hiatal hernia is noted with an air-fluid level.  An opacity in the
 right upper lobe has mostly resolved.  Streaky opacities in the right
 costophrenic sulcus suggest minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mildly
 exaggerated kyphotic curvature and a thoracolumbar compression deformity, mild
 to moderate in degree, that appears unchanged.  Small to moderate anterior
 osteophytes are present along the thoracic spine.  Moderate leftward convex
 curvature is centered along the upper lumbar spine, with incompletely
 characterized degenerative changes.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving right upper lobe pneumonia.  Moderate hiatal hernia. 
 No evidence of rib fracture.
