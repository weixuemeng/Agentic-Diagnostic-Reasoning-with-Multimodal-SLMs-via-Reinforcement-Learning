 pneumothorax.  There is marked cardiac enlargement, unchanged.  There is
 prominence of the mediastinum, particularly on the right side, which is
 unchanged from prior radiographs and probably related to a distended

 redistribution of pulmonary vasculature has resolved.  There is
 dextroscoliosis of the spine with moderate-to-severe degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine.
