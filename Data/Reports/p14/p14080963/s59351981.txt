                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx multiple myeloma with cough and
 elevated WBC count  // PNA or infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged, with some
 right-sided shift of the heart, which may be accentuated somewhat by slight
 patient rotation. Vascular calcifications of the aortic arch are also notable.
 
 There is no focal pulmonary opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Specifically, there is no evidence of a consolidative process within the
 lungs.
 
 Severe degenerative changes are seen at the left shoulder, and moderate
 changes on the right, as well as at the acromioclavicular joints. Multiple
 levels of ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament are seen,
 consistent with diffuse idiopathic sclerosing hyperostosis (DISH).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
