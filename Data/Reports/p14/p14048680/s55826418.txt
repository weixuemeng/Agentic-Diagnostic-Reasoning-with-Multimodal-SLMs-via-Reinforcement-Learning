                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 relative lucency seen superiorly suggesting underlying COPD.  There are new
 bibasilar parenchymal opacities.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 suggestive of superimposed effusion particularly on the left. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications seen at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of bibasilar pneumonia and at least
 left-sided pleural effusion.  Repeat after treatment suggested to ensure
 resolution.
