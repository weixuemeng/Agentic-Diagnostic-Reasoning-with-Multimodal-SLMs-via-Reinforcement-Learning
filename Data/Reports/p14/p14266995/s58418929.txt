                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  New pacemaker that is not working properly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  As before, there is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device whose leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The right
 ventricular lead extends somewhat further into the ventricle than before.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear
 hyperinflated.  There is patchy new left basilar opacification, suggesting
 atelectasis with a possible accompanying small pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Degenerative changes are
 similar at each shoulder with periarticular calcifications that may represent
 hydroxyapatite deposition.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Status post pacemaker placement with ventricular lead extends somewhat
 further into the right ventricle than before, but otherwise positioning
 appears unchanged.  
 
 2.  Patchy new left basilar opacification, suggestive of atelectasis, possibly
 with a small coinciding pleural effusion.
