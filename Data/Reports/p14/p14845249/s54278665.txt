                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post bypass surgery, Swan-Ganz
 catheter replaced, postoperative evaluation for Swan position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  Similar as identified on the preceding
 portable chest examination, the patient is status post sternotomy and previous
 bypass surgery.  Heart size has not changed significantly.  However, the
 pulmonary vascular pattern is congested with perivascular haze than before. 
 As on the previous examination, there is evidence of an intraaortic balloon
 pump device seen to terminate in the proximal portion of the descending aorta
 just below the aortic arch in appropriate position.  There is evidence of a
 new mediastinal drainage tube and two bilateral chest tubes advanced from
 below indicating new surgical intervention during the latest examination
 interval.  No pneumothorax can be identified.  An NG tube is seen reaching the
 lower esophagus, but apparently does not pass below the diaphragm.  No new
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New supine chest examination apparently after redo surgery. 
 Intra-aortic balloon pump device in place, moderately increased congestive
 pattern in comparison with the next previous study, but no pneumothorax or
 acute infiltrates.
