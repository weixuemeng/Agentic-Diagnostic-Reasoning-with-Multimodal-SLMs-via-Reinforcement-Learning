                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been removed.  Continued low lung volumes.  The left hemidiaphragm is more
 sharply seen, consistent with some re-expansion of the left lower lobe.  There
 is a small-to-moderate effusion with some residual atelectasis.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.  No vascular congestion.
