                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  There is mild S-shaped curvature to
 the visualized thoracolumbar spine.  The lower thoracic interspaces appear
 mildly narrowed with subchondral sclerosis at several levels with small
 anterior osteophytes.  A mid thoracic level is moderately narrowed with a mild
 deformity in which the anterior superior endplate of the lower body is
 depressed but most suggestive of a chronic finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
