                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R lung mass, liver masses, increasing SOB  //
 Acute cardiopulmonary process, evaluate reported R lung mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Enlargement of the left hilum is concerning for a
 neoplasm with widening of the superior mediastinum suggestive of mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy. Additional ill-defined opacity measuring approximately 2.3 cm
 within the left lung base may reflect a satellite lesion. There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Patchy opacities within the
 right upper lobe are nonspecific, though infection is not excluded. No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left hilar mass concerning for malignancy. Additional focal opacity in the
 left lung base is concerning for a satellite lesion.  Widened superior
 mediastinum suggests underlying lymphadenopathy.  Patchy right upper lobe
 opacity is nonspecific, but infection is not excluded.
 
 Dedicated CT imaging is suggested for further assessment if not done
 previously.
