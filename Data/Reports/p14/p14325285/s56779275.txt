                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic lung CA, question interval change in pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___ at 3:17 a.m., and allowing for technical differences, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen are opacities in the right upper zone and left mid and lower zones
 and faint opacity throughout the left upper zone which is slightly more
 apparent -- ? due to technical differences.  Minimal increased interstitial
 markings at the right base are also slightly more apparent, but similar to
 ___ at 19:45 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal, if any, interval change.
