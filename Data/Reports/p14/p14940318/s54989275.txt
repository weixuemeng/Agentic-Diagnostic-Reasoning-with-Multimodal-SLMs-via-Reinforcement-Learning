                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, sepsis, UTI versus pneumonia.  Please
 evaluate ET tube and CVL position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided
 central venous catheter that terminates in the proximal superior vena cava. 
 Enteric catheter courses below the hemidiaphragm and out of view. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.
 
 The heart is massively enlarged, increased compared to prior study. Dense
 predominantly perihialr opacifications are most consistent with edema;
 however, asymmetrically increased density projecting over the right lung may
 be due to superimposed infectious process versus layering effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Decompensated congestive heart failure. Cannot rule out
 superimposed infection. Possible layering pleural effusion on the right.
