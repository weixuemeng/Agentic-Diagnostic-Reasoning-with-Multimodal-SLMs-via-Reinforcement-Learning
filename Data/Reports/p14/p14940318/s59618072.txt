                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE ___ AT 4:25.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure and shock. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 22:41.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal superior vena
 cava.  An endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.
 A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  There has been interval improvement in lung volumes with patchy
 opacities seen in both bases likely representing areas of atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is likely layering
 moderate-sized left effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, although the
 vasculature in the perihilar region is prominent, suggestive of fluid
 overload.  Possible smaller layering right effusion.  Likely stably enlarged
 heart, although the left heart border is obscured by the layering effusion and
 probable airspace process.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
