 In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube remains in
 place and there is no definite pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas is again seen
 along the left lateral chest wall.  Position of the nasogastric tube is
 unchanged.  Increased retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume
 loss left lower lobe and small effusion.

 extending upward along the right lateral chest wall. This is consistent with
 layering effusion and volume loss at the right base.
