                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophagectomy  // f/u
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:17 pm
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the tubing to the left of the spine, presumably an
 NG tube, has been removed. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged. Skin ___ over the region of left thoracic inlet are again
 noted. Curvilinear density adjacent to the left clavicular head is unchanged
 --? drain or other iatrogenic material. No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 Subcutaneous emphysema along the over the chest walls again noted, probable
 slightly improved.
 
 As before, there are bibasilar opacities which. represent a combination of
 pleural fluid and bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. There is mild best
 plethora similar, ? slightly more pronounced, than on the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1) Right and probable small left effusion and underlying bibasilar collapse
 and/or consolidation. Allowing for differences in positioning, this is
 probably similar to the prior study.
 
 2) Mild vascular plethora may be slightly worse.
