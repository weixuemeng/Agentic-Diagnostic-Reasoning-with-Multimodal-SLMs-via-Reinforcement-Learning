                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma who
 presents for evaluation of port position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS: Chest radiographs from ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS: The left-sided port terminates in the low SVC. The heart size is
 normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is a 1.6 cm
 ill-defined, somewhat oblong opacity within the right upper lobe. Although
 this has been stable in size compared to the exam from ___, it could be
 an endobronchial malignancy or bronchiectasis, perhaps containing a mycetoma.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Left-sided port terminates in the low SVC.
 
 2. 1.6 cm oblong opacity in the right upper lobe; non-urgent chest CT is
 recommended to evaluate possible malignancy or bronchiectasis, perhaps with a
 mycetoma.
 
 These findings were submitted to the Critical Results dashboard at 2:52pm by
 Dr. ___ on the day of the exam.
