  Unchanged ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe from ___. 
  Decreased inspiratory lung volumes with slight blunting of the left
  costophrenic angle most likely reflecting atelectasis although a small pleural
  effusion is not excluded.  Unchanged position of a left Port-A-Cath.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of breast, lung and brain cancer, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There are areas of atelectasis at the left and right lung bases. 
 The pre-existing parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe is unchanged in
 size and extent.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.  Known bilateral symmetrical apical thickening.  The left pectoral
 Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
