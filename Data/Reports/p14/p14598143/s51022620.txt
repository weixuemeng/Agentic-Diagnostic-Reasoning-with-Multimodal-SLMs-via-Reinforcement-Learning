                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Upper lobe
 lucency is compatible with underlying emphysema.  Vague opacities in the lower
 lungs may represent atelectasis versus scarring.  These findings are less
 likely to reflect pneumonia.  A tiny right pleural effusion is seen.  The
 heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema with vague opacities in the lower lungs which most
 likely represent atelectasis/scarring, though pneumonia not entirely excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
