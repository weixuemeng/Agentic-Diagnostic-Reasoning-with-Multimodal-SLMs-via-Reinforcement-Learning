                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of multiple
 cancers, smoking with worsening cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Small right pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 Nodular opacity projecting over the right lung base seen on the prior study is
 not seen on the current examination and potentially may be obscured by pleural
 effusion.
