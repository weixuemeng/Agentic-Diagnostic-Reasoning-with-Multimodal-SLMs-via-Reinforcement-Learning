                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 Compared with ___ at 9:35 a.m., no significant change is detected.  Again
 seen is a right indwelling catheter, with tip near SVC/RA junction.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is opacity at right and
 left bases, with small bilateral effusions, unchanged.  Upper zone
 redistribution and mild pulmonary vascular plethora is present, but is likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
