                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ as well as a
 PET-CT scan from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF, history of newly diagnosed lung cancer with mass in
 the right lower lobe.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Port-A-Cath is seen
 projecting over the right axilla with catheter extending into the right IJ and
 tip terminating in the expected location of the superior vena cava.  A
 consolidation is again noted in the right lower lobe which is compatible with
 the patient's known primary malignancy.  Lung volumes are low which limit the
 evaluation.  The heart is unchanged in size, appearing top normal.  There is
 no overt CHF.  A small right effusion is difficult to exclude.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the right lower lobe compatible with known
 primary malignancy.  Possible tiny right effusion.  No overt edema.
