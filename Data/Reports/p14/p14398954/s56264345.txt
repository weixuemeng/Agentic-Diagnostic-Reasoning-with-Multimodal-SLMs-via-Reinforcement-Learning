 REPORT.
 
 There is patchy bilateral opacity on the right side, representing the
 patient's known tumor.  There is also some left retrocardiac and left
 costophrenic opacification, but these are markedly improved from the prior
 study.  There is no definitive acute cardiopulmonary finding.  Visualized
 osseous structures appear normal.  Port remains in good position.  There is
 multilevel mid thoracic degenerative change.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Little interval change from prior study.
