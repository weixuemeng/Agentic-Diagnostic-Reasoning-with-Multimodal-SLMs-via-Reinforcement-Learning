                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer and sepsis, increased crackles,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right perihilar mass is
 unchanged.  At the periphery of the mass, however, there is an area of diffuse
 opacity that has newly occurred and could represent either early pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Short-term followup is required.
 
 Size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Moderate retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  Changed appearance of the left lung and of the right internal
 jugular vein catheter.
