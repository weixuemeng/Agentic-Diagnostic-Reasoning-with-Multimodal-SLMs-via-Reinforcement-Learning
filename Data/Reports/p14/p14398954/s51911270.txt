                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with lung cancer, presenting with fever and
 cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___. 
 Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 increased opacities of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and possibly
 left mid-lung.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 enlarged, though exaggerated by low lung volumes.  The catheter of a right
 axillary port terminates in the right atrium.  The port has been accessed. 
 The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacities of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe,
 and possibly left mid-lung, compatible with infection superimposed on the
 patient's known lung cancer.
