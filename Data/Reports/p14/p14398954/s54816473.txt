                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sputum without fever.
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly better
 inspiration.  Again there is a right lower lobe mass with hilar and
 mediastinal adenopathy consistent with the patient's known neoplasm.  There
 may be some associated consolidation in the region at the right base. 
 Continued but decreased left basilar opacification consistent with atelectasis
 or pneumonia and pleural effusion.
 
 The effusion at the right base appears to have substantially cleared.
