                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy are again demonstrated
 as well as a right lower lobe mass, consistent with the patient's history of
 neoplasm.  There may be an adjacent area of airspace consolidation next to the
 right lower lobe mass, which could be confirmed or excluded by a standard
 lateral chest x-ray when the patient's condition permits.  Also demonstrated
 is worsening left retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, moderate on the left and
 small on the right.
