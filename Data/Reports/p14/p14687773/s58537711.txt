                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with heart failure.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pacer unit projects over the left upper chest with a lead in the
 right ventricle.  Subtle scarring is seen projecting just inferior to the
 pacer unit.  A prosthetic mitral valve is in place.  Sternotomy wires are
 unchanged.  The patient exhibits stable cardiomegaly.  There is a large right
 pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  Trace left pleural fluid is
 probably also present.  Thickening pulmonary vasculature is compatible with
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with edema and large right pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis - all compatible with heart failure.
