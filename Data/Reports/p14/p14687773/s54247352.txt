 Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 prosthetic valve in place and single-channel pacemaker lead that extends to
 the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
 
 Continued large pleural effusion with substantial volume loss in the right
 middle and lower lobes.  There may be a small left effusion.
