                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity and calcification of the
 thoracic aorta.  The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  With this in mind, patchy opacities at both lung
 bases probably reflect areas of atelectasis.  Focal aspiration and early
 pneumonia are additional considerations. Bones are demineralized and note is
 made of marked kyphosis on the lateral view as well as mild decreased height
 of upper-to-mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis.
