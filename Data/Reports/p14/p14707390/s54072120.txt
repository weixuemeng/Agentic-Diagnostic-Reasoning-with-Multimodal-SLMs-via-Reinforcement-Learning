                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic small cell carcinoma in a ___-year-old woman with
 shortness of breath and worsening chest tightness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 
 
 There has been a change in the character of opacification in the right lower
 lung.  Previously it had the quality of central mass and surrounding
 consolidation.  Mass is appreciably smaller and the consolidation could be
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  A new region of heterogeneous opacity in the left
 lung partially obscures the cardiac margin and could be a second focus of
 pneumonia.  Upper lungs are grossly clear and pleural effusion, if any, is
 small.  There is no large contour abnormality in the mediastinum to suggest
 adenopathy, heart size is normal and there is no mediastinal vascular
 engorgement to suggest cardiac tamponade.
