                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from standing.  Possible rib fractures seen on prior
 examination.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the same date obtained approximately 3.5 hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is not tailored for the evaluation of rib fractures and
 portions of the thoracic cage are excluded from the field of view.  Previously
 seen right sided rib fractures at the lateral sixth through ninth rib levels
 are partially visualized.  Lung volumes remain low with eventration and
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia is seen.  There is right basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or
 significant pleural effusion is seen.  There is some cephalization of
 vasculature and mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal clips and median sternotomy
 cerclage wires are noted.  There are calcifications of the aortic arch.  A
 small hiatal hernia is present.
 
 If indicated, dedicated rib series may be obtained for further evaluation of
 rib fractures.
