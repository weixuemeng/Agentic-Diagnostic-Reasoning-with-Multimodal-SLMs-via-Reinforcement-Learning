 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have improved,
 reflecting improved ventilation. This is particularly true at the lung bases,
 where parts of the pre-existing pleural effusions and areas of atelectasis
 have resolved.  The left PICC line is now correctly positioned.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild fluid overload persists.
