                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever, dyspnea with post-transplant lymphoproliferative
 disorder.  Questionable infiltrate on recent PET CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, consistent
 with post-radiation changes.  Surgical clips are seen overlying the right
 breast.  There is slight opacification of right heart border by an opacity in
 the right middle lobe, and the left heart border appears slightly indistinct
 with opacification of the left lung base.  These areas correspond to the
 recent opacities seen on the PET CT.  These are of indeterminate age and may
 again represent infection or an inflammatory process. Irregular lucency of the
 right distal clavicle is also a sequels of prior radiation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly similar appearance of right middle lobe and left lower
 lobe infiltrates, which may be consistent with pneumonia, although comparison
 with PET-CT is difficult.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
