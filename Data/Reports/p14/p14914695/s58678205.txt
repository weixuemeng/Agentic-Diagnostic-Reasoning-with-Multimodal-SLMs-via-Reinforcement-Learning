                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with Hep C, SOB, evaluate for pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion has increased compared with the
 immediate prior study.  There is no frank pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Of note, the right
 costophrenic angle is excluded the field of view.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes causing bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
