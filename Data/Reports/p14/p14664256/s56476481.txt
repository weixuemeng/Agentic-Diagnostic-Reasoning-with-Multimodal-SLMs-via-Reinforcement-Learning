                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The thoracic aorta is mildly
 tortuous with calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Perihilar haziness
 with vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  The lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  The costophrenic sulci posteriorly appear blunted suggesting
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  Extensive
 degenerative changes are noted within the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular
 joints bilaterally.  Mild degenerative changes are also seen within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with probable trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.
