  The Dobbhoff tube form the study earlier today appears to have been removed. 
  A new NG tube is difficult to fully delineate due to the patient's overlying
  soft tissue but does appear to course into the stomach and then is not clearly
  visible .

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of atrial fibrillation, cranial hemorrhage, evaluation
 for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:27 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a previous Dobbhoff
 catheter has been removed and replaced by a nasogastric tube.  The nasogastric
 tube shows a normal course.  The tip projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, with a left-sided correctly positioned
 PICC line.  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung
 areas.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
