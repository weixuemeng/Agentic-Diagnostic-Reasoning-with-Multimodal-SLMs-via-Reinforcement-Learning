                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post left upper extremity approach PICC
 with re-positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:36 o'clock.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval retraction of a left approach PICC with tip
 now in the mid SVC.  An enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm with
 weighted tip in the stomach.  The lungs remain low in volume, accentuating
 peribronchovascular crowding.  The heart is top normal in size allowing for
 low lung volumes and AP technique.  There is likely minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis in the left base.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left PICC status post retraction, now in appropriate position.
