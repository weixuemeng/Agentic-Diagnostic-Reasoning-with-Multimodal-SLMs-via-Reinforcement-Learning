                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left frontal intracranial hemorrhage. 
 Question ET tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube with tip
 extending to 3.4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube extends to the stomach,
 although the tip could be further distally placed by 4-5 cm to secure better
 seating.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Allowing
 for mildly decreased lung volumes, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal ET tube position.  Consider placing NG tube more distally
 by 4-5 cm.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
