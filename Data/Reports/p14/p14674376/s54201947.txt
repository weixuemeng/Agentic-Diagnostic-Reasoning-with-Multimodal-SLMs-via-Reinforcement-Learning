                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes with poor inspiratory
 effort.  Allowing for this, there is cardiomegaly.  There is left retrocardiac
 opacity and likely atelectasis at lung bases.  There is blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggestive of pleural effusions.  No pneumothoraces are
 identified.  Upper lung fields are clear.
