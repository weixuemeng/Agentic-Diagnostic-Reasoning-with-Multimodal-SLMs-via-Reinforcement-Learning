  There is worsening opacification of the right lower lobe without significant
  depression of the middle fissure suggesting consolidation rather than
  atelectasis possibly reflecting evolving pneumonia.   Endotracheal tube, left
  subclavian line and enteric tubes appear in stable position.

 INDICATION:  ___F with diffuse SAH with ventricular extension, e/o L ACA and
 AComm aneurysms on CTA, s/p intubation and EVD placement, s/p Acomm coiling on
 ___  // rule out acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position.  Heart size is within
 normal limits.  The lower lobe opacities particularly at the right base have
 continued to worsen. This may represent aspiration or pneumonia.  No
 pneumothoraces are seen.
