                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman SAH with ventricular extension, e/o L ACA and
 AComm aneurysms on CTA, s/p intubation and EVD placement  // please evaluate
 for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is improved
 aeration at the right and left lung bases, persistent, mild pulmonary edema
 indicative of volume overload.  Mid right lung opacities appear unchanged and
 may reflect pneumonia or hemorrhage as a complication of prior pigtail
 catheter placement.  The right-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in
 position, possibly within the minor fissure.  Heart size is normal with normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Pleural effusions small, if any.  No
 pneumothorax.  ET tube is appropriately positioned and a left-sided PICC
 terminates in the upper SVC.  The side port of an enteric tube terminates in
 the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Lateral right lung opacities unchanged, consistent with
 persistent pneumonia or hemorrhage from pigtail catheter placement.
