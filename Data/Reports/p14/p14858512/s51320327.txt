                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with multifocal pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is substantial interval progression of multifocal
 consolidation currently involving the entire lungs.  Heart size and
 mediastinum appear to be unchanged, although the appearance is difficult to
 interpret given the obscuration of the margins by the multifocal
 consolidations.  No interval increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 In addition to multifocal pneumonia interval development of ARDS is a
 possibility.
