                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  RSV pneumonia, with ARDS.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back through ___, including
 the most recent study from ___ at 5:37 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the upper right atrium,
 not significantly changed.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  Widespread heterogeneous
 opacities throughout both lungs are decreased compared to the prior study from
 ___ at 5:37 a.m., particularly in the mid-to-upper lungs.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in widespread bilateral heterogeneous opacities,
 consistent with improving PNA and or ARDS.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter continues to end in the
 high right atrium.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
