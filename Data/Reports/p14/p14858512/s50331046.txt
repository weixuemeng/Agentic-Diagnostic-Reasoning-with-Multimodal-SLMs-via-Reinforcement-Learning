                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen
 on this single AP view.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.  Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases likely represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
