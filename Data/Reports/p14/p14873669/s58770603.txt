 The ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  A right subclavian
 central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. A
 nasogastric tube enters the stomach, distal tip not visualized. There is no
 pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. Small layering left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  A right basilar airspace opacity with air bronchograms is more
 prominent today. A left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity has slightly
 improved following partial re-expansion of the left lower lobe.

 Evolving bibasilar pneumonia, right greater than left, after partial
