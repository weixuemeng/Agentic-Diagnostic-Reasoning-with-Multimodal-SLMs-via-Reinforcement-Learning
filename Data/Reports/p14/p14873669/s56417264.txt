 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube has been placed into the upper airway.  The
 tracheostomy tube is positioned obliquely to vertical.  A right subclavian
 central venous catheter terminates at cavoatrial junction.  The enteric
 catheter extends below the film.  Partial right middle lobe atelectasis has
 increased.  Large bilateral layering effusions are similar.

 tracheostomy tube is not positioned as vertically as expected.
