                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confirm PICC line location.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Left-sided PICC is seen, similar in position as compared to the prior study,
 terminates in the proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  However, there is no evidence of focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Left-sided PICC terminates in
 the proximal SVC.  A tubular structure is again seen projecting over the right
 abdomen.
