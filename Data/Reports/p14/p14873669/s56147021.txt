 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis and respiratory failure, endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of extensive bilateral pleural effusions and borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  In addition, perihilar haze bilaterally reflects mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no thickening of the minor fissure on the right and
 basal areas of atelectasis.  In the well-ventilated lung parenchyma, no new
 opacities have occurred.
