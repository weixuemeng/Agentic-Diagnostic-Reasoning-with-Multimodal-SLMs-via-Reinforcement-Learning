 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  There is increased
 parenchymal opacity in the right lung which is most confluent in the perihilar
 region and at the base.  There is also possible retrocardiac opacity, the left
 hemidiaphragm is not well seen, partially obscured by multiple overlying
 leads.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Partially visualized
 lower cervical/upper thoracic posterior spinal fixation hardware is seen. 
 Degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal infiltrates in the right lung with possible left
 retrocardiac opacity as well suspicious for pneumonia in the proper clinical
