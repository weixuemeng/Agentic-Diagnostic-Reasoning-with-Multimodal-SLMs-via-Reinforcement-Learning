                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post cardiac arrest.  Assess pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Lines and tubes are in standard position.  Layering
 left pleural effusion likely moderate is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left are grossly unchanged.  Pulmonary
 edema has improved.  Left upper lobe and left basilar opacities have markedly
 improved from the day before earlier in the morning.
