                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diaphragmatic recent pacer placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Patient is rotated to the right.  Patient is status post median sternotomy. 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacer is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 position of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is mild prominence of
 the central pulmonary vasculature, suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion,
 without overt edema.  There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  If there is
 high concern for pneumonia, consider dedicated PA and lateral views if/when
 patient able.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Persistent
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
