                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Repositioning of pacer wires.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 21:13.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided pacer wire is again seen from a right internal jugular
 approach, terminating by coiling in the region of the right ventricle.  The
 appearance is similar to the prior study.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  Again,
 prominence of the hila may suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
