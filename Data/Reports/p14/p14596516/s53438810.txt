                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pacemaker.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:19.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided pacer with
 distal aspect coiling in the region of the right ventricle.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette moderate to
 markedly enlarged.  There is prominence of the hila suggesting pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen, although the right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the
 image.  No new focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right-sided pacer coiling in the region of
 the right ventricle.  Suggest repositioning.
