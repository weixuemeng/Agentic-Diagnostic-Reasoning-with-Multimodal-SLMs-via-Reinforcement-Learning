                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with mental status changes.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is limited owing to low lung volumes and positioning. 
 Allowing for these limitations, again noted is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm which suggests subpulmonic effusion.  Otherwise, the visualized
 lungs do not show any focal opacities.  Cardiac size cannot be properly
 assessed due to obscuring of the right heart border, but is not significantly
 changed compared with prior study.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lateral decubitus radiograph suggested to evaluate for
 subpulmonic effusion given discrepance between right hemidiaphragm elevation
 compared to prior.
