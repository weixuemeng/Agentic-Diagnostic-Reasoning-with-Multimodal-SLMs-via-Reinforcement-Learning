                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 557
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intra-abdominal abscess, reactive
 effusion, evaluate right-sided effusion and position of endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 557 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube now lies with its tip 3.2 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Right basilar pigtail catheter remains in position.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  Overall, there is crowding of the pulmonary vascularity, but the
 vasculature is more prominent and therefore there is likely an element of
 superimposed perihilar edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Persistent but
 smaller right pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in patient positioning.
