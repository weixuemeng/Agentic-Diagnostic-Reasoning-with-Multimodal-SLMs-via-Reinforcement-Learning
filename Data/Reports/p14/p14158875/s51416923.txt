 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:21 PM
  Interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip projecting at the orifice of
  the right mainstem bronchus; retraction approximately 3 cm is recommended.
  Interval placement of an esophageal catheter with tip projecting over the left
  upper quadrant. Interval placement of a right chest pigtail catheter with
  decrease in size of right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 10:19 p.m. on ___ at the time of
  discovery of these findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent cholecystectomy, now presenting
 with altered mental status and right-sided effusion, now intubated and
 thoracentesis, evaluate for pneumothorax and evaluate endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's chest study dated ___ at ___.
 
 AP chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.  The position of the
 patient is not reported and therefore this may have been acquired in the
 supine position, especially as no air-fluid level is seen within the stomach. 
 Given supine technique, this does lower the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of endotracheal tube which has its tip in the proximal
 right mainstem bronchus.  Re-positioning was recommended, and a wet reading
 was provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:19 p.m. 
 There is also a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  There has been interval placement of a right basilar
 pigtail catheter with decrease in size of a right layering pleural effusion. 
 Lung volumes are low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  Streaky
 linear opacities in the right base and right mid lung likely reflect
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable, although the cardiac contour is
 somewhat obscured due to the low lung volumes.  No large pneumothorax.
