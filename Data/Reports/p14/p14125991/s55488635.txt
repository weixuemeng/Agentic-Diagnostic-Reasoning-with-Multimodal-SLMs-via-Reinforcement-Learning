                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:16 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The heterogeneous nodular abnormality in the left lung which developed between
 ___ and ___, while heart size dramatically increased on
 ___ has subsequently improved, nearly cleared by ___.  The
 sequence of events suggests a transient abnormality such as atypical edema,
 drug reaction or hemorrhage.  It is less likely infection, or ARDS. 
 Consolidation in the right lower lung developed between ___ and
 ___ and has improved substantially over 24 hours.  Some of the
 radiographic improvement is due to resolution of accompanying pleural
 effusion.  It is quite possible, however, that there is still consolidation
 there and the time course is not inconsistent with pneumonia.  The rapidity of
 changes strongly disfavors ARDS.  Today's study shows enough distention of
 mediastinal veins and upper lobe pulmonary vessels to point to intermittent
 cardiac decompensation as a major contributing factor, as well as possible
 right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, right internal jugular sheath ends just
 above the origin of the SVC and upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.
