                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with drug overdose, now intubated.  Monitor the
 progress of consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread severe and somewhat heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation
 progressed from ___ through ___.  Subsequently, the patient
 has been extubated, increasing lung volumes and generally responsible for
 improvement in the appearance of the lungs.  Since there has been no
 subsequent improvement, I presume the process is at least as severe as it was
 earlier.  It is so extensive that I cannot distinguish somewhat asymmetric
 edema alone from some edema and multifocal pneumonia, which is most likely. 
 Heart is only mildly enlarged.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not
 substantial.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard position.  Right
 jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.  An upper enteric drainage tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  There is no pneumothorax.
