                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of chest pain with hypertension.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or acute aortic abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is a
 right upper extremity PICC which terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  A
 large hiatal hernia is again seen and while it appears larger than in ___, it
 is unchanged from the recent CT.  The cardiac silhouette is normal and the
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  
 
 There is a mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine which is
 unchanged.  Additionally, there is a senile kyphosis present without a
 discrete compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process, however, in some cases the
 presence of a large hiatal hernia may result in chest pain.
