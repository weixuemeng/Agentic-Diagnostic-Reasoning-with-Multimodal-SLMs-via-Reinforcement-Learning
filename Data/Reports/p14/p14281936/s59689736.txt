                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with point tenderness in ribs, left lower extremity
 below knee after fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest, two views of the
 right-sided ribs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted at the aortic knob. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are
 hyperinflated but clear without focal consolidation. Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sulci posteriorly may suggest the presence of trace bilateral
 pleural effusions. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No pneumothorax is
 identified. Fracture deformity of the right proximal humerus is re-
 demonstrated, and appears chronic. Widening of the left AC joint also appears
 chronic, also reflects prior injury.
 
 A BB marker indicating the site of the patient's tenderness is identified
 adjacent to the eleventh posterior rib on the right. No acutely displaced
 fractures are visualized in the vicinity of this marker. There is minimal
 deformity of the right ninth lateral rib, however this may be chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions without other acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. Minimal deformity of the right ninth rib may reflect a chronic fracture.
 Otherwise, no acutely displaced fracture identified.
