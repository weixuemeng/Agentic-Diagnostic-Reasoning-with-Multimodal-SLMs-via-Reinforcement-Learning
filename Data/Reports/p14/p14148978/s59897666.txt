                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 show no widening and demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the
 aortic knob.  The lungs are hyperinflated and demonstrate ill-defined airspace
 opacities affecting the left upper lung and probably the right lung base as
 well; areas of lucency in the right upper lung represent underlying emphysema.
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal scoliosis is
 present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper and possible right lower lung airspace opacities in
 the setting of emphysema, concerning for pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to
 resolution.
