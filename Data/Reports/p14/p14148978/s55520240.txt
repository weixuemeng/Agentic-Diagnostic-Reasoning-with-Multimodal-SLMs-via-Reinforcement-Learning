 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:34 PM
  Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion, worsening effusions and increased
  left lower lobe opacity.  Findings are superimposed upon a background of
  multifocal pneumonia.  Apparent mediastinal widening is likely due to vascular
  congestion.   Recommend diuresis and follow-up examination.  If mediastinal
  contours do not improve and clinical concern for aortic pathology is high,
  consider CTA.  d/w ___ ___ at 9:32 pm on ___ by telephone. ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening chest pain in a patient with critical
 aortic stenosis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  Left
 pleural effusion appears to be increased.  Consolidation in the left upper
 lobe is more pronounced on the current study as compared to prior examination
 and might reflect interval progression of the known process in the left upper
 lobe seen on the prior chest CT.  Right upper lobe opacity adjacent to the
 fissure appears to be unchanged.  There is interval progression of pulmonary
 edema.  Right pleural effusion appears to be increased as well.
