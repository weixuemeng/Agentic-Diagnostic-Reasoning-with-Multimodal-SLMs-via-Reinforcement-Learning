                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recently admitted here for aortic valvuloplasty,
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is a left-sided PICC, terminating at the distal SVC.  There are
 moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, which appears increased on the
 left, although this could relate to differences in patient position. 
 Perihilar opacities are again seen consistent with pulmonary edema which may
 be slightly improved in the interval.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
