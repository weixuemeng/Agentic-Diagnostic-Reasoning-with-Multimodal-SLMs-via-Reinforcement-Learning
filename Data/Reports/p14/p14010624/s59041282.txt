                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 pulmonary vasculature, but it is still engorged.  The heart size is also
 borderline.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vasculature engorgement and cardiomegaly likely
 reflect cardiac decompensation without frank interstitial edema.
