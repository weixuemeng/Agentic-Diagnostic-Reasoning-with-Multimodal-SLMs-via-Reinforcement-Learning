 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:50 PM
  There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial
  markings suggesting mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is blunting of
  the right hemi-diaphragm suggesting a small pleural effusion. Very faint
  opacity at the right lung base is noted and likely atelectasis; however, an
  early overlying infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical
  setting.
