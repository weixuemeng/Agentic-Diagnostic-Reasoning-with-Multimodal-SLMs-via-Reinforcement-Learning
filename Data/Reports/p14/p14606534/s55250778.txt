                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of lumbar compression fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is patchy opacity in the left lower lobe
 that is probably due to minor atelectasis. Very small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Lungs appear otherwise clear.  There is a new moderate
 anterior wedge compression deformity of a mid to lower thoracic vertebral body
 since the prior study, although likely chronic.
 There is a moderate lower thoracic compression deformity and two mild
 biconcave thoracolumbar compression deformities, which are worse than on the
 prior study, although again likely chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small pleural effusions and suspected atelectasis at the left lung base.
 
 2.  New, but probably chronic compression deformities.
