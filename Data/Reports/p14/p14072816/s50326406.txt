                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 are coarse interstitial markings and upper vascular redistribution similar to
 prior exam but no focal opacity.  Moderate cardiomegaly is redemonstrated. 
 Tracheal deviation is likely due to a prominent aortic knob.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema unchanged from prior
 radiograph.  No evidence of pneumonia.
