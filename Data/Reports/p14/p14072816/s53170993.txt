                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings are probably
 more pronounced from the prior exam.  The heart remains enlarged.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous with aortic knob displacing the trachea to the
 right, unchanged.  Increased opacity along the left heart border in the region
 of the lingula could be a focal pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
 2.  Opacity in the lingula is concerning for focal pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation.  Chest radiograph after treatment is
 recommended to ensure resolution.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest radiograph after treatment to ensure resolution of
 lingular opacity.
