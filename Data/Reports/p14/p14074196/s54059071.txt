                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest and arm pain.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  The contour of the main pulmonary artery is
 prominent, similar to prior, and likely reflective of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Lungs are clear without focal or diffuse abnormality.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable mild cardiomegaly and
 enlarged main pulmonary artery contour.
