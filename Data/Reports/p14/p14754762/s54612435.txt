                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Several mild-to-moderate
 compression deformities are noted along the thoracic spine, probably chronic,
 although new since the prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Several chronic-appearing
 mild-to-moderate compression deformities along the thoracic spine, suggesting
 a sequela of bony demineralization.
