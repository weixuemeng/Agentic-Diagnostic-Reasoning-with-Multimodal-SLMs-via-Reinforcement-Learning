                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle.  This could reflect a tiny pleural effusion or
 merely be a manifestation of the AP rather than PA technique.
 
 Remainder of the study shows the cardiac silhouette to be within normal limits
 without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
