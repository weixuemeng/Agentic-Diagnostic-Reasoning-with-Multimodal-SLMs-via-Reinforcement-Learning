                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with asthma, diabetes, hypertension, history of CVA,
 subdural evacuation, distress, breathing, high aspiration risk.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-ray from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is new.  There is more bilateral pleural effusion
 with compressive atelectasis, moderate on the right side, small on the left
 side.  Aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 Cardiac contour is top normal and unchanged.  Right-sided PICC line is in
 adequate position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema is new.
 
 2.  Right moderate pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion has
 increased.
 
 3.  Bibasilar consolidation is probably atelectasis; however, superimposed
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
