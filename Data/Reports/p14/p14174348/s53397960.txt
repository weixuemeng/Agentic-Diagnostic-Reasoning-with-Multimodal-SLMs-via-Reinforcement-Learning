                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 553 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with peripancreatic fluid collection,
 abdominal pain, mild dyspnea and desaturation with movement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A supine portable chest film ___ at 554 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain markedly low.  There is crowding of the vasculature
 and interval appearance of a layering left effusion and probably smaller right
 effusion.  There is a likely bibasilar airspace consolidation which could
 reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 given the marked low lung volumes.
