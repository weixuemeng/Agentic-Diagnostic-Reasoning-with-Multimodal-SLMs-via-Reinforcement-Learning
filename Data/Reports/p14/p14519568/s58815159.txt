                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of unwitnessed fall, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low. There is slight opacification at the left
 lung base.  No pleural effusions are seen.  There are no pneumothoraces. Note
 is made of slight left pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacification likely secondary to atelectasis;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.
