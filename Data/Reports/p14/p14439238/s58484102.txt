                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent STEMI status post balloon pump placement, here to evaluate
 balloon pump position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 16:11.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A balloon pump is seen extending from the abdominal aorta to the
 level of the proximal descending thoracic aorta but with the metallic marker
 oriented horizontally, suggesting malpositioning of the balloon.  The aorta
 remains tortuous in appearance. There is calcification of the aortic knob. 
 The mediastinal contours are slightly prominent due to unfolding of the aorta
 but appears stable.  The hilar contours are within normal limits.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size.  There is streaky opacification in the right
 lung apex along the right paratracheal stripe, which may represent atelectasis
 or aspiration.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Balloon pump kinked in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.  Recommend
 repositioning.
 2.  Streaky opacification of the right lung apex may represent atelectasis or
 aspiration.
 
 Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 12:20pm
 on ___.  The ballon pump has been retracted a short distance and a repeat
 chest radiograph is planned for later today.
