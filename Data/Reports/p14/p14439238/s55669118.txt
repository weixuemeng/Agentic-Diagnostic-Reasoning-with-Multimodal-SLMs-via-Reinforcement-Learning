                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Kinked catheter, to assess for aortic anomaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change.  No radiographic evidence for aortic abnormality, though plain
 radiographs are of limited value for this purpose.  Cross sectional imaging
 could be considered as the next procedure.
