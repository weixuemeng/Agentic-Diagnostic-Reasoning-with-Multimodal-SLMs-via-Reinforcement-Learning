                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Gentleman recently moved from ___, abnormal lung exam. 
 Please evaluate for tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Three ring-like densities at the cardiac base suggest prior CABG. 
 Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  An increase in reticular markings in
 the right mid and lower lung and less pronounced at the left base is noted. 
 Additionally, the right middle fissure is displaced inferiorly representing
 volume loss.  Increased radiolucency of the right apex suggests possible
 emphysema and multiple calcified granulomas in the left upper and lower lobes
 suggest prior granulomatous infection.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  A small right pleural effusion tracks superiorly
 and into the minor fissure.  A healed right clavicular fracture is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  The reticulated appearance of the interstitium suggests interstitial edema
 or chronic interstitial lung disease superimposed on a component of chronic
 emphysema.  Recommend comparison to prior radiographs if available to evaluate
 for chronicity of these changes. 
 
 2.  Calcified granulomas suggest prior granulomatous infection; however, the
 typical appearance of acute tuberculosis is not demonstrated on this
 radiograph.
