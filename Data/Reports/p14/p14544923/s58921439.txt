                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a increased opacification within
 the right mid and lower lung zone.  Streaky opacities at the left lung base is
 likely secondary to atelectasis.  Relative to prior examination dated ___, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy, wires which appear intact.  Patient has known severe upper
 lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.  Architectural distortion and
 bilateral pleural thickening is not significantly change relative to prior
 examination.  A granuloma within the left upper lobe is stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or evidence of pulmonary edema.  A healed
 right clavicular fracture is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relative to prior examination, airspace opacification of the right mid and
 lower lobes is more conspicuous for which an infectious process is difficult
 to exclude.  Some fibrotic changes with architectural distortion and bilateral
 pleural thickening is stable in appearance relative to prior examination.
