                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cardiac arrest.*** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // ET tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, out of the field of view.  There are relatively low lung
 volumes.  Left base opacity may be due to atelectasis but underlying pleural
 effusion and/ or consolidation possibly from aspiration not excluded.  There
 is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  There is prominence of the superior mediastinum an acute
 mediastinal process such as a aortic dissection is not excluded.
 
 Mildly displaced fracture of the anterolateral right fifth rib.
