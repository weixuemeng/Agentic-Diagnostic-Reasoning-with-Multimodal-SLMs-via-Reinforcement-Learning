                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 11:42 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Foot surgery.  Fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Very low lung volumes suggest that irregular opacification of the lung bases
 is largely if not exclusively atelectasis.  The upper lungs are clear.  Heart
 size is exaggerated, probably top normal.  No pulmonary edema or pleural
 abnormality.
