                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with schizophrenia, hepatitis C presented with
 UTI, confusion now with hypotension and abdominal distention  // ? free air,
 obstruction
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Curvilinear lucency immediately above the right
 hemidiaphragm likely represents ___ artifact.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen shows multiple gas-filled loops of
 bowel, not fully evaluated.  No definite free air is identified.  Right upper
 quadrant surgical clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. No definite free air.  If there is ongoing concern for free intra-abdominal
 air, then a lateral view of the chest centered at the diaphragm and a
 decubitus view of the abdomen could help for further assessment.  Dedicated
 abdominal films could help for more complete assessment of the bowel gas
 pattern.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   If there is ongoing concern for free intra-abdominal air,
 then a lateral view of the chest centered at the diaphragm and a decubitus
 view of the abdomen could help for further assessment. Dedicated abdominal
 films could help for more complete assessment of the bowel gas pattern.
