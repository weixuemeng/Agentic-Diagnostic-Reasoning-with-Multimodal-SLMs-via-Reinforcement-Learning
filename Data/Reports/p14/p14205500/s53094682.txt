 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is widespread opacification, but predominantly involving the right upper
 and left lower lungs, new since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread opacities, but with a heterogeneous distribution,
 including more focal right upper and left lower lung opacities, overall most
 worrisome for widespread infection, with asymmetric pulmonary edema a less
 likely consideration.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
