                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier films from the same day as well as ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is widespread heterogeneous opacification in each lung, but
 predominantly involving the right upper and left lower lobes.  Interstitial
 opacities are widespread, but some areas are relatively spared such as the
 right lower and left upper lobes.  A relatively confluent area of developing
 airspace disease is noted in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.  Allowing for differences in technique,
 there has been little if any change since the recent prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread interstitial and, to some extent, airspace disease
 with a pattern more suggestive of severe widespread infection than pulmonary
 edema; clinical correlation is suggested.
