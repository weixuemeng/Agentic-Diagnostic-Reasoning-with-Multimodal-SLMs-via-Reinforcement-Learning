                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Suspected stroke status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal and
 orogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable view of the chest.

 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal right mainstem
 bronchus.  Orogastric tube appears to terminate in the lower esophagus.  Heart
 size is enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Lung volumes are low.  Small
 linear opacity at the left lung base is compatible with atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, sizeable pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates in right mainstem bronchus.  OG tube
 terminates in distal esophagus.  Small left base atelectasis.
