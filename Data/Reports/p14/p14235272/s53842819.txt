 consistent with pulmonary edema.  New bilateral lung base opacities are
 consistent with a large right and moderate left pleural effusion.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or infection.

 is most consistent with atelectasis, though infection may be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
