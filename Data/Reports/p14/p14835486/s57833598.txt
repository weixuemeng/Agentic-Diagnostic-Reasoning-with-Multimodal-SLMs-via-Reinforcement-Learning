 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:26 PM
  Right lower lobe opacities are present through multiple prior studies
  indicating chronic scarring.  Superimposed infection would be difficult to
  exclude.  Streaky opacities on the left are consistent with atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  New crackles with seizure disorder.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Slightly widened mediastinum is unchanged. 
 Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC.  New left lower lobe opacity is likely
 atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe opacities are chronic, grossly unchanged, a
 combination of atelectasis/scarring and small effusion.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.
