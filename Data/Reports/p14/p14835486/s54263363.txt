                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent extubation with possible fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  The other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some element of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the right base again most likely
 reflects combination of chronic pleural thickening, small effusion, and
 basilar atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
