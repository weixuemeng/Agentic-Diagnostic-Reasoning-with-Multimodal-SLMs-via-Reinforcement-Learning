                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is somewhat limited by the patient's body habitus. At the right
 base, there is localized pleural and parenchymal scarring with volume loss,
 which appears similar to prior exams. No new consolidation is identified.
 There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia, though given the baseline abnormality in the right lung
 base, an acute process is difficult to exclude. If indicated, short term
 followup chest radiographs or CT could be obtained.
