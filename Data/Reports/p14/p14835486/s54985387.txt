                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mild-to-moderately enlarged and perhaps somewhat
 increased in size.  The widened appearance to the mid upper mediastinum
 appears similar, allowing for small differences in rotation.  Similar to prior
 findings, there is volume loss at the right lung base and rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures, suggesting substantial atelectasis.  The lateral view
 suggests convex opacification of the posterior left costophrenic sulcus,
 indicating parenchymal opacification, pleural effusion or both, which is not
 very well seen on the frontal view.  This appearance obscures visualization of
 the posterior right hemithorax on the lateral view, but the frontal view shows
 no evidence for change.   Comparing to a prior lateral view available from
 ___, posterior opacities have decreased, however.  The left
 shoulder remains dislocated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest, including cardiomegaly,
 mediastinal widening, volume loss and atelectasis in the right hemithorax,
 probably chronic.  Possible pleural effusion on the left, potentially
 loculated, although probably not an acute process.
