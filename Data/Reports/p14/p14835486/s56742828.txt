                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest pain, altered mental status  // eval for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ abdominal CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the right.  Large left-sided pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis is noted.  Difficult to assess differences since prior CT
 but it has enlarged since ___.  Superimposed infection would be
 difficult to exclude.  Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle
 suggests small right pleural effusion as well.  Streaky right basilar
 opacities laterally has a configuration of atelectasis versus scar.  More
 superiorly, the lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 assess given rotation.  There is apparent anterior dislocation of the left
 glenohumeral joint.  This is not significantly changed since prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion, enlarged since ___.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
 Persistent left glenohumeral joint dislocation.
