 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrated right PIC
 catheter projecting over mid SVC.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle, compatible with small pleural effusion, unchanged since prior.  In
 addition, there are persistent right lung base opacities, which may reflect
 atelectasis or scarring.  Left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. 
 Heart size is top normal.  Cervical fixation hardware is noted.  Chronic left
 shoulder dislocation is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right PIC catheter projects over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
