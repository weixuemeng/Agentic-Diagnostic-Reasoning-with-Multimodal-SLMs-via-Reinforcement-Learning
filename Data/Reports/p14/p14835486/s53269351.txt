  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Right PICC is
  in the upper SVC, pulled back since the prior study when it was within the mid
  SVC.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the right since the
  prior study.  Pulmonary vascular congestion appears stable to the prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the
 nasogastric tube can now be traced to the stomach.  The tip of the tube is
 located in the proximal parts of the stomach, side port is at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The right PIC line has been slightly pulled back. 
 The tip now projects over the upper SVC.  There is evidence of increasing left
 pleural effusion and unchanged right pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 with mediastinal shift to the right.  Unchanged areas of bilateral basal
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
