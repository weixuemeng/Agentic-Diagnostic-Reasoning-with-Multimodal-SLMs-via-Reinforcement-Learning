 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC.  There is persistent
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the frontal view which may be due
 to small effusion and/or pleural thickening.  Overlying subtle mild right base
 opacity may be due to atelectasis and/or scarring.  The left lung is clear. 
 The cardiac mediastinal silhouette are stable.  Cervical hardware is noted in
 the lower cervical spine, not well evaluated.
