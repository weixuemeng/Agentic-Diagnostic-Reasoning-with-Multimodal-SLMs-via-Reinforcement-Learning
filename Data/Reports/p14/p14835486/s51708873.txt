                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and change in mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged with unchanged rightward shift
 of mediastinal structures compatible with right-sided volume loss.  Linear
 opacities within the right lung base with right costophrenic angle blunting
 likely reflect areas of scarring.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic scarring within the right lung base without acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
