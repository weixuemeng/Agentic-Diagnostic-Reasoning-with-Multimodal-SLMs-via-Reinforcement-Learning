                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and a left subclavian central venous
 catheter and oropharyngeal tube have been removed.  The patient is status post
 incompletely characterized lower anterior cervical fusion.  The heart is again
 mild-to-moderately enlarged.  Similar to prior findings, there is a
 small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion with associated opacification,
 probably due to atelectasis without substantial change.  Particularly well
 visualized on lateral view is patchy parenchymal opacification in the vicinity
 probably due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with small to moderate persistent
 right-sided pleural effusion and adjacent opacity that is probably
 attributable to associated atelectasis, although not entirely specific.
