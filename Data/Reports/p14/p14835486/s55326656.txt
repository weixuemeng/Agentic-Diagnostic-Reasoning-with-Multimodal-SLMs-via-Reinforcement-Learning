                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left pleural effusion, status post removal
 of chest tube  // evaluate for pneumothorax, recurrent effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Left pigtail catheter has been removed.  Probable small left apical
 pneumothorax.
 
 Again seen is patchy opacity at the left lung base, likely a combination of
 collapse/consolidation and pleural fluid.  There is also patchy opacity at the
 right base, similar to prior.
 
 Slight upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora is also similar to the
 prior film.
 
 As before, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of left pigtail catheter.
 
 Probable small left apical pneumothorax.  The hydro pneumothorax seen on the
 ___ CT is not well appreciated radiographically.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
