                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  PICC line placement, assessment requested.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line has been placed since the prior
 examination, terminating in the mid superior vena cava.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Opacification at the left
 lung base has improved somewhat, but suspected bilateral pleural effusions and
 patchy basilar opacities otherwise persist; although infection is difficult to
 exclude, the appearance is compatible with atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line terminating in the superior vena cava.  Patchy basilar
 opacities, most likely atelectasis.
