                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Crackles in left lower lobe.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.  There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely due to the presence of
 fat.  I do not believe there is cardiomegaly.  Aside from minimal atelectasis
 in the right base the lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or
 CHF.  Right pleural effusion is small.
