                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with HTN, anoxic brain injury, frequent PNAs presenting from
 his group home with hypoxia due to presumed aspiration PNA requiring
 intubation and chest tube placement, now s/p extubation and chest tube removal
 permitting transfer out of the MICU. Now s/p VATS with decortication and CT
 placement with thoracics on ___.  // Interval assessment after VATS with
 decortication of R pleura and chest tube placement to waterseal. Please notify
 team when on the floor so the patient, who postures due to anoxic brain
 injury, can be properly positioned. thanks!
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube overlies the right hemi thorax in similar position to the prior
 exam.
 
 A moderate right-sided hydro pneumothorax is largely stable from ___
 despite the presence of a chest tube.  Minimal opacity at the base of the left
 lung likely reflects a small effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  As before,
 the colon is distended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right-sided hydro pneumothorax is not significantly changed from ___ despite the presence of a right-sided chest tube.  No significant
 change from the most recent study.
