 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with HTN, anoxic brain injury, frequent PNAs presenting from
 group home with hypoxia due to aspiration PNA requiring intubation and chest
 tube placement, s/p extubation and chest tube removal but with reaccumulated
 pleural effusion and partially collapsed R lung, s/p VATS decortication ___,
 with chest tube in place.  // CXR 4 hours post- placement to water seal.
 Please obtain at ___ (9pm) if possible. thanks! CXR 4 hours post- placement
 to water seal. Please obtain at ___ (9pm) if possible. thanks!
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 ___, 08:10.
 
 Patient's upper extremities obscure large areas of both sides of the chest.  I
 can see that the right apical pleural drain is still in place, but it looks
 like the large right pleural effusion is larger.  I can't say whether there is
 any right pleural air collection.  Most of the right lower lung is probably
 still airless.  On the left, there is no pneumothorax, probably a small
 pleural effusion, and worsening atelectasis or pneumonia in the left lower
 lobe.  Severe gaseous distention distension of the colon is long-standing.
