                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with anoxic brain injury intubated for hypoxemic
 respiratory failure s/p chest tube placement for ?empyema.  // Eval for
 interval change in pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, right pigtail pleural catheter
 has changed in position, and a moderate sized right pleural effusion has
 apparently slightly increased in size in the interval and is associated with
 loculated hydro pneumothorax components at the right lung base.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains markedly elevated.  Within the left hemi thorax, small
 left pleural effusion has increased in size, and left lower lobe atelectasis
 has worsened.  Please see recently performed CT of the chest for more complete
 assessment of these findings.
