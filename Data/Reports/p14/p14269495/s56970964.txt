                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pna, intubated  // eval tube positions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 18:35, from an outside
 institution.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.1 cm above the level of the
 carina, slightly low in position.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm,
 terminating in the expected location of the stomach.  Evaluation of the right
 hemi thorax is limited due to several overlying external structures. In
 conjunction with the recent prior chest radiograph performed earlier today,
 there appears to be a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis and volume loss in the right lung ; additional right hemi thorax
 opacity may be due to combination of the above, however, consolidation may
 also be present.
 
 Gaseous distention of the stomach.  Gaseous distention of loops of bowel in
 the right abdomen, not well assessed on this study.  Clinical concern for
 bowel obstruction was raised; KUB would further assess.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, slightly low in position, terminating 1.1 cm above the
 level of the carina.  The endotracheal tube has subsequently been withdrawn by
 approximately 1 cm.
 
 Enteric tube in appropriate position.
 
 Limited evaluation of the right hemi thorax due to several overlying external
 structures.  In conjunction with a recent prior study, there appears to be
 moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis/volume loss in the
 right lung, pulmonary consolidation not excluded.
 
 Gaseous distention of the stomach. Gaseous distention of loops of bowel in the
 right abdomen, not well assessed on this study.  Clinical concern for bowel
 obstruction was raised; KUB would further assess.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 23:00 on ___ via telephone.
