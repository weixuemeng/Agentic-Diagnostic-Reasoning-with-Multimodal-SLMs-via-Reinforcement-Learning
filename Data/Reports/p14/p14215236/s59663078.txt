 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube has been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is
 in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly increased, reflecting
 improved ventilation, notably at the left lung bases.  Mild fluid overload,
 however, persists. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
