                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. Despite this, there is subtle increase in airspace opacity at the
 right lung base which may reflect patchy atelectasis although an early
 infiltrate cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted and may be secondary to AP projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly low lung volumes with subtle airspace opacity noted at the right lung
 base. Findings may be secondary to atelectasis in the setting of decreased
 lung volumes, but aspiration/early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
