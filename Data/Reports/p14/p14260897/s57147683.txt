                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new edema, dyspnea on exertion
 for which she was admitted to___ last week.  Chest x-ray
 apparently without evidence for CHF.  On examination, JVP is up, no crackles,
 had pneumonia diagnosed at ___ one month ago.  ? Evidence for CHF?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  Additional prior chest examinations
 consulted were dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 On the present examination, heart size is within normal limits.  No typical
 configuration abnormality can be identified.  Thoracic aorta is mildly
 elongated, but does not demonstrate any local contour abnormalities or wall
 calcifications.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no
 evidence of upper zone redistribution pattern.  The lateral and posterior
 pleural spaces are free, without evidence of fluid accumulation.  No evidence
 of interstitial or alveolar edema.  No signs of acute discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates on either side.  No pneumothorax in the apical area. 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding examination of ___, no
 significant interval change can be identified.  Previous examination of
 ___, disclosed the presence of hazy infiltrates located to the
 posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  This infiltrate had regressed
 markedly on followup examination of ___.  On all chest
 examinations, rather low-positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms were
 noted and somewhat irregular peripheral vascular distribution with
 hyper-translucent appearance on the bases was interpreted as indicative of
 COPD.  Thus, the present examination supports again the diagnosis of COPD, but
 there is no evidence of left-sided CHF.
 
 On the frontal view, again one can identify the shadow of the azygos vein in
 the right tracheobronchial angle and it does not appear to be distended. 
 Thus, the elevated JVP might have been temporary.
