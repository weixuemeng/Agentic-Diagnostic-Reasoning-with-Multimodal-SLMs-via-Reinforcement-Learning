                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of COPD with one week of cough
 and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs continue to appear hyperinflated with somewhat flattened
 hemidiaphragms consistent with patient's known history of chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There are increased right upper lobe opacities. Otherwise,
 the lungs are without any other focal consolidations, effusions, or
 pneumothoraces.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal.  Osseous
 structures are grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right upper lobe opacities may be representative of right upper
 lobe pneumonia. Followup radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended to assess for
 interval change. 
 
 2. Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with patient's previously seen chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 15:05 on ___.
