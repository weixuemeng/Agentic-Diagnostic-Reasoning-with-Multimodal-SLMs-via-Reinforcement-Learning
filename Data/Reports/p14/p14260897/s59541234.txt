 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar opacity seen on prior CT is better evaluated on CT.  Wall no lobar
 consolidation is seen.  Subtle focal bilateral suprahilar patchy opacities
 which could represent ground-glass opacity if CT were to be obtained.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen elsewhere.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Previous ground-glass opacities seen on prior CT were better evaluated on CT. 
 
 
 Subtle focal bilateral suprahilar patchy opacities may represent ground-glass
 opacity if CT obtained, were not clearly seen on chest CT scout images from
