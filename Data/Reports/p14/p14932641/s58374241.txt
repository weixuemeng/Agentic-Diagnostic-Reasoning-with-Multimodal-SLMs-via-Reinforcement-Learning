                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p thoracotomy for left upper lobectomy had
 chest tube removed  // interval change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___:48.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Most or all of the left lower lobe is still collapsed. It is difficult to say
 whether relative hyperlucency of the left upper hemi thorax is due to
 hyperinflation of the superior segment or a pleural air collection.  Moderate
 left pleural effusion is slightly larger, basal pleural tube still in place. 
 Right lung is clear.  Heart size is large, but difficult to assess because the
 left border is obscured.
