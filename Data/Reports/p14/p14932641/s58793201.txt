                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  The text of this report, above, belongs to the study of another
 patient. In this study there are significant changes in the left hemi thorax
 that I cannot explain. I believe there is at least a moderate pneumothorax,
 and continued collapse of the postoperative left lung. There may also be
 substantial hematoma in the left chest. The left pleural drain is still in
 place. Apparent widening of the mediastinum could be due to local bleeding. CT
 scanning will be necessary to assess the significance of all the findings. The
 right lung is clear. Direct notification will be made to the referring
 physician's.
