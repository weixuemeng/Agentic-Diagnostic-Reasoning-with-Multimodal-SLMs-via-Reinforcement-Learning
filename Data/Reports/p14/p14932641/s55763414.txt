 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ___'s and hx prostate cancer presenting with LUL
 squamous cell CA now s/p VATS converted to open thoracotomy, LUL lobectomy
 ___ s/p removal of one chest tube c/b mucous plugging/LLL colapse, s/p

 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 6:32 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is midline.  No other cardiopulmonary support device is
 seen.  The combination of dense consolidation and loculated pleural fluid
 filling the upper third of the left hemithorax is unchanged since ___,
 but substantially improved since the left lung was entirely collapsed on
 ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly is present throughout and there is
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is
 present.Ventilator tubing occur over is much of the right upper lobe and would
 hide consolidation in that region.  Subsequent chest radiograph should be
 taken with care to uncover the right lung.
