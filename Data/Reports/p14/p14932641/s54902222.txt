                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ___'s and hx prostate cancer presenting with LUL
 squamous cell CA now s/p VATS converted to open thoracotomy, LUL lobectomy
 ___ s/p removal of one chest tube c/b mucous plugging/LLL colapse, s/p
 multiple bronchs, s/p reintubation x2 and reinsertion of pigtail for
 hemopneumothorax  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the effusion on the left has mildly
 decreased. This causes read ventilation of a middle and lower left lung
 parenchymal component.  The large left apical opacity, however, is unchanged. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The monitoring and support devices are in
 constant position.  Due to patient rotation, very subtle right apical opacity
 is visible but likely related to patient position. However, this area should
 receive attention on further short term follow-ups, to exclude developing
 pneumonia.
