 With upright positioning the mediastinal caliber is comparable to the
 preoperative studies, not of concern for mediastinal or aortic bleeding. The
 volume of pleural air in the apex of the left hemi thorax is small. There
 could be a substantial pleural fluid collection posterior to the lung. The
 base of the postoperative left lower lobe is still completely atelectatic and
 aeration in the superior segment of the left lower lobe poor relative to the
 earliest postoperative imaging. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lung
 is clear. There is no right pneumothorax
