                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M w/ 4.1 cm FDG-avid LUL mass w/ LUL SCC, now s/p VATS->open
 LUL lobectomy w/ rib resection s/p trach/peg // eval atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study of ___, there is
 decreased aeration of the left hemithorax. Increased opacification of the left
 upper lung correlates to the large loculated anterior fluid collection seen on
 recent CT dated ___, which appears to have increased compared
 with prior studies. A pleural drain is in unchanged position at the left base.
 Mild cardiomegaly and left sided rib fractures are unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube ends 3.9 cm from the carina, and the left
 IJ CVC ends in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the left hemithorax with a probably enlarging
 anterior superior loculated fluid collection.
