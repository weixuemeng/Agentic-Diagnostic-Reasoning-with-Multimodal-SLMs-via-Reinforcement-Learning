 FINDINGS:
 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph of earlier today, there is now near
 complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, which appears to correspond to
 a combination of known large loculated fluid collection and collapse of the
 left lower lobe in this patient status post left upper lobe resection. Within
 the right hemi thorax, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.
