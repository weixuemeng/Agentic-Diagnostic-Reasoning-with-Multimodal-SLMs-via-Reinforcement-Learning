                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 The lung volumes are low most likely due to suboptimal inspiratory effort. 
 Heart size is enlarged but again it might reflect suboptimal inspiratory
 effort.  The lung bases demonstrate increased crowdedness of the vessels thus
 repeated radiograph in full inspiration is required.  There is small hiatal
 hernia noted on lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
