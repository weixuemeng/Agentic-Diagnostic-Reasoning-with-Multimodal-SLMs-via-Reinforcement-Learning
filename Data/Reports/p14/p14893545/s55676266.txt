                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, planning to start
 methotrexate.  Needs baseline examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The patient has had right mastectomy.  A well-circumscribed
 rectangular ___ x 16 mm opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the
 right third rib could be a skin nodule, given the extremely distinct
 margination.  Lateral view shows no conforming lung abnormality and suggests
 nodularity to the skin surface of the anterior chest.  Lungs are grossly
 clear.  Heart size mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence
 of central adenopathy.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not focally dilated. 
 Lateral view shows severe compression of thoracolumbar vertebral bodies, at
 least three of which have received cementoplasty.  However, this does not
 constitute a sufficient assessment of the thoracic spine.  Conventional
 skeletal radiographs of the lumbar and thoracolumbar regions are recommended.
