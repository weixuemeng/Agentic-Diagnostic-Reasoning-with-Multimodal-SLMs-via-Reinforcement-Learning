                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Retrocardiac streaky
 opacity could reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is noted.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine with anterior osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky retrocardiac opacity, possibly reflecting
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.
