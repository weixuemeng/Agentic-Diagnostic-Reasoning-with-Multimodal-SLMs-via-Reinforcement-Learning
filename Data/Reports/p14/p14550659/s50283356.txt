                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  On the lateral view, there appears to be slight
 increase in opacity projecting over the posterior lower lung, just superior to
 the level of the posterior left hemidiaphragm without clear correlate on the
 frontal view.  Findings may be due to atelectasis, however early/developing
 infectious process is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
