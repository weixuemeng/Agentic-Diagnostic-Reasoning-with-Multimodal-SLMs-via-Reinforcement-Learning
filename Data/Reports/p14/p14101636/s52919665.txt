 above the carina.  A transesophageal tube ends in the stomach.  A right
 internal jugular line ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Interval development
 of airspace opacities obscuring the left heart border may represent worsening

 transesophageal tube ends in the stomach. Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse
 in the interval.  New opacities in the lingula may reflect worsening
