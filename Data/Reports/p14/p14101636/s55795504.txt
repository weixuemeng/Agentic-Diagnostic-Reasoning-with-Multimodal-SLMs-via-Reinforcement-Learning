                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Hypertension.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___, performed one hour prior.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 5 cm
 above the carina.  A right internal jugular line ends at the cavoatrial
 junction.  A transesophageal tube ends in the stomach.  There is a new left
 pleural effusion.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild pulmonary edema
 persists. Worsening opacification in the left lung base may suggest worsening
 atelectasis, but again infection or aspiration are not excluded. Right basilar
 atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small left pleural effusion. Worsening left basilar
 opacification, possibly atelectasis, but infection or aspiration are not
 excluded. Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
