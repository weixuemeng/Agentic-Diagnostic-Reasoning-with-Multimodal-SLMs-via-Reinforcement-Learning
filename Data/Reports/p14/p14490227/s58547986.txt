                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Left lower lobe is
 collapsed, presumably due to mucus plugging, but attention to this region on
 short-term followup radiograph is suggested, particularly in the absence of
 older films for comparison.  There is likely a small adjacent pleural
 effusion.  Right lung is slightly overexpanded and grossly clear except for
 minor atelectasis in the right infrahilar and perihilar regions.
