 withdrawn, now approximately 2 cm above the carina with the chin in neutral or
 elevation.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a
 nondistended stomach.  The ECMO cannula ascends to the low right atrium.
 
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  Moderate atelectasis persists at the left
 lung base.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
