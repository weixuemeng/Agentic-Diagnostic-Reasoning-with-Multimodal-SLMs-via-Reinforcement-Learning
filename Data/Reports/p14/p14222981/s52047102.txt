 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle with partial obscuration of the left
 base is again seen, raising the possibility of small pleural effusion and
 atelectatic changes.
