                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PE's  // eval for effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 115.
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 01:15 and allowing for considerable differences in
 technique, no gross change is identified.  ET tube is slightly higher, now 5.6
 cm above the carina.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, similar in
 configuration.  NG type tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. 
 Left IJ central line tip lies at the level of the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar in configuration.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, probably with some
 atelectasis in the right upper zone, abutting the minor fissure.  There are
 small bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, also
 similar on the prior film.  Biapical pleural thickening is again noted. 
 Multiple clips again noted overlying the right scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube is slightly higher, 5.6 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, the overall
 appearance is similar.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar in
 configuration to the most recent prior film.
