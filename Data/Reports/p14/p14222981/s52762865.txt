  Compared with ___, ___, and ___ single portable
  supine view of the chest shows better aeration of the lungs.  A tracheostomy
  tube is in place.  In the interval, a right-sided internal jugular line has
  been removed.  No definite pleural effusion is identified.  Linear opacities
  at the lung bases may be consistent with atelectasis.  A right basilar opacity
  seen on prior examinations is much improved on the current examination.  Again
  seen are surgical clips in the right axilla.
  
  IMPRESSION:  Improved right basilar opacity in comparison to recent
  examinations.  No definite pneumonia identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/possible PNA  // signs of consolidation, pneumonia,
 interval changes      signs of consolidation, pneumonia, interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been removal of the
 right IJ catheter.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
 Areas of opacification at the bases most likely represent atelectasis, with
 possible small effusions.  In the appropriate clinical setting it would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
