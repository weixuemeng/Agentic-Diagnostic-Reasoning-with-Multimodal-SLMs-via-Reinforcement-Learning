                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ecmo  // s/p ECMO w/hypotension r/o PTX   
 s/p ECMO w/hypotension r/o PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes appear in good position.  The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter
 is probably in the proximal aspect of the right pulmonary artery.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax or change in the appearance of the ECMO catheter.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is poorly seen and there is hazy opacification at the base,
 consistent with layering effusion and compressive atelectasis.  There may well
 be similar changes on the right.
