                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ECMO  // eval for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is severely rotated on the current study, this limits assessment. 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter appears broad-based similar in configuration and the
 ECMO catheter is unchanged in location.  The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm
 above the level the carina.  A nasogastric tube terminates, likely in the
 stomach.  No pneumothorax seen.  Apparent hazy opacification of the left lung
 is likely due to patient positioning.  Presumed hero graft in the right
 axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Technically limited study, no convincing evidence of a pneumothorax.
