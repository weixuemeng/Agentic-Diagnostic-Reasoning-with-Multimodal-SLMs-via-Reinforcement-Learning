                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent seizure activity, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are very low with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding due to underinflation of the lungs.  Within this
 limitation, there is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is evidence of mild fluid
 overload. Evaluation of the lateral radiograph is significantly limited due to
 soft tissue attenuation from the upper arms.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 accentuated in the setting of low lung volumes but is likely within normal
 limits.  An air-filled tubular structure to the left of the trachea most
 likely represents a partially air-filled esophagus.  Note is made of a biliary
 stent in the visualized upper abdomen.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant are compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation in the setting of low lung volumes without
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia/aspiration. Mild fluid overload.
