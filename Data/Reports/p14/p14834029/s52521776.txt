                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea  // pulm edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CTA chest dated ___ as well as a chest radiograph
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 Left chest wall pacer device is again noted with leads extending into the
 region of the right atrium and right ventricle unchanged.  Aortic valve
 replacement again noted.  Midline sternotomy wires are present.  There is mild
 hilar congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  Opacity at the right lung base
 likely represents a small pleural effusion, difficult to exclude a
 superimposed pneumonia.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Heart size
 is stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Congestion with mild edema and small right pleural effusion.  Difficult to
 exclude pneumonia in the right lower lung.  Chronic right hemidiaphragm
 elevation.
