                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is prominence of the perihilar vascular structures and interstitium consistent
 with moderate pulmonary edema.  Hilar are mildly prominent.  The costophrenic
 angles are not well seen due to patient's overlying soft tissues and
 underpenetration, although small pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  Recommend
 repeat after diuresis to exclude underlying infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
