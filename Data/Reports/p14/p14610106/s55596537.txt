                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and hypotensive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic
 knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 prominence of the pulmonary arteries, better seen on the prior study,
 compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Attenuation of
 the pulmonary vascular markings towards the lung apices is compatible with
 emphysema, as seen on the prior chest CTA. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists. Increased interstitial opacities are noted predominantly involving
 the lower lobes, and likely reflective of the patient's chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a trace
 left pleural effusion, not significantly changed from the prior exam. There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small left pleural
 effusion.
 
 2. Basilar predominant chronic interstitial lung disease.  Emphysema.
