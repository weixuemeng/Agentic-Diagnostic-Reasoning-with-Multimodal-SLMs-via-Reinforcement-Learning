 HISTORY:  CHF with increased oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pulmonary
 edema is less prominent, though there is still evidence of substantial
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Mild
 left basilar atelectatic changes and blunting of the costophrenic angle are
 again seen.
