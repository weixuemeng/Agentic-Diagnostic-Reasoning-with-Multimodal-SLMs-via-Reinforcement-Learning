                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of severe COPD, assessment for chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is almost unchanged
 evidence of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  The extent and severity of
 the bilateral pre-existing parenchymal opacities is constant.  Moreover, there
 is unchanged slight increase in diameter of the pulmonary artery on the left,
 potentially suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, unchanged suggestion of a small left pleural effusion.
