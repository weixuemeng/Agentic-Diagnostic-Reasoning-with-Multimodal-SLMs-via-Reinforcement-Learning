                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure.  Eval placement of ETT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated towards the left on the table.  Compared with the prior
 study, there is increased widening of the superior right mediastinum,
 difficult to assess due to patient rotation.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 2.4 cm above the carina.  No evidence of pneumothorax or new focal
 consolidation.  The known posterior mediastinal mass is better assessed on the
 prior CT.  The known right lower chest small mass affecting the right seventh
 rib is again seen overlying the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval widening of the superior right mediastinum.
 
 2.  The new endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm above the carina.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiograph with improved positioning is
 recommended.  If this finding is confirmed on repeat radiograph, CT may be
 helpful to evaluate for an abnormal fluid or blood collection in the
 mediastinum.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings and recommendation were communicated via
 telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 09:58 on ___, ___ min after
 discovery.
