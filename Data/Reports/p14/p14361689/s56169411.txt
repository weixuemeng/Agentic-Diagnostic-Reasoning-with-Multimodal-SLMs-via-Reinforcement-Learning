                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___-___ mass, airway collapse s/p crich
 and now trach revision  // eval mediastinum     eval mediastinum
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left mediastinal shift is consistent with atelectasis.  Patient seems to be
 extubated on the current study.  Tracheostomy is in place.  No appreciable
 pneumothorax is seen.  Air surrounding the right upper trachea is unchanged.
 
 The widening of the superior right mediastinum is unchanged.
 
 Giving the above described findings, correlation with chest CT would be
 justified for explanation of the mediastinal pathology as well as left
 mediastinal shift.
