                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure  // eval for
 pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided central line terminates in the mid to low SVC, unchanged in
 position compared to prior radiograph.  In comparison to the study from ___, there has been substantial decrease in the hazy opacifications
 previously silhouetting the hemidiaphragms.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  No pulmonary edema or focal consolidations.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved bibasilar opacifications.  This may be related to improved pleural
 effusion, but could be a manifestation of a more upright positioning of the
 patient.  If the patient's clinical status permits, PA and lateral chest
 radiograph may be considered for accurate assessment of pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral chest radiograph for accurate assessment of
 pleural effusion.
