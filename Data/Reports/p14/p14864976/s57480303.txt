 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:54 PM
  In comparison to the prior study from the same day, there is new opacification
  of the right lower lobe with rightward shift of the heart, suggestive of right
  lower lobe collapse. Advancement of ET Tube by 3.0 cm is recommended for
  better positioning. Advancement of the enteric tube is recommended for better
  positioning as sidehole may be in the distal esophagus. Left sided chest tube
  noted with no definite pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle collision with polytrauma including
 bilateral frontal contusions, left hip dislocation, bilateral posterior
 acetabular fractures, splenic laceration, bilateral metatarsal fractures, left
 pneumothorax and small right frontal contusion.  Chest tube placed to
 waterseal, evaluate for reaccumulation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:31 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is within the
 stomach but the side port is in the lower esophagus.  There is no left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Compared with yesterday's radiograph there is new
 opacification at the right base which likely represents pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  There is also new shift of the heart to the right; however,
 there is no evidence of left pneumothorax or flattening of the diaphragm or
 other evidence of tension, instead this shift is related to volume loss in the
 right lower lobe.
