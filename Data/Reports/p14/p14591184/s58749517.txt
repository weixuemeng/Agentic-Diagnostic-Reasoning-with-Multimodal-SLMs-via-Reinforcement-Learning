                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are increased bibasilar opacities and prominent central pulmonary
 vasculature likely due to pulmonary edema. The costophrenic margins are
 indistinct bilaterally likely due to small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart
 size is mildly enlarged, however this may be technical due to the AP
 projection. There is no overt focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings compatible with pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions. Recommend repeat radiograph after diuresis to assess for any
 underlying abnormality.
