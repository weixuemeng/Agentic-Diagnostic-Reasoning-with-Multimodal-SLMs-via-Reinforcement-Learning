  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Persistent opacity at the left mid to lower
  lung likely in part due to an effusion. Please note that this has been a
  persistent finding and underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded. Consider
  followup CT scan to further access on a nonurgent basis.

 INDICATION:   ___F with stroke  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___. Chest
 CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to priors, there has been no significant interval change. Again seen
 is persistent opacity at the left mid to lower lung laterally, some of which
 is likely due to underlying pleural effusion. Elsewhere the lungs are clear.
 Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given silhouetting of the left
 cardiac border. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the thoracic
 aorta. Elsewhere the lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Persistent opacity at the left mid to lower
 lung likely in part due to an effusion. Please note that this has been a
 persistent finding and underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded. Consider
 followup CT scan to further access on a nonurgent basis.
