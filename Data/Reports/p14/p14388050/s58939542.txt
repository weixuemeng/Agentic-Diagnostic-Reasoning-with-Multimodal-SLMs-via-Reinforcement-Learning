                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, intubated.  Evaluation for tube placement
 after transport.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval distal
 advancement of the endotracheal tube, with tip in the right main stem
 bronchus.  The previously seen parenchymal infiltrate at the left lung base is
 again demonstrated on this study and likely represents atelectasis with
 possibly some pleural fluid.  There is bilateral pulmonary edema, left greater
 than right, which is unchanged since the prior exam.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen with tip in the distal stomach.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Endotracheal tube with distal tip in the right mainstem bronchus.
 Unchanged bilateral pulmonary edema and left lower lung atelectasis with
 possible pleural fluid.
 
 The above findings were communicated to the CCU intern caring for the patient
 by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 13:25, five minutes after discovery was made.
