                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pulm edema, SOB  // eval for pulm edema and
 possible LLL consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP images chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well-expanded. There is pulmonary edema of at least
 moderate severity.  Opacity in the left lung base likely represents a layering
 pleural effusion, possibly with some degree of loculation.  Coinciding opacity
 is probably present and compatible with atelectasis.  There is a small to
 moderate right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam. Aortic arch
 calcifications are again noted.  Results are similar to the examination from
 earlier on the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Opacity in the left lung base likely represents layering pleural effusion,
 possibly loculated to some extent.  Coinciding parenchymal opacity is probably
 compatible with atelectasis, but cannot rule out an underlying infectious
 process.
 
 2. Small to moderate right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
