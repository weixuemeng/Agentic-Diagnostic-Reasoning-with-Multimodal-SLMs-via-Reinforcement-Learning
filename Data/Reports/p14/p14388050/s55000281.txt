                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD on HD, recent L mca stroke, treated
 for HCAP on this admission. now with rising WBC count, AMS, unclear etiology. 
 // eval for interval change, new consolidation/PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The chin and overlying soft tissues partially obscure the bilateral lung
 apices.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since the study of 5
 days prior. Bilateral airspace opacities have substantially improved in the
 right lung, but persist at the left base.  A tubular opacity projecting over
 the heart may be due to coronary calcifications or stents.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly despite the projection is stable. Extensive vascular
 calcifications are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Substantial interval improvement in resolving multifocal pneumonia.
