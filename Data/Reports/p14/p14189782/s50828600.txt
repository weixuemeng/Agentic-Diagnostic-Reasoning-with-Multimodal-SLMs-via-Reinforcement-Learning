                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and CT
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There is persistent right perihilar opacification and more vague opacification
 throughout the right mid-to-lower lung.  However, compared to the most recent
 prior there has been marked interval improvement in the extent of
 opacification.  This appearance is most suggestive of resolving pneumonia but
 is not specific.  Persistent or recurrent acute process such as pneumonia is
 not excluded.  It is also possible that opacification may be due to pulmonary
 hemorrhage noting the given history of hemoptysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent but markedly improved right lung opacification.
