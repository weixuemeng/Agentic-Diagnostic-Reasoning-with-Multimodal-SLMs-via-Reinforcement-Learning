  New consolidation in the right lower lobe, in the setting of recent hemoptysis
  could represent an area of hemorrhage.  However, in the appropriate clinical,
  superimposed infection cannot be excluded. CT could be useful for further
  evaluation, if necessary. Short radiographic followup is recommended upon
  completion of treatment to document resolution.

 IMPRESSION: New consolidation in the right lower lobe, in the setting of
 recent hemoptysis could represent an area of hemorrhage.  However, in the

 further evaluation, if necessary. Short radiographic followup is recommended
 upon completion of treatment to document resolution.
