                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Followup right basilar opacity on portable exam.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to portable film
 from earlier the same day.  Right basilar opacity on this two-view exam is
 less conspicuous.  There is, however, mildly increased density in this region
 likely due to costochondral calcifications superimposed on probable bibasilar
 bronchiectasis/scarring.  Lungs are clear of large confluent consolidation. 
 There is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 slightly enlarged.  Lower thoracic/upper lumbar compression deformity is
 suspected due to acute kyphosis in this region.  However, cortical margins are
 difficult to delineate given osteopenia and overlying diaphragmatic contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right basilar opacity
 on portable x-ray likely due to confluence of shadows from costochondral
 calcifications and suspected bibasilar scarring and bronchiectasis. Suspected
 lowre thoracic/lumbar compression deformity, age indeterminate without prior.
