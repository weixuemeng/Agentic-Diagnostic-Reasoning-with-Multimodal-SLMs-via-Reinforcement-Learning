                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and tachypnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs, which are age indeterminate.  More
 confluent right basilar opacity is identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the aortic arch.  Vertebroplasty changes are seen at multiple
 thoracic and lumbar spinal vertebral bodies.  There may be anterior
 dislocation or inferior subluxation at the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, age indeterminate
 could reflect chronic underlying lung disease or intersitial edema.  More
 confluent opacities at the right lung base suspicious for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Possible right glenohumeral joint dislocation/sublexation for which
 dedicated exam can be performed.
