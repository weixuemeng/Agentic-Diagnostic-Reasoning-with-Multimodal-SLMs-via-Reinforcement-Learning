                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma, d+5 auto SCT, new neutropenic fever, question infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Right-sided central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous, with slight
 prominence of the ascending aorta.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is
 identified.  Curvilinear density at the left lung base laterally is seen. 
 This is similar to findings on a chest x-ray from ___ and therefore
 likely represents atelectasis and/or scarring.  
 
 Incidental note is made of an orthopedic anchor in the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Probable atelectasis/scarring at the left base.  Doubt penumonia. Otherwise,
 no evidence of focal infiltrate.  If symptoms worsen, consider repeat chest
 x-ray to assess for any evolution at the left lung base.
