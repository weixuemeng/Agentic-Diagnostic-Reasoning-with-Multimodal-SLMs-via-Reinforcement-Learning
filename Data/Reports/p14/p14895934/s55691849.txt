                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath. h/o multiple myeloma 
 // assess lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear. Hila and cardiomediastinal contours and
 pleural surfaces are normal.  Right clavicular lytic foci are unchanged. 
 Although suboptimal to assess for myeloma, subtle lucencies in the vertebral
 bodies and posterior ribs suggest the possibility of additional lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. Unchanged right clavicular lytic foci and possible additional lytic foci in
 the ribs and spine consistent with known myeloma.  If clinical concern for
 additional lesions, correlation with skeletal series could further evaluate.
