                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are new interstitial opacities
 throughout both lungs, findings likely suggestive of new mild pulmonary edema.
 Additionally, there is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle suggesting
 small bilateral effusions, new from prior radiograph from ___. 
 No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar
 contours are mildly enlarged, consistent with increased central venous
 pressure.  Additionally, the cardiac silhouette is also mildly enlarged as
 compared to recent prior.  Lateral projection demonstrates fluid layering
 within the major fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
