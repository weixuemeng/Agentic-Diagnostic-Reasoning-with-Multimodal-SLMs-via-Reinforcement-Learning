                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left lower rib cage tenderness, here to evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well aerated without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size
 with cylindrical densities projecting over the lateral view compatible with
 coronary stents.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of
 the aortic knob, as before.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen are compatible with prior cholecystectomy.  No displaced rib fractures
 are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No displaced rib fractures.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
