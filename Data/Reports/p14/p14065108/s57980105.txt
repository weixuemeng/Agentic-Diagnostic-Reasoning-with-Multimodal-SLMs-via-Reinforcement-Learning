                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is persistent
 left basilar opacity which likely reflects atelectasis, though pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude.  Right lung remains clear.  Small left pleural effusion
 would be difficult to exclude.  The heart size appears within normal limits. 
 The mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basal opacity likely reflects atelectasis with
 possible small left pleural effusion.  Overall appearance appears slightly
 improved from prior exam dated ___.
