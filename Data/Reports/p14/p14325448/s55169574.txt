                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent leg fracture with increased shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Right costophrenic angle is obscured,
 suggestive of small pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is noted.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart
 is mildly enlarged.  Compression deformity of mid thoracic vertebral body with
 associated kyphosis at this level is unchanged since priors.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, likely small right pleural effusion, and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
