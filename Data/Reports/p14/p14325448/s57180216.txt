                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with femur fracture.  Preoperative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There has been a significant interval
 improvement of bilateral alveolar opacities present on ___.  There
 are some residual streaky opacities in the retrocardiac space which are likely
 from atelectasis.  No pleural effusions are identified.  Previous blunting of
 the right cardiophrenic angle has completely resolved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Of note, there is an unusual curvilinear opacity tracking along the right
 margin of the mediastinum of unclear significance.  There might be mild
 cardiomegaly, although assessment is limited in this AP exam.  An old
 posterior rib fracture of the left sixth rib is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Unusual curvilinear opacity tracking along the right margin of the
 mediastinum of unclear significance. Dedicated PA and lateral radiographs are
 recommended for better assessment.
 2.  Mild left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 The recommendation in item 1 of the Impression was communicated by Dr ___ to
 Dr ___ ___ phone on ___ at 8:50 am after review of the results
 with the attending.
