                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 20:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with presumed CHF, admitted to CCU, hypoxic
 and on nonrebreather.  Evaluate for cause of hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 15:02.
 
 A portable erect chest film, ___ at 20:22 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is a diffuse bilateral airspace process, which could reflect severe
 pulmonary edema, although a diffuse pneumonia should also be considered.  In
 addition, there is a lobulated pleural opacity on the right, which may reflect
 a loculated pleural effusion.  Other pleural processes should also be
 considered.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart remains enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are widened, but this may be related to patient rotation
 on the current examination rather than representing a true finding.  Followup
 imaging may be helpful.  Asymmetry of the ribcage on the left is unchanged and
 likely is developmental.
