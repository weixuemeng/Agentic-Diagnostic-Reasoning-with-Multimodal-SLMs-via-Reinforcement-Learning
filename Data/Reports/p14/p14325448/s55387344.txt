                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with paraplegia, recent new onset of
 systolic CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, now significantly better,
 repeat chest x-ray for new baseline assessment after diuresis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in AP sitting frontal view
 and left lateral view.  Comparison is made with the preceding similar study of
 ___.  Cardiomegaly persists of at least moderate degree. 
 Thoracic aorta is mildly widened but no local contour abnormalities
 identified.  Small metallic surgical clips overlying the mediastinal
 structures at the level of the carina and identified on the lateral view in
 the region of the superior thoracic spine close to the fifth rib.  The
 pulmonary vasculature has undergone a remarkable improvement in comparison
 with the previous study where there was a clear perivascular haze and
 distended pulmonary vasculature as well as bilateral pleural effusions all
 consistent with CHF.  On today's examination there remains a mild degree of
 pleural blunting in the right lateral pleural sinus but the left-sided pleural
 sinus in the posterior areas remains free.  No new discrete parenchymal
 infiltrates can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of previously diagnosed CHF, no remaining pulmonary
 congestion and only small amount of right-sided pleural effusion remaining. 
 No new infiltrates.
