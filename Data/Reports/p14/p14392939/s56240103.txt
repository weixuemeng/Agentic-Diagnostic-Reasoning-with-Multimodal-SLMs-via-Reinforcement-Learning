                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, performed an hour and half
 ago.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior study.  A new upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. 
 The endotracheal tube is in unchanged position within 1 cm of the carina and
 if pullbacked back 2 cm would be in proper position.  Low lung volumes and
 bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged and likely represent mild
 pulmonary edema and severe bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A new upper enteric tube ends in the stomach.
 2.  The endotracheal tube terminates within 1 cm of the carina; pullback 2 cm
 for standard positionning.
 3.  Low lung volumes and bilateral parenchymal opacity persist and represent
 pulmonary edema and severe bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 10:02 a.m. at the time of discovery.
