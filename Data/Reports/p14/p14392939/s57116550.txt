                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 808
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with worsening shortness of breath and known
 pulmonary edema, question etiology.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 629.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 8:08 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent retrocardiac consolidation which could represent partial lower
 lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered.  There is
 residual streaky opacity in the right mid lung which could reflect atelectasis
 or possibly fluid loculated within the horizontal fissure.  There has been
 some interval improvement in pulmonary edema where there is now pulmonary
 venous hypertension, but no overt failure.  The heart remains mildly enlarged
 given portable technique.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No large effusions are
 appreciated.  Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissue most likely
 represents a distended azygos vein due to a fluid replete state.
