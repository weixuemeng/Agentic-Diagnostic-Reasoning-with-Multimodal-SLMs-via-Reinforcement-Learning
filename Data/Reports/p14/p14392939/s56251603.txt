                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  With increased oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Thirteen.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right IJ line with tip just below the cavoatrial junction is again visualized.
 There are bilateral lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and volume loss.  There
 are small bilateral effusions.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 CHF.  Compared to the prior study.  The amount of alveolar edema has
 decreased.  An underlying infectious infiltrate in the lower lobes cannot be
 excluded.
