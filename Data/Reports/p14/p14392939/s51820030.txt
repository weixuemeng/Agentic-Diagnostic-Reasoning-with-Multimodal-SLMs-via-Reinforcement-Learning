                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of endotracheal tube placement in a patient status
 post cesarean section with a concern for amniotic fluid embolism.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed.  An
 endotracheal tube ends within 1 cm of the carina, and if pulled back 2 cm,
 would end in the proper location.  Very low lung volumes exaggerate mild
 pulmonary edema and normal size of cardiomediastinal silhouette, and reflect
 severe bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Suggest withdrawing ETT 2 cm for standard positionning.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Severe bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 10:20 a.m. at the time of discovery.
