                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and desaturations while lying flat.  Assess
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Mild pulmonary edema has slightly
 worsened compared to the prior study from ___.  Subsegmental
 right upper lung atelectasis is increased.  Dense retrocardiac atelectasis has
 also slightly increased, likely atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 not significantly changed.  Enlargement of the azygos contour is unchanged,
 suggestive of venous distention.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval increase in mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Slightly increased dense retrocardiac atelectasis, likely atelectasis.
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
