                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right lower lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates the patient in a
 very oblique position, making it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. 
 Allowing for this limitation, there is cardiomediastinal widening.  The left
 lung is clear.  A chest tube projects over the right hemithorax.  There is a
 moderate-sized pneumothorax at the right apex, which is expected
 postoperatively.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate-sized pneumothorax at the right apex.
