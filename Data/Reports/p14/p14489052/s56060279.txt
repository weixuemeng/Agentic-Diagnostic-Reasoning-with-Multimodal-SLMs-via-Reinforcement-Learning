                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after right lower lobe surgery.  Rule out
 collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and earlier on
 ___:
 
 The remaining right lung is fully collapsed, and resides in the lower right
 hemithorax.  This atelectasis is reflected in more severe rightward
 mediastinal shift today than on ___ when the remaining right lung was
 reasonably well aerated and the persistent pleural space, air filled, was
 smaller.  The atelectasis could be due to the mucus plugging or hematoma in
 the bronchial tree, but it could also be due to lobar torsion or other
 bronchial impingement. Left lung is clear.  The heart size is probably stably
 enlarged, though the right heart is obscured by adjacent atelectasis. 
 
 ___ was paged at 8:45 a.m. as soon as the findings were detectedand
 we discussed them by telephone before 9AM.
