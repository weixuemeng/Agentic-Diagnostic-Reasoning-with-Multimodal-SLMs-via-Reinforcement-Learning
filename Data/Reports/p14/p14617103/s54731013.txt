                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman ped struck, now with significant hemorrhage  //
 Please assess for hemothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___:36.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The most important change in the radiographic appearance of the chest since
 ___:00 is the progression of the subtle increase in the uniform opacification
 of the right hemi thorax relative to. This is now accompanied by widening of
 the right lateral costal pleural margin, an indication that whether there is
 any change in the lung, there is an increase in substantial right pleural
 effusion layering posteriorly.  In this trauma patient the finding would be
 first attributed to hemo thorax left lower lobe consolidation has worsened,
 either progressive atelectasis or advancing pneumonia.
 
 ET tube still terminates in the right main bronchus. Cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal size, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Right upper lobe
 atelectasis has not cleared.
 
 Upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. Right subclavian line ends in the low
 SVC.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___, ___  by
 telephone on ___ at 9:42 AM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
