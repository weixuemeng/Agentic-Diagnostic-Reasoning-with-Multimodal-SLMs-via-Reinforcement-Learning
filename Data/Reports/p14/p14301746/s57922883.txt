 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Recurrent Spinal Intradural Meningioma,s/p
 radiation with increased cough  // ?bronchitis ,  pneumonia     ?bronchitis , 
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I am not sure whether there is a new region of peribronchial infiltration in
 the right lower lung, projecting over the anterior aspect of the sixth rib and
 just below the apex of the hemidiaphragm.  Oblique views might be helpful in
 determining if this is a real and due to pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are
 normal.
 
 Stabilization device in the mid and lower thoracic spine is not fully
 evaluated by this study but appears grossly intact.
