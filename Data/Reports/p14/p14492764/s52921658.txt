                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and rhonchi on left side. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination dated ___.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened and elongated with some wall
 calcifications at the level of the arch but no evidence of any local contour
 abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of
 acute or chronic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates is present, and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No
 pneumothorax identified in the apical area.  Although skeletal structures are
 generally well preserved in this elderly woman, there are some degenerative
 changes along the thoracic spine in the form of bridging osteophytic
 reactions, mostly along the anterior and right lateral contours of the
 vertebral bodies, but there is no evidence of any vertebral body compression
 fracture.  Remarkably, these changes existed already on the chest examination
 ___ years ago.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No significant cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates.  Similar as suggested on the
 previous examination, the relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened
 diaphragms are suggestive of some degree of emphysema; however, there is no
 evidence of any marked progression  with stable appearance of chest findings
 after ___ years examination interval.
