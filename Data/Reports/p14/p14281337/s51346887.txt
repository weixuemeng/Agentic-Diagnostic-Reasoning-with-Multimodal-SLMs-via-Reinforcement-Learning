                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with squamous cell cancer
 of the bladder after cystectomy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to chest CT from
 ___.
 
 ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Epidural catheter is projecting over the lumbar spine.
 
 Widened mediastinum is a combination of portable technique and substantial
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  Left lower lobe opacity reflects a combination of
 hiatal hernia and atelectasis, although slightly increased since the prior
 study and might potentially reflect interval development of atelectasis. 
 Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
