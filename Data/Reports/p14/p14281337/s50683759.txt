 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.  ___-year-old man with
 thyroid cancer, who has significant blood loss and requiring intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was read in comparison with the most
 recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lines and tubes are in standard position.  Both lung volumes remain
 low.  The low lung volumes, mild pulmonary edema appearance might be
 exaggerated.  Bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions and lower lung
 atelectasis is persisting.  Widening of the upper mediastinum likely due to
 mediastinal congestion is unchanged.
