 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  A line
 overlying the spine is noted, ? epidural catheter -- clinical correlation
 requested.  A left-sided pigtail catheter is present, likely in relation to
 the left kidney.  An additional vertically oriented left-sided tube or stent
 is present in the left abdomen.  
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette on this upright film,
 similar to ___ at 23:16 p.m.  There are moderate bilateral effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  These are significantly worse
 compared with ___.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 There is of bowel loop walls seen in the upper abdomen, raising the question
 of intra-abdominal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.
 2.  Moderate-sized bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation progressed significantly compared with one day earlier.
 3.  Multiple lines and tubes as described.
 4.  Outlining of a loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen is noted.  This may
 be due to overlying gastric bubble.  The differential diagnosis includes
 intra-abdominal air -- as there been a recent procedure to account for this?
