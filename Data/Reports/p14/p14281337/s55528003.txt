                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic bladder cancer with new onset rib cage
 pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Bibasal linear opacities are most
 likely consistent with areas of atelectasis and small pleural effusion,
 minimally worse since the prior study.  Within the limitations of this study
 technique, there is no evidence of rib fracture, but correlation with
 dedicated rib views is suggested.
