                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with endophthamitis, unknown etiology. ?sarcoid
 // ?sarcoidosis      ?sarcoidosis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Cardiac silhouette is within the upper limits of normal and there is no
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 Specifically, there is more prominence of the visualized right hilum and
 azygos region, though not the striking changes typically seen with
 sarcoidosis.  If required clinically, CT would be much more sensitive for
 detecting mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
