 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mvc with vent dep resf failure  // new trach
 and peg
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 05:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same
 date, the patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy tube is now
 visualized. The right PICC line and left pectoral pacer are unchanged in
 position.
 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, which are more apparent than the prior study
 but likely represent change in appearance of layering pleural effusions with
 current supine positioning.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  A PEG tube is also
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of a tracheostomy and PEG tube.
 2.  Apparent bibasilar opacities likely represent change in appearance of
 layering effusions with supine positioning.
