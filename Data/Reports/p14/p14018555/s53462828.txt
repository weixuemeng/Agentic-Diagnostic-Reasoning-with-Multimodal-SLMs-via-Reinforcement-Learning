                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p NGT placement  // s/p NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of an NG tube,
 which terminates in the stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the
 carina. The left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position, with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. One of the median
 sternotomy wires adjacent to the left sixth rib is broken, which was present
 since at least ___.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the left. Of
 note, a portion of the left inferolateral hemithorax is not captured on this
 study, but there is likely a pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable in appearance.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  NGT terminates in the stomach.
 2.  Right greater than left bibasilar atelectasis, with likely a small to
 moderate left pleural effusion.
 3. An old fractured median sternotomy wire is noted.
