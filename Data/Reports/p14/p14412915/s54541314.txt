 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 Technique:  Semi supine radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is a mild hiatal hernia.  The lungs

 lateral lung base.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The ET tube terminates appropriately above the carina.

 Wedge-shaped opacity of the right lateral lung base is concerning for
 pulmonary infarction, secondary to pulmonary emboli.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
