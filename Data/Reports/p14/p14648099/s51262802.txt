                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Resection of spinal cord tumor at T11.
 
 The patient is rotated.  This limits the evaluation of this study.  Allowing
 this limitation cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is very tortuous.  Coarse
 calcifications projecting in the right lower hemithorax could correspond to
 calcified pleural plaques.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
