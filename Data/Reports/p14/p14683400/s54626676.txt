  Small bilateral pleural effusions. Aortic tortuosity with possible prominence
  of the ascending aorta versus lymphadenopathy. Increased density along the

  differential diagnosis includes lymphadenopathy. Low lung volumes. CT is
  recommended for further evaluation. In the setting of hemoptysis and possible
