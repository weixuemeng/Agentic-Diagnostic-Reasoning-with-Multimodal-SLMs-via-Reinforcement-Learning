                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic lung cancer with increasing hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum appear to be substantially more pronounced than on
 the prior study that might reflect vascular engorgement but interval
 development of mediastinal substantial lymphadenopathy associated with
 increase in right pleural effusion and growing of the right mass is the most
 likely cause.  In addition, there is left upper lobe nodular opacity which is
 new and most likely reflecting interval development of metastatic disease,
 faintly seen on the prior radiograph in retrospect.
