                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of CHF who presents with three days of
 shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ ___.  There are mildly increased pulmonary vascular markings
 identified.  Superimposed consolidations are seen at the lung bases.  The
 costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, slightly more
 so than on prior.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 more confluent areas of consolidation at the lung bases potentially
 representing more focal consolidation/infection.
