                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent syncopal episodes.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are hyperexpanded, likely related to body habitus, as there is no
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms or increase in the retrosternal airspace to
 suggest obstructive pulmonary disease.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
