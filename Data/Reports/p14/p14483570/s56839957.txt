                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:42 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, intubated on a ventilator.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The lungs are reasonably well expanded and grossly clear. 
 Pleural effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes.  Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach.
 
 Tip of the ET tube is just above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less
 than 5 cm from the carina.  It appears to be in neutral position and therefore
 the tube is acceptable, with the opportunity to advance it 15 mm for more
 secured seating.
