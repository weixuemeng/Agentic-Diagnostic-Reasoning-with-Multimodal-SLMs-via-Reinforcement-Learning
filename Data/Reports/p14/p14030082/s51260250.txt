   In comparison chest radiographs and CTA, ___.  Comparison chest
 radiograph and intervening CTA, ___.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PE, pulm infarct, fevers  // Pneumonia     
 Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and CT scan ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidation or atelectasis is unchanged, accompanied by small
 bilateral pleural effusion.  Both examinations suggest air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm due to pneumoperitoneum, but I suspect this is instead an
 unusual appearance to segmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  I will
 discuss this possibility with house staff caring for this patient to see if
 further imaging is indicated.
 
 
 Heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax.  Upper lungs are clear.
