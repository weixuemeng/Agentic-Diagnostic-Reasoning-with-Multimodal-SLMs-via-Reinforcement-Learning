                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall , right rib bruising  // fx? ptx?        .
 Review of prior imaging studies refers to a history of chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No localizing history is available.  No dedicated rib films are obtained as
 part of this examination.
 
 Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with a heart
 size at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is calcified and minimally
 unfolded.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis, right-greater-than-left, which is slightly more
 pronounced than on ___.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No focal
 consolidation or effusion is identified.
 
 No lucent or sclerotic rib fracture line or displaced rib fracture is
 detected.
 
 Focal calcifications within the abdomen anterior to the lumbar spine likely
 lie within the aortic wall, as suggested on the PET scan from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 No obvious rib fracture is identified.  If clinical suspicion for rib fracture
 remains high and additional imaging is desired, then dedicated rib radiographs
 could help for further assessment.
