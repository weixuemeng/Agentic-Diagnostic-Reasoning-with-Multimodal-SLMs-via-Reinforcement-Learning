                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including prominence of the main pulmonary artery contour on the frontal view.
 A right upper lobe opacity has cleared.  Background reticulation of the lungs
 appears otherwise similar to the prior study.  Patchy new right basilar
 opacity tenting the right hemidiaphragm suggests minor atelectasis.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are present along
 the thoracic spine.  The bones appear demineralized.  There is at least one
 and may be more thoracolumbar compression fractures that are not well
 characterized on this study but with no indication for recent change since a
 recent prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clearance of right upper lobe pneumonia.  Patchy new right
 basilar opacity tenting the right hemidiaphragm, but most likely atelectasis.
