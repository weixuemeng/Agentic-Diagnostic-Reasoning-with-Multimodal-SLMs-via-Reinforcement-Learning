                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thyroid cancer, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again multiple
 nodular opacifications in both lungs, consistent with the diagnosis of
 metastatic thyroid carcinoma.  There is an area of right hemidiaphragm that is
 obscured on the lateral view with opacification at the base medially.  This
 raises the possibility of developing pneumonia.
