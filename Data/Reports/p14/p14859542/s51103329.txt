                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  HIV positive.  Rule out tuberculosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart size is top normal, increased slightly since the prior examination. 
 Small region of heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung
 projecting lateral to the cardiac apex may conform to similar abnormality
 projecting over the lower thoracic spine.  Would strongly recommend oblique
 views to get a second look in two projections, at the left lower lung.  This
 is unlikely to represent tuberculosis, but should be evaluated.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of central
 adenopathy.
