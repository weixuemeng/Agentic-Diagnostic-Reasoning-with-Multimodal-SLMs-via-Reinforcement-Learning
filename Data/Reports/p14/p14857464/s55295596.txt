                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, increasing white count.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, frank consolidation or effusion. 
 There is some patchy opacity at both bases and the possibility of an early
 pneumonic infiltrate or focus of aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No
 pneumothorax. No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.  Clips noted in the
 upper abdomen.
