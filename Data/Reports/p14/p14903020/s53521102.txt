                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pharyngitis, hemoptysis  // Pulmonary lesion,
 infiltrate, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 As on the previous CT neck and there is substantial prominence of the azygos
 vein that might potentially represent congenital abnormality such as
 interrupted inferior vena cava, please correlate with outside imaging if
 available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Prominent azygos vein, potentially representing interrupted IVC with azygos
 vein drainage of the lower body.
