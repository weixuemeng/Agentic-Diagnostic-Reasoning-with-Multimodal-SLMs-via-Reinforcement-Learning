                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, one episode of hemoptysis, upper airway
 tightness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is a linear streaky
 opacity in the right lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Linear, streaky opacity in the right lower lobe most likely
 represents focal atelectasis, but an early peribronchial infection could
 produce a similar appearance. Recommend short term follow up CXR to assess for
 resolution.
