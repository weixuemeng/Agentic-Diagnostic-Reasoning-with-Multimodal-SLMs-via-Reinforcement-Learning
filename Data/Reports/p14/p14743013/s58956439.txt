                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and rising white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Low lung volumes are lower still.  Heterogeneous opacification at the base of
 the left lung most readily explained by atelectasis, but I cannot exclude
 pneumonia and have paged Dr. ___ to discuss that.  Tiny left pleural
 effusion may be present.  Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax or free
 subdiaphragmatic gas.
