                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, altered mental status, sepsis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is accentuated as a result,
 appearing borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural effusion.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.  Pneumobilia is seen in the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Pneumobilia.
