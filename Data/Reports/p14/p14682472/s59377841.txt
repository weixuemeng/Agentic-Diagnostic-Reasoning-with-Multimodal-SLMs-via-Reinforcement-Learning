  1.  Left IJ CVL malpositioned with tip pointing cephalad at the level of the
  mid neck.  Recommend repositioning.
  2.  New right upper lobe heterogeneous opacity is worrisome for early
  pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
  3.  ET tube in appropriate position 4 cm above the level of carina.
  4.  Enteric feeding tube in appropriate position.
  5.  Low lung volumes with crowding of vasculature.
  6.  Improved right lower lobe opacity most consistent with atelectasis given
  waxing/waning appearance.
  7.  Mild vascular congestion.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
  telephoneon ___ at 12:29 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock ___ cholangitis s/p
 intubation  // Please evaluate ETT position and any acute process      Please
 evaluate ETT position and any acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a left IJ catheter, which trans back on itself so that the tip is in the mid
 portion of the neck.
 Indistinct area of opacification in the right upper zone medially could
 represent a developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
 Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart and the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.
