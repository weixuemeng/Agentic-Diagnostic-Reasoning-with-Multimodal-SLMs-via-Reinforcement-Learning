 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ams, nausea. vomiting  // please evaluate for
 infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  Retrocardiac opacity with air-fluid level is
 consistent with the large hiatal hernia.  There is slight blunting of the
 bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be due to pleural thickening
 versus very trace pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Partially imaged is a right humeral prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles may be due to
 pleural thickening or very trace pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
