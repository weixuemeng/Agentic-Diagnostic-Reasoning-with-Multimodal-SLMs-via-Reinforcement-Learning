                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Exam is extremely limited secondary to low lung volumes.
 Streaky bibasilar opacities most suggestive of atelectasis.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous
 and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to poor inspiratory effort without definite
 acute cardiopulmonary process.  If better evaluation is desired, repeat exam
 with improved inspiratory effort can be attempted.
