                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  There are streaky opacities in the lingula and both
 lower lobes, most suggestive of atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative
 changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and streaky basilar opacities most suggestive of
 minor atelectasis.
