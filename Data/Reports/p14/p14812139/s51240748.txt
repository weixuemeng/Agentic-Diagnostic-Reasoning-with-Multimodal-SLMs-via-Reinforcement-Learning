                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to chest radiograph 2 months prior there is no significant changes. 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There are no focal airspace opacities.  The right
 hemidiaphragm remains chronically elevated, previously described as a large
 anterior eventration.  The cardiac silhouette appears somewhat prominent
 although this is partially related to the low lung volumes. The mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The costophrenic sulci are
 sharp without evidence of effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is
 tortuous and calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process and no significant change compared to 2 months
 prior.
