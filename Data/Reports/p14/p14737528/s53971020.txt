                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Trauma film from ___ at 14:58.
 
 There is dense confluent opacification of much of the right lung, most
 pronounced in the upper and mid zones, with some sparing of the right lower
 zone. The findings in the right lung appear more confluent than on the
 presenting trauma film from ___.  There is fainter patchy opacification
 in the left upper and perihilar regions.  There is minimal increased
 retrocardiac opacity.  This contributes to obscuration of the superior
 mediastinum.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 similar, allowing for technique.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no
 overt CHF. The patient's incomplete azygos fissure is noted. 
 
 The tiny pneumothorax seen on the ___ chest CT is unlikely to be apparent
 radiographically.  No radiographic evidence of pneumothorax is detected.   
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm, overlying expected location of fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Dense right and patchy left lung opacities, consistent with areas of
 consolidation seen on the prior chest CT.  Findings on the right are more
 confluent than on the presenting chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 2) No pneumothorax detected, thugh the small ptx seen on the ___ chest CT
 would likely not be apparent radiographically.
