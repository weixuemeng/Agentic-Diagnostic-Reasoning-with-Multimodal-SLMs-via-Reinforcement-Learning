 Heart size is normal.  Patient is post aortic valve replacement, with
 overlying median sternotomy wires.  A right-sided port catheter terminates in
 the low SVC.  Compared with the prior radiograph, there are mildly increased
 interstitial lung markings, which is likely due to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  However, there is no pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
