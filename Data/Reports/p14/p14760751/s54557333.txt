                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no mild cardiomegaly
 and interstitial edema. The azygos is markedly dilated and interlobular septal
 thickening is also appreciated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Given that this patient is post-partum,
 the heart size may not be abnormal, but the presentation of dyspnea with
 pulmonary edema raises concern for cardiomyopathy.
