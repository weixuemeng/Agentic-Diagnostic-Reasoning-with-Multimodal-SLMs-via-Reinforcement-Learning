                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with new hypoxia with
 recent ERCP.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is continuous increase in right lung
 opacity that might reflect interval development of aspiration.  No free
 intraperitoneal air is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
