                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for patient
 rotation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved, accompanied by
 decreased perihilar haziness.  However, two focal areas of consolidation in
 the right lower lung are new.  Considering the presence of transient right
 lung consolidation on earlier chest x-ray of ___, this may be due
 to recurrent aspiration and less likely asymmetrical edema.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing infectious
 pneumonia.  Apparent increased opacity adjacent to left heart border probably
 represents accentuation of pericardial fat on this rotated radiograph, but
 attention to this region on followup CXR with improved positioning would be
 helpful to exclude a lingular abnormality.
