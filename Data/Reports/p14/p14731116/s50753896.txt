                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the lung,
 currently on chemotherapy.  She presents for evaluation of chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There are bilateral reticular opacities, right
 greater than left, which may reflect underlying chronic lung disease or
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis, underlying infection not excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Osseous structures
 are heterogeneous in appearance and difficult to fully assess.  Note is made
 of a 1.2 cm sclerotic focus in the left proximal humerus, which may represent
 a bone island but metastatic disease is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse reticular opacities, more confluent in appearance at the right
 lung base.  These findings may be due to a combination of chronic lung
 disease, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, with superimposed infection not
 excluded.
 2.  1.2 cm sclerotic focus in the left proximal humerus, which may represent a
 bone island or metastatic lesion.  Dedicated imaging could be performed on a
 nonurgent basis, if priors are not available for comparison.
