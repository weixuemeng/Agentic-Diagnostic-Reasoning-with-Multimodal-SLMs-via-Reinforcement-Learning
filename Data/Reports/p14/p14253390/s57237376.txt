 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobhoff tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Dobhoff tube tip is in the stomach, but the upper portion of the Dobhoff tip
 is still in the distal esophagus and should be advanced for more standard
 position.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Left subclavian
 catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly
 is stable.  The apices of the lungs are obscured by the patient's chin. 
 Enlarging bibasilar opacities are consistent with increasing atelectasis. 
 There is mild vascular congestion.
