                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the left base with lower lung volumes.  Although this could
 merely reflect post-operative atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 No definite vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is more prominent, though
 this may merely be a manifestation of the low lung volumes.
