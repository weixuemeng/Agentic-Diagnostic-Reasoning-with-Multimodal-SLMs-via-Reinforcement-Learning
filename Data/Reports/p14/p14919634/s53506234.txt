  1. Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube.  Additional midline catheter
  projecting 1 cm above the carina likely corresponds to the NGT intentionally
  placed in the upper esophagus (per OMR).  Tip of the left IJ projects over the
  mid SVC.  Bilateral chest tubes, typically oriented on the right, and basilar
  in location on the left.  Bilateral bronchial stents have not migrated.
  2. Extensive bilateral airspace consolidations are not significantly changed. 
  No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheoesophageal fistula s/p trach, open
 GJ tube, and transverse esophageal stapling  // r/o pneumothorax,
 pneumomediastinum, verify position of chest tubes, interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph from earlier the same date, it an endotracheal
 tube is been exchanged for tracheostomy tube, with tip terminating 3.4 cm
 above the carina.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. 
 Exam is otherwise similar to the recent study except for resolution of gastric
 distension.
