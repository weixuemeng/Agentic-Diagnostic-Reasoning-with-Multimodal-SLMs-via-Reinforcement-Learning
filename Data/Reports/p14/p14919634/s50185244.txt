 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach, GJ tube, and tracheoesophageal
 fistula s/p transverse stapling of esophagus, now with NG tube for suctioning
 secretions out of blind pouch  // verify NG tube repositioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a nasogastric tube is
 present, with tip terminating in the proximal thoracic esophagus, the
 potentially within the site of reported blind pouch.  Clinical correlation
 suggested.  Bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities are
 relatively similar to the recent radiograph except for interval worsening in
 the left lower lung.  No other relevant change.
