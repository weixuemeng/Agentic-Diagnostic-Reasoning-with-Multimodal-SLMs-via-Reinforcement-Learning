                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ICD, lead placement, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the external pacemaker lead
 that the patient has recently received is in unchanged position.  Also
 unchanged is the left chest tube.  The blunting of the left costophrenic sinus
 is less severe than on the previous image, this is likely reflecting a
 decrease in extent of pleural effusion.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly persists.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
