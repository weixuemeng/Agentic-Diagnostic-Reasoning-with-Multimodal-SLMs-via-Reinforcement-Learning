 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:30 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress, question
 worsening opacity.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 630 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening airspace consolidation at the right lung base which could
 reflect worsening pneumonia, although the pulmonary vasculature looks more
 ill-defined and therefore superimposed edema should also be considered.  There
 continues to be a small right pleural effusion, but now visualized is a small
 left effusion as well.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
