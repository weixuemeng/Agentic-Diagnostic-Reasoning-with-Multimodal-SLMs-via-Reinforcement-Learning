                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  Left lower lobe segmental consolidation with additional left lower
 lobar bronchiectasis (best seen on frontal view, in retrocardiac location), is
 compatible with pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear. Subtle opacity at the
 right base may be atelectasis or additional focus of infection. Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia in the background of mild bronchiectasis. Subtle
 opacities at the right base may be atelectatic or represent an additional
 focus of infection.
