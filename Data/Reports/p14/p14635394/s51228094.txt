                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoglycemia, prior abdominal pain, elevated lactate, acute
 kidney injury.  Evaluate for acute changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is severely limited by body habitus.  Within these
 limitations, the lungs are moderately well expanded.  There is no definite
 focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 known pericardial fat, better seen on CT of ___. Given extrapleural and
 pericardial fat, widening of the mediastinum is also likely due to mediastinal
 fat.  There is no large pneumothorax.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulcus
 posteriorly likely reflects small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severely limited study, but no definite evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
