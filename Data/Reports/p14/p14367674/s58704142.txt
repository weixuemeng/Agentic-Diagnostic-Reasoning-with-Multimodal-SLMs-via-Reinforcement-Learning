                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with R CVL.  Confirm right IJ central venous line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 01:56.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a new right central venous catheter terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion with interval increase in the opacification of
 the right lung base, possibly representing pulmonary edema, atelectasis or
 infection.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.   Midline sternal wires are
 intact and well aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 Interval increase in the opacification of the right lung base, possibly
 representing pulmonary edema, atelectasis or infection.
