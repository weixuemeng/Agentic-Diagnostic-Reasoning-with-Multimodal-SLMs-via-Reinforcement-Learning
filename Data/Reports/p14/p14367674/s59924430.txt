                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MMI admitted to ICU with septic shock
 secondary to PNA, developed pulmonary edema now s/p IV diuresis but still with
 3L O2 requirement  // Reassess for pulmonary edema and/or ongoing evidence of
 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of the right internal jugular central venous catheter.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes with increased bilateral, predominantly perihilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect pulmonary edema.  Superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 The size and appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  A superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
