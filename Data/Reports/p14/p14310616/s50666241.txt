 INDICATION:  History of uterine cancer, here to evaluate for pulmonary
 metastatic disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary lesions are
 identified.  The pleura is not thickened.  The visualized upper abdomen is
