                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of dyspnea, history of uterine cancer.  Please evaluate. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___ 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  There appears to be slight increased fullness of
 the left hilum, however this may be positional.  New bilateralnodular
 opacities are seen throughout both lungs.  There is a new focal opacity  in
 the lingula as well.  There is no large pleural effusion or significant
 pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New multiple nodular opacities seen throughout the lungs bilaterally. 
 Additional focal consolidation in the lingula.  Given the patient's history of
 malignancy, a chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
