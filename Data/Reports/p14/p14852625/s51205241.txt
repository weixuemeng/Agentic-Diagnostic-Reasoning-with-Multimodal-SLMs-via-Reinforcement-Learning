                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary contusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT chest on ___ at 01:58.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Peripheral opacities seen predominately at
 the base of the right lung as well as at the base of the left lung (more
 subtly) are consistent with pulmonary contusions as better seen on recent
 chest CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral, peripheral opacities consistent with pulmonary contusions as seen
 on recent chest CT.  Tiny pneumothorax seen on the preceding CT is not
 visible.
