                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent ICD placement, question of decreased
 right-sided breath sounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, PET-CT ___, CTA
 chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right AICD device with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is moderately
 enlarged, as seen previously.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with
 unchanged left-sided hilar retraction.  Patient is status post left upper lobe
 wedge resection.  Juxta phrenic peaks are noted on the left indicative of
 volume loss.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Known soft tissue lesion along the resection margin is better
 appreciated on the previous CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. AICD device in appropriate position.  No pneumothorax.
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
