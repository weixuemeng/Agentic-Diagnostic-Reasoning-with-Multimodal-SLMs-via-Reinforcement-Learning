 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable radiograph the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, terminating approximately 6
 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses through the
 esophagus, below the diaphragm and out of view.  The lungs are well-expanded. 
 There is indistinctness of the hilar structures and peribronchial cuffing. 
 Hazy opacities are present in the bilateral lower lungs.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  Mediastinal vascular clips and chain sutures in the left
 apex are related to prior wedge resection, along with a rounded opacity in the
 left upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Monitoring and support devices are in appropriate position.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Rounded opacity in the left upper lobe warrants further evaluation with
 conventional radiographs after resolution of acute symptoms.  If persistent,
 CT would be recommended to exclude recurrent disease such as malignant same in
 this patient status post previous wedge resection.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 
 1. Recommend conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs for further
 evaluation of left upper lobe rounded opacity after resolution of acute
 symptoms.
