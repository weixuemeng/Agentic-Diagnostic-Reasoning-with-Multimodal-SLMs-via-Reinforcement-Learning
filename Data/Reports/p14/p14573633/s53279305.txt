  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC.  There is subtle
  opacity at the right lung base which may represent a developing
  pneumonia/aspiration.  Postoperative changes at the left paraaortic region and
  left upper lung is again noted.  There is mild central vascular congestion
  with cephalization of vessels.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with myocarditis  // eval for pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has undergone
 recent placement of right internal jugular catheter terminating in the lower
 superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Postoperative changes at
 left upper lobe resection site show interval decrease in the degree of
 opacification adjacent to surgical chain sutures with residual opacity more
 fully characterized on subsequently performed chest CTA dictated separately. 
 Exam is otherwise remarkable for new bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 due to aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia.  Very small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
