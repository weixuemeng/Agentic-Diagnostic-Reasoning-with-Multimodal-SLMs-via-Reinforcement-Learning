                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Increased
 interstitial markings are seen in the lungs bilaterally.   More focal
 opacities seen at the right lung base.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 Degenerative, potentially post-traumatic changes seen at the proximal right
 humerus which are incompletely visualized.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen bilaterally
 potentially due to pulmonary vascular congestion versus chronic lung disease. 
 Probable right basilar atelectasis, when amenable 2 view with better
 inspiratory effort can be performed.
