                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable, as are the hilar contours.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is no definite focal consolidation.  Slight relative increase in
 opacity over the right hemithorax as compared to the left is most likely
 technical.
