 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following chest tube removal, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema.  Basilar
 opacifications may reflect small pleural effusions with compressive
 atelectasis.
