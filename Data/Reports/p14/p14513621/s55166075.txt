                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest with contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an ill-defined opacity in the lingula and left upper lobe
 in a paramediastinal location which obscures the left heart border and is
 significantly worsened compared to ___. Another fusiform opacity in the
 right mid lung with a surgical clip projecting over the opacity which
 corresponds to a known lesion along the minor fissure seen in previous CTs. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with a left lingular and upper lobe
 pneumonia. However, superimposed recurrence of lung cancer cannot be excluded
 with this appearance and reassessment is recommended after treatment to ensure
 resolution.
