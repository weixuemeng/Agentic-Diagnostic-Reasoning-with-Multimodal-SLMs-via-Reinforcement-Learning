                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded.  Mild opacity at the right lung base is likely atelectasis
 but could represent early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 other opacity is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No
 acute osseous abnormality or displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis but could be
 early or developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
