 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.

 cm for placement at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Persistent bilateral parenchymal consolidative opacities have increased since
 the prior study, with some areas that may represent cavitaion, concerning for
 septic emboli.  No pleural effusion is identified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Worsening multifocal consolidation with possible cavitation, raising
 concern for septic emboli.
 2.  PICC terminates in the right atrium and could be retracted 4 cm for
 placement at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
