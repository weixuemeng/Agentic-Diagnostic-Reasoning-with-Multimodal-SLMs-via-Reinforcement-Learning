                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  The appearance at the right base again
 suggests a substantial volume loss with pleural effusion.  Less prominent
 changes are seen on the left.  Pulmonary vascularity is somewhat difficult to
 assess, though there does appear to be some vascular engorgement.  
 
 In view of the extensive changes, if there are appropriate clinical symptoms
 for pneumonia, this would be difficult to exclude.
