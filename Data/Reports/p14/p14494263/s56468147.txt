                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure, extubated.  Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and ___. 
 .
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right apical pneumothorax is seen with no sign of tension.  Right chest tube
 is unchanged in position from previous radiograph.  The lung volumes are
 decreased in size with bilateral atelectatic changes, unable to rule out right
 middle lobe collapse.  The cardiac silhouette is increased in size likely
 secondary to poor inspiration.  Since the prior radiograph, the ET tube and
 nasogastric line has been removed.  Left-sided PICC line with tip is unchanged
 in position in the midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right apical pneumothorax is seen with right chest tube unchanged in position.
 Decreased lung volumes with atelectatic changes, unable to rule-out right
 middle lobe collapse.
