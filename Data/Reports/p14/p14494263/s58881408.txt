  Since this morning, pulmonary edema has worsened.  This is in addition to
  multifocal consolidations consistent with pneumonia.  In the context of normal
  heart size and lack of pleural effusion, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
  should be considered, such as ARDS.  Correlate with ABG.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypoxia and fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Widespread parenchymal consolidations appear to be slightly progressed since
 the prior study, concerning for a rapidly progressing multifocal infection. 
 Additional etiology could be ARDS, with pulmonary edema being less likely,
 although a component of pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
