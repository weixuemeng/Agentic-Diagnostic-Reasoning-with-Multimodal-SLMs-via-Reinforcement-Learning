                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.  Study requested for evaluation of
 change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 interval worsening of pulmonary edema.  Increased conspicuity of opacities at
 both lung bases raises the possibility of early multifocal pneumonia, in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. Left-sided PICC line terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema with increased opacities at both lung
 bases, raising the possibility of early multifocal pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
