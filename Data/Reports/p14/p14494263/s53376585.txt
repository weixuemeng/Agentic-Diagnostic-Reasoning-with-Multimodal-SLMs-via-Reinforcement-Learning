                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-___ of one day earlier and ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Enlarged hila
 may reflect engorged vessels or enlarged lymph nodes. Widespread heterogeneous
 pulmonary opacities have worsened since the prior radiographs. There is
 apparent accompanying bronchial dilation, especially in the juxtahilar
 regions.
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal opacities are concerning for evolving
 widespread pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Differential
 diagnosis is broad and includes vasculitis, granulomatous disorders (sarcoid,
 granulomatous infection) and multifocal lung neoplasm. Direct comparison to
 older chest radiographs would be helpful to determine chronicity. In their
 absence, consider CT for more complete characterization.
