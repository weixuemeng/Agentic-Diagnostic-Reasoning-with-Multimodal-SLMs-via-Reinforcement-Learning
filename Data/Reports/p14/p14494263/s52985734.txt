                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST:  The lateral view was not repeated due to the
 patient's nausea and inability to stay sitting. Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable. Pleural thickening on the right may be due to old rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or pleural effusion.
