                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC continues to terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion and bilateral interstitial opacities suggestive of interstitial
 edema.  Additional multifocal band-like linear opacities are present in the
 central portions of the lungs, as well as a more patchy area of opacity in the
 right infrahilar region.  These findings could be due to multifocal
 atelectasis but an area of developing pneumonia in the right lower lobe should
 also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
