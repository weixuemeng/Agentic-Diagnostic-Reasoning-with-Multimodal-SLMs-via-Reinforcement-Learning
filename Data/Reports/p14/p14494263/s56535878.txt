                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral lung
 volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Linear opacification
 projecting over the left lower lung likely represents atelectasis.  Heart size
 is obscured by elevated left hemidiaphragm though appears grossly normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No linear opacification projecting over left mid-lung is new and
 of unclear etiology, possibly representing bronchial occlusion (asthma, mucoid
 plug) or due to infarct. Could be further evaluated with CT with consideration
 given to patient's renal status.
 
 ___ discussed with Dr ___ at 8:00 AM on ___ via telephone at time of
 discovery.
