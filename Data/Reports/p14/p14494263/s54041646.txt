                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Compared to the prior radiograph, there is slight enlargement of cardiac
 silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial opacities
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  This is overall similar in appearance to the
 radiograph from ___.  There is a larger patchy opacity in the right
 lower lobe which may represent a pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Findings consistent with interstitial edema. More confluent right lower lobe
 opacity, for which follow up chest radiograph after diuresis may be helpful to
 exclude right lower lobe pneumonia.
