 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, status post mini thoracotomy.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient remains
 intubated, and the right chest tube and the nasogastric tube remain in place. 
 The right lung base continues to show a relative area of basal opacity, likely
 postoperative atelectasis.  However, no pneumothorax is seen.  The minimal
 postoperative mediastinal enlargement on the right and the increased opacities
 at the left lung base have completely resolved.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is normal.
