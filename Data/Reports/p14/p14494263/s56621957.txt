                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, to assess for rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there are relatively low lung volumes, but no evidence of
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No rib
 fracture is appreciated.  If this is a serious clinical concern, special
 oblique rib views could be obtained.
