                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Placement of the new pacemaker.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker defibrillator lead terminates in the expected
 location of the right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax or apical hematoma.
 No discontinuity of the lead is demonstrated.
 
 Cardiomegaly, tortuous aorta are unchanged.  There is substantial kyphosis
 exaggerated due to multiple compression fractures of the mid low thoracic
 spine.
 
 Lung volumes are preserved.  Chronic interstitial changes are noted
 bilaterally, unchanged since the prior study.  They represent a combination of
 emphysema with some diffuse interstitial thickening and most likely bronchial
 wall thickening.  There is no pleural effusion.
