 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD and HF. New hypoxia to 2L  // Evaluate
 for edema, pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 defibrillator are unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nonspecific findings could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema with or
 without superimposed pneumonia.

 disease.
 3. Small left pleural effusion new since ___.
