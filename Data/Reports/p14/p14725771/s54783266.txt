                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with reports shortness of breathe  // ?infectious
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single lead left-sided AICD is stable in position.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Bilateral interstitial opacities
 are re- demonstrated, which may be due to underlying chronic lung disease,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, infectious process not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  As mentioned on the prior chest radiograph, nonurgent chest
 CT may be helpful to ED evaluate for interstitial lung disease.  Small left
 pleural effusion may continue to be present.
