                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of COPD and CHF with worsening
 hypoxia.  // evaluate for worsening consolidation, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination ___ at 21:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker type device again seen with single lead overlying the
 right ventricle.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Compared with the prior film, opacity at both bases is increased.  This
 appears to reflect the presence of small bilateral effusions, with associated
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Some of the lateral left mid zone  patchy
 opacity appears improved.
 
 Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar prior.  There is background
 hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  Upper zone redistribution noted.  As
 before, there are background interstitial opacities in both lungs, which could
 be due to chronic lung disease or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  However, a
 possible infectious etiology cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral foot pleural effusions are larger, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Otherwise, doubt gross change.
