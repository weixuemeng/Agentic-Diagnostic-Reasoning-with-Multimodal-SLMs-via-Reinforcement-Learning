 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute hypoxia, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in

 with moderate right mid zone consolidation consistent with pneumonia and a
 markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.  Marked degenerative
 shoulder disease.
