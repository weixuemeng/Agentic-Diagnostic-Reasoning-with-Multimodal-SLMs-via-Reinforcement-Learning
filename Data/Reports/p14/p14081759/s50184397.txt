                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Known pneumocystis pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Hyperinflation is noted with persistent
 reticular opacities projecting over the left lower lung but markedly improved
 since the prior radiographs.  Thin flowing anterior syndesmophytes are present
 throughout the thoracic spine.  This appearance has an association with
 spondyloarthropathies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
  
 1.  Improving pneumonia.
 
 2.  Thin spinal syndesmophytes suggesting the possibility of an inflammatory
 arthropathy such as could be seen with ankylosing spondylitis; clinical
 correlation is suggested.
