                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggestive of chronic pulmonary disease.  Prominence of engorged and
 ill-defined pulmonary vessels is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 pulmonary vascular congestion, though in the absence of previous images it is
 difficult to determine whether any this appearance could reflect underlying
 chronic pulmonary disease.  The possibility of supervening consolidation would
 be impossible to exclude on this single study, especially without a lateral
 view.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
