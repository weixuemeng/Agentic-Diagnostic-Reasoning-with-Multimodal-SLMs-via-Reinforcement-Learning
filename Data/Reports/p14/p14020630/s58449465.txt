 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes.  There
 is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Several surgical clips project over right upper abdomen. 
 Otherwise, the imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumothorax.  If the
 clinical suspicion for rib fractures remains, dedicated rib series may be
 obtained.
