                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms on the
 lateral view.  Bilateral interstitial opacities are compatible with pulmonary
 edema, unchanged from ___.  Retrocardiac consolidation is also
 unchanged and is likely atelectasis.  The heart remains mildly enlarged. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A large hiatal hernia is
 again noted.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, unchanged from ___. A followup
 chest radiograph after diuresis is recommended to exclude an underlying
 chronic lung disease and establish a new baseline.
