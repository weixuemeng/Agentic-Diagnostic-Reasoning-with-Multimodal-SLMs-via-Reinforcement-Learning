                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypoxemia after
 diuresis.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study from ___.
 
 There is substantial interval improvement of widespread parenchymal opacities
 which are still significant.  Giving the treatment with diuretics, the change
 most likely implicates pulmonary edema, although underlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded (although patient must be substantially sick if the
 findings represent infectious process).  Continued diuresis with re-imaging is
 recommended.  Parenchymal hemorrhage might be another possibility, but again
 with this extent of involvement hemoptysis should be observed.
 
 Given the relative sparing of subpleural areas, interstitial lung disease is
 less likely.  Atypical infectious process such as pneumocystis pneumonia might
 be considered in appropriate clinical situation.
 
 Hiatal hernia is better appreciated on the lateral view.
