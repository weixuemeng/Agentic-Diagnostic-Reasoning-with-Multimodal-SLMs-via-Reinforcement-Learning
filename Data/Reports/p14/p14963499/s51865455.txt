                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___. 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Since prior, there has been interval development of
 bilateral alveolar opacities with central distribution, somewhat sparing the
 periphery.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable
 in configuration.  Atherosclerotic calcification is noted in the aorta. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral parenchymal opacities which may represent pulmonary
 edema.  The possibility of infection should be correlated clinically. 
 Followup to resolution is suggested after treatment.
