                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of congestive heart failure, presenting
 with shortness of breath. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs demonstrate reticular interstitial opacities bilaterally with
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, and peribronchial cuffing. In
 comparison to the prior radiograph from ___ there has been dramatic
 improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema, now mild to moderate.
 Retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis, however infection is
 not excluded.
 The heart size is top-normal, improved from the prior study.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is exuberant calcification of the
 aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta. Generalized bony demineralization
 is noted, particularly of the thoracic spine, with no acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Since the prior radiograph from ___, dramatic improvement in pulmonary
 edema which is now mild to moderate and associated with pulmonary vascular
 congestion but no pleural effusion.
 2. Retrocardiac opacification, likely representing atelectasis.
