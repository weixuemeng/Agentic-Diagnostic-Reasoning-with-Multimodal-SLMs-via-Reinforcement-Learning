                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged, which accounting for differences in rotation is likely unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present without frank pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 visualized along with minimal atelectasis in the lung bases.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Left shoulder arthroplasty is
 incompletely imaged.  There are multilevel mild to moderate degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
