                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is diffusely tortuous.  On the lateral
 view, an area of confluent opacity overlies the lower thoracic spine
 anteriorly and is probably in the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Confluent opacity overlying lower thoracic spine, which may
 represent a focal area of aspiration, atelectasis or developing pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs would be helpful to document resolution and to exclude
 the possibility of a lung nodule or mass in this region.
