  2. Moderate to large left pleural effusion with loculation within the fissure
  and associated left lower lobe and lingular collapse.
  3. Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, confusion, evaluate for infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause significant bronchovascular crowding.  A moderate to
 large left pleural effusion with loculation within the fissure and associated
 left lower lobe and lingular collapse and/or consolidation.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is likely mild,
 accentuated by volume loss.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  A left pectoral single-chamber pacemaker and its leads
 project in expected location.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.
 2. Moderate to large left pleural effusion with loculation within the fissure
 and associated left lower lobe and lingular collapse and/or consolidation.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
