                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with myeloma, now with cough and shortness of
 breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Only focal pulmonary abnormality is best appreciated on the lateral view where
 there is a very small cluster of irregular opacities projecting over the
 diaphragmatic insertion of one of the major fissures.  I doubt that this is an
 acute pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mild
 fullness in the right lower paratracheal station is due to a mildly distended
 azygos vein, present since at least ___.  There is no good evidence for
 central lymph node enlargement or splenomegaly.
