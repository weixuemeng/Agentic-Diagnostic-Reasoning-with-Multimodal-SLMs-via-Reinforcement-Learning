                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:46 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with multifocal pneumonia, spiked a fever while on
 antibiotics.  Had bronchoscopy today.  Evaluate pneumonia and possible
 complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been a dramatic improvement in what was previously global pneumonia,
 perhaps interstitial.  The clearing in the upper lungs around both hila is the
 most pronounced, but even the lower lobes are much improved.  The dramatic
 change raises the question of whether it might have been a component of
 pulmonary edema or a drug reaction.  On the other hand, four days is a long
 enough interval to improve pneumonia.  Clinical correlation would be
 definitive.
 
 Heart size is normal and pleural effusion is minimal if any.  Fullness in the
 right paratracheal mediastinum is due to a chronically enlarged azygos vein
 and mediastinal fat deposition, not adenopathy.  No pneumothorax.
