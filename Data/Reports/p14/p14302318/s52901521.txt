 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are slightly
 hyperinflated but essentially clear with no evidence of new abnormalities to
 explain patient's symptoms.  Mediastinal calcified lymph nodes are noted,
 better appreciated on the lateral view.  Overall, no evidence of acute process
 that can explain patient's symptoms is seen.
