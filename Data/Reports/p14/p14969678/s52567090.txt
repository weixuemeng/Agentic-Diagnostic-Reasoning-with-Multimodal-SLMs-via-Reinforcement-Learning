                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with left lateral rib pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear.  The bones appear demineralized.  There is a mild reverse
 S-shaped curvature to the thoracic spine and mild degenerative changes.  A
 vertebral body at or near the thoracolumbar junction demonstrates a moderate
 biconcave compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of recent injury.  Biconcave moderate
 compression deformity of a thoracolumbar vertebral body, although not
 necessarily of recent chronicity; correlation with physical findings is
 suggested.
