                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, seizures  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are somewhat low however the
 lungs are clear except for apparent asymmetrical increased opacity in right
 retrocardiac region compared to the left, difficult to assess on this single
 projection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Questionable asymmetrical opacification in right
 retrocardiac region. Consider repeat PA and lateral films for further
 evaluation if clinically indicated to exclude a pneumonia in this region.
