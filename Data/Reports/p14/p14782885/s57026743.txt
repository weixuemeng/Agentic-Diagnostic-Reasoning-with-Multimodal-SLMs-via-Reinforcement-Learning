                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Ill-defined slight increase in
 density in the left base is felt to represent low lung volumes with
 overlapping vascular structures, less likely consolidation, to be clinically
 correlated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
