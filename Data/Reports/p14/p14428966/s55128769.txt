 enlarged.  Bilateral diffuse opacities are improved compared to ___,
 but again could represent mild pulmonary edema or resolving multifocal
 pneumonia.  No new opacity is present.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.

 Persistent but improved bilateral diffuse opacities, which could represent
 mild pulmonary edema or resolving multifocal pneumonia.  No new opacity.
