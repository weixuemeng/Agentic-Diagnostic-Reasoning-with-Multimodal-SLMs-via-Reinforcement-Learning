                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cardiac arrest, distended abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest and upper abdomen.  Endotracheal tube is
 seen with tip 3.5 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube seen with tip in the
 region of the gastroesophageal junction.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter seen with tip in that the RA/SVC junction.  Right-sided chest
 tube is identified.  There is no visualized pneumothorax present based on a
 supine film.  Dense retrocardiac opacity seen potentially due to combination
 of effusion, atelectasis or consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 Linear lucency in the right hemiabdomen may outline the liver edge and is
 suspicious for pneumoperitoneum.  There is a large distended loop of bowel
 which occupies the majority of the left and mid abdomen.  It is uncertain
 whether this is gastric or colonic.  Osseous structures demonstrate no acute
 abnormality noting midthoracic dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lines and tubes as above.  Left basilar opacity possibly due to combination of
 effusion and atelectasis or consolidation.  Linear lucency in the abdomen most
 suspicious for pneumoperitoneum with distended viscus in the mid to left
 abdomen.  
 
 Patient had been taken to the operating room at time of this interpretation.
