                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:28 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Emergent colectomy for volvulus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2:05 p.m.
 
 Diffuse pulmonary infiltration has worsened over the past three hours.  In the
 absence of cardiomegaly or mediastinal venous engorgement, this cannot be
 attributed to simple pulmonary edema.  Instead, diffuse alveolar damage,
 severe aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered instead. 
 Right pleural tube still in place.  No appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Previous mammoth colonic distension has been treated.  Drains
 are noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
 
 ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet, upper enteric drain ends in the lower
 esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side
 ports into the stomach.  Esophageal manometer or temperature probe is in
 place.  Left internal jugular sheath ends just above the thoracic inlet and a
 right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
