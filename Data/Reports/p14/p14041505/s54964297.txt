                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall downstairs.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  The heart size is top normal. 
 There is no concerning mediastinal widening.  The hila are unremarkable. 
 Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is likely due to a small effusion with
 atelectasis.  There are displaced fractures of right middle ribs laterally
 with local pleural or extrapleural bleeding, and fractures of indeterminate
 chronicity of left third posteriorly, and seventh and eighth ribs
 posterolaterally, also with local bleeding or pleural thickening.  There is no
 pneumothorax or layering hemothorax.  There is no focal consolidation in the
 right lung; consolidation, left lower lobe, probably atelectasis, chronicity
 indeterminate, is partially obscured by the heart.  Median sternotomy wires
 and aortic valve replacement are present.  There is no free air under the
 diaphragm. 
 
 Spine is scoliotic, but not evaluated by this study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple bilateral rib fractures, acute on the right, possibly chronic on the
 left, without pneumothorax.  Bleeding localized. Spine is scoliotic, but not
 evaluated by this study. The indication for spinal or additional chest imaging
 depends upon clinical circumstances.
