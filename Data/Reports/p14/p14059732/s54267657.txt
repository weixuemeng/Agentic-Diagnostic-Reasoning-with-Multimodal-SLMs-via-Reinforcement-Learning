 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, increased dyspnea on exertion, evaluation for
 hyperinflation and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial
 change.  The lung apices show areas of hyperlucencies, consistent with
 extensive emphysema.  In addition, the hemidiaphragms are flat, suggesting
 coexisting overinflation.  The lung parenchyma at the lung bases shows scars
 of mild-to-moderate extent, but no evidence of recent pneumonia.
 
 Unchanged hilar and mediastinal structures.  No pleural effusions.
