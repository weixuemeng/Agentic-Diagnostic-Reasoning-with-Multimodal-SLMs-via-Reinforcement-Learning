                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p EBUS with TBNA  // ? pneumothorax      ?
 pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with with study of ___, there is some re-expansion of the
 right upper lung, which in view of the previous surgery, could well represent
 the right middle lobe.  Continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour.
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is mild tortuosity of the
 aorta.  Some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels suggests the
 possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Specifically, no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.
