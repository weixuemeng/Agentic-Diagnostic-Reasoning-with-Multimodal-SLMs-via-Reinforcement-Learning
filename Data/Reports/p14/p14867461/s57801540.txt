 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, normal chest x-ray, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the preexisting left
 parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved and is barely visible on
 today's radiograph.  The scars and minimal elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm persists.  No other changes in appearance of the lung
 parenchyma.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.
