                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for eight days.
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is no definitive evidence of new
 consolidations and post-radiation and scarring changes in the left lower
 lobe/lingula and right lower lobe/right middle lobe appear to be unchanged. 
 There is no interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Questionable one area of increased opacity in the left mid lung is seen and
 might potentially reflect focal area of infection versus slightly different
 appearance of post-radiation changes in a different angle of rotation of the
 patient.  If clinically warranted, followup of the patient in four weeks after
 antibiotic therapy is recommended.
