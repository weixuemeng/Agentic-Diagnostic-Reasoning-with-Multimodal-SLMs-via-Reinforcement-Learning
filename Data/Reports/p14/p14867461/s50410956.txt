                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Surgical
 clips are present in the right mid and lower lung regions consistent with
 previous segmentectomy.  Adjacent areas of pleural and parenchymal scarring
 are present.  Recently described focal opacity in the left mid lung region
 just lateral to the inferior aspect of the left hilum appears slightly
 decreased in prominence compared to the ___ radiograph but remains
 unchanged from older radiographs such as ___.  Review of chest CT
 of ___ demonstrates evidence of post-radiation fibrosis in the
 left lung peripherally and linear scarring more centrally.
 
 No pleural effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in left mid lung opacity, of uncertain etiology. 
 Consider additional followup chest x-ray in four weeks to assess for
 resolution.  If persistent, CT may be helpful for further characterization. 
 This recommendation has been entered in the radiology communications dashboard
 on ___.
