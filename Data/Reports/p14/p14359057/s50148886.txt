                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with unconscious  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, however aspiration or pneumonia could be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting. There is a probable small left pleural effusion.
 The mediastinum appears somewhat wide, which may relate to portable supine
 technique. There is no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm from
 the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, which appears
 distended with gas. Right subclavian central venous line ends in the upper
 right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, however aspiration or
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Apparent widening of the mediastinum may relate to portable supine
 technique.
 3. Right subclavian central venous line ends in the upper right atrium and
 could be pulled back 1-2 cm for optimal position.
