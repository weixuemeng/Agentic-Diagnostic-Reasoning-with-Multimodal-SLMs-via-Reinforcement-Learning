                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Trace pleural
 effusion would be difficult to exclude, although none seen on the preceding
 abdomen/pelvis CT.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar
 contours are also stable.  No pneumothorax seen.  There is gaseous distention
 of the stomach.
