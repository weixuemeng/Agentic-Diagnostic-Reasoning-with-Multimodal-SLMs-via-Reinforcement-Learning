                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the CT
 portion of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The exam is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning. 
 Within this limitation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contour is
 stable.  Mild widening of the mediastinum is unchanged and corresponds to
 mediastinal lipomatosis on prior CT.  Again appreciated is a right-sided
 Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is noted.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute bony
 change is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes.
