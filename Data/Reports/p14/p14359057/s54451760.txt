                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated. Assess endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric
 feeding tube coursing mid line with tip out of field of view and side ports
 below the level of the diaphragm. An endotracheal tube is seen within the mid
 trachea at the level of the clavicles, 4 cm above the level of the carina in
 appropriate position. A right IJ CVL tip is seen within the lower SVC. A
 catheter is seen projecting over the left neck and is likely superficial.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities
 consistent with vascular crowding and vascular congestion. Trace right pleural
 effusion and small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Bibasilar
 atelectasis as well as a retrocardiac opacity is present. Limited assessment
 of the heart size.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Support lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Hypoinflated lungs with mild vascular congestion, bibasilar atelectasis,
 trace right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity with associated left pleural effusion is highly
 worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___ On the telephone on ___ at 1:___ PM, 5 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
