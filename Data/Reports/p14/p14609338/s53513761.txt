 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with a stable
 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal enlargement.  The diffuse bilateral but
 asymmetric airspace an interstitial process in the lungs, right greater than
 the left, is stable.  However, this does lower the ability to detect
 superimposed pneumonia.  If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging

 right.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  A descending aortic stent is
 partially visualized on the lateral projection.  Degenerative changes in the
 visualized thoracolumbar spine.
