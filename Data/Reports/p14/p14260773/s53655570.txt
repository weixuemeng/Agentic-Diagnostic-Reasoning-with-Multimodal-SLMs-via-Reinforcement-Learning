                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 A left subclavian PICC line is present and overlies the distal brachiocephalic
 vessel, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  However, in addition, there appears to be some
 volume loss on the left, with leftward deviation of the trachea.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle, loculated fluid along the lower left
 chest wall, and spiculated tenting of the left hemidiaphragm, similar to the
 earlier film.  No CHF or other focal opacities.  No gross right effusion. 
 Nipple shadows appear asymmetric, with no distinct breast shadow identified on
 the left side.  Incidental note is made of carotid artery calcification and
 some residual oral contrast.
 
 Possible minimal posterior subluxation of the sternum at the manubriosternal
 junction seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line tip over brachiocephalic vein, unchanged.
 
 2.  Small left effusion, with loculated component.  Spiculated opacity at left
 base most likely represents residual atelectatic changes, better demonstrated
 on a ___ CT scan.  However, attention to this area on followup films is
 recommended to document resolution and exclude a nodular lung mass.
