                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Corevalve  // eval for ptx s/p CT removal  
 eval for ptx s/p CT removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 729
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 12:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the chest tube with no left pneumothorax is
 appreciated. However, there is a lobulated contour to the right apex which may
 reflect a small right apical pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on
 followup imaging. The lungs demonstrate parenchymal distortion and
 hyperinflation consistent with underlying emphysema. There are small bilateral
 effusions. Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect scarring. More
 focal patchy opacity at the right base is unchanged but raises concern for
 pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis given the asymmetry. Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pulmonary edema. Status post aortic valve
 replacement with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
