                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increased shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  AP portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours again are within
 normal limits and unchanged.  There is a similar appearance to the previously
 described interstitial edema.  A loculated pleural effusion persists with left
 basilar atelectasis, although again, pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
