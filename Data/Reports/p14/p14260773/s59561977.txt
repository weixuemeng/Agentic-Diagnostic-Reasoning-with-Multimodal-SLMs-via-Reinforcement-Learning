 AP CHEST, 11:46 A.M., ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Ileostomy takedown.  Stridor earlier and now subjectively short of
 breath with expiratory wheezing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lungs are severely hyperinflated.  Previous bibasilar atelectasis, quite
 severe on the right, has entirely resolved.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Small residual bilateral pleural effusions are smaller still.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left PIC line ends in the mid left
 brachiocephalic vein.  Findings are most consistent with severe bronchospasm
 as a cause of respiratory insufficiency.  The larynx and subglottic trachea
 are not evaluated by this study.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 dictation.
