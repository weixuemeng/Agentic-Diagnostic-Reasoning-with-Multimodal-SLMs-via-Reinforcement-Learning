                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ?MVC*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same
 last name!  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, and CT of the torso
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding, but the
 appearance of the lungs is otherwise unremarkable for supine positioning. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
