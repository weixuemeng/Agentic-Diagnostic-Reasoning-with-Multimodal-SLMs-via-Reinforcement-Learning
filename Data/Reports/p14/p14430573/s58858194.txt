                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cholangitis.  Preop for surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, but there is no pulmonary edema.  Heavy pleural
 thickening involves the fissures and some of the costal pleural surfaces, but
 there is no effusion or definite calcification.  Enlargement of the right
 hilus could be due to vascular dilatation or, less likely, lymphadenopathy.
