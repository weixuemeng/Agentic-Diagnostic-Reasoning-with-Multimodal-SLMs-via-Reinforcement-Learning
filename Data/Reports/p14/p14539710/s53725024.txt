                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left PTX s/p 2 chest tubes  // Eval for
 interval change in left PTX, perform at ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study,extensive left-sided subcutaneous emphysema
 about the left chest and about the lower neck is again seen.
 
 Also again seen are the left-sided chest tube and left pigtail catheter.
 Though these appear unchanged in configuration, note is made that the curved
 portion of pigtail is centered on the chest wall and the proximal sideport of
 the left chest tube may lie outside the chest wall.  Clinical correlation is
 requested.
 
 On the current film, there is a small left apical pneumothorax.  There is also
 probably some pneumothorax air deep to the medial side of the left lung. 
 Lucency along the left border of the heart is more apparent.
 
 The right lung is similar on the prior film, with a small right apical
 pneumothorax and band like opacity along the minor fissure, suggesting a small
 amount of fluid in the minor fissure.  No other right-sided pneumothorax is
 detected, though a subtle occult pneumothorax might not be apparent.
 
 Mild represent a redistribution is unchanged.  Aside from minimal atelectasis
 at the left lung base, there is no focal opacity no focal parenchymal opacity.
 No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest and pigtail catheter, as described, though unchanged in alignment. 
 Clinical correlation requested.
 
 Biapical pneumothoraces.  Suspect a small amount of pneumothorax air along the
 medial side of the left lung.  Lucency along the left heart border also
 slightly increased, possibly related to projection from medial sided
 pneumothorax.
 
  If clinically indicated, CT could help to more completely delineate the
 presence of pneumothoraces, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema in the
 position of the chest tube and pigtail catheter.
