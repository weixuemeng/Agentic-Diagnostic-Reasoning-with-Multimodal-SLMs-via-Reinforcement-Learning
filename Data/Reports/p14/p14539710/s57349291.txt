                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothoax  // ?interval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Again seen is a left chest tube and left-sided pigtail catheter, similar in
 configuration.  Also again seen is considerable left-sided subcutaneous
 emphysema.  No gross left-sided pneumothorax is detected.
 
 However, linear air is seen in close proximity there the aorta and cardiac
 border raising the question of a small amount of pneumothorax air along the
 medial side of the lung versus a small pneumomediastinum.  The cardiac
 silhouette itself is grossly unchanged.
 
 2 small metallic densities overlie the cardiac silhouette --  these appear to
 correspond to endobronchial valves seen in left lower lobe bronchi on the CT
 from ___.
 
 Minimal increased retrocardiac density could reflect atelectasis.  No gross
 left effusion.
 
 Again seen is relative lucency at the right lung base, which likely reflects
 emphysematous change.  No convincing right-sided pneumothorax.  Minimal
 platelike atelectasis again seen in the right mid zone, but no frank
 infiltrate.
 No right-sided effusion.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Thin vertical linear lucency along the left heart border could represent
 either a small left-sided pneumothorax along the medial side of the lung or
 possibly new small amount of mediastinal air.  Clinical correlation is
 requested.
 
 Otherwise, no obvious left-sided pneumothorax, but a tiny apical pneumothorax
 may be difficult to detect due to overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Minimally increased retrocardiac density could reflect atelectasis.
 
 Subtle metallic densities overlying left heart border could represent
 endobronchial valves  seen in left lower lobe bronchi on ___ CT
 scan.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings related to thin vertical lucencies at the left heart
 border --___ small medial sided left lung pneumothorax versus new small
 amount of mediastinal air --___ discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___,
 the covering intern, by telephone ___ min after discovery at 16:28 on ___
