                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent pneumothoraces s/p chest tubes,
 weaning suction  // Interval change? Pneumothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier today
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left chest tube and pleural pigtail catheter are again present. Several of
 the pigtail catheter sideholes appear to be external to the pleural space and
 correlation is recommended.  There is persisting and extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema along the left chest wall and neck.
 
 No discrete pneumothorax is identified.  Since the prior exam the lucencies
 overlying the mediastinum or less conspicuous and attention on follow-up
 imaging is recommended.  Unchanged platelike atelectasis in the right midlung
 zone and left lung base.  The size the cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No discrete pneumothorax identified.
 
 2. The lucencies previously described overlying the mediastinum are less
 conspicuous and close attention on follow-up imaging is recommended to assess
 for pneumomediastinum.
 
 3. Several of the left pleural pigtail catheter sideholes appear to be
 external to the pleural space.  Clinical correlation as to the pigtail
 catheters placement is recommended.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 persists.
