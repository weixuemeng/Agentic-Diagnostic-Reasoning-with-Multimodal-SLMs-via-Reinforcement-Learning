                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left pneumothorax status post pigtail placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 08:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with pigtail
 formed along the periphery of the left mid lung field.  Previously noted large
 pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size with improved aeration of the
 atelectatic left lung.  Previously noted mild rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures has nearly completely resolved.  The right lung remains
 emphysematous and hyperinflated.  No pleural effusion or new focal
 consolidation is demonstrated.  Heart size is normal.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the left lateral chest,
 new in the interval, related to chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with mild interval decrease in
 size of the large pneumothorax and partial re-expansion of the left lung. 
 Previously noted contralateral mediastinal shift has resolved.
