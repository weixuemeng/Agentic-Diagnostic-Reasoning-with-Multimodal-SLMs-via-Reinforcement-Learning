 medication and fluid. now with increased oxygen requirement  // eval for pulm

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Dobbhoff tube extends at least to the mid portion of the stomach were
 crosses the lower margin of the image.  There are low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectatic changes and small pleural effusions. Cardiac silhouette
 is prominent and there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some loss of volume in the left
 lower lobe.
 There is a right PICC line in place. The tip is difficult to see, though it
 probably is in the mid portion of the SVC.
