                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, chills and chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is moderately enlarged, increased compared to prior
 examination.  There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is consolidation of the right lung base with
 posterior correlate on lateral view compatible with right lower lobe
 pneumonia.  There is associated small right-sided effusion.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A metallic stent projects over
 the abdomen on lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation of the posterior basal segment of the right lower
 lobe compatible with pneumonia with likely associated small pleural effusion. 
 Recommend follow-up to resolution.
