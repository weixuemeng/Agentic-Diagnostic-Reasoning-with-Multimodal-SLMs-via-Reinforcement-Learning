                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic right chest pain.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear
 lungs with no evidence of infiltrate.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal aside from prominence of the right mediastinal contour which is
 likely ascending aorta but in a patient with known malignancy, is concerning
 for possible lymphadenopathy.  No pleural abnormality is detected. 
 Interposition of colon between the right hemidiaphragm and liver is seen. The
 patient is status post left nephrectomy with surgical clips in the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mediastinal fullness which may be concerning for
 lymphadenopathy in a patient with known malignancy. Recommend CT to further
 evaluate mediastinum.
