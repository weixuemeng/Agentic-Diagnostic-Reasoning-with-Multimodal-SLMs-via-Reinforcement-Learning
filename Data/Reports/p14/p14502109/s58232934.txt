                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history consolidation/PNA ___  //
 assess for clearing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph, there has been almost complete resolution
 of the right upper lobe opacity. There are still some faint residual areas of
 minimal linear opacification which probably reflects residual fibrotic healing
 of the involved lung parenchyma.
 
 There are no new areas of focal consolidation. There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolved right upper lobe pneumonia. Minimal residual fibrotic healing of
 affected lung parenchyma.
