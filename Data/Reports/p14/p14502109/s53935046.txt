                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. CT Chest ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen in the right upper lung is a linear airspace opacity, decreased in
 conspicuity in comparison to chest x-ray from ___.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Decreased conspicuity of right upper lung linear airspace opacity as seen
 on numerous prior studies, better assessed on prior chest CT, possibly
 reflective of recurrent chronic pneumonitis.
 2. Otherwise, clear lungs without focal consolidation.
