                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest / back pain on the right
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Waxing and waning opacification
 is noted within the right upper lobe in a region of previous scarring,
 currently appearing worse in the interval.  Left lung is clear. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Waxing and waning opacification in the right upper lobe in a region of
 scarring, currently worse in the interval. This may reflect pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting, but a recurrent chronic pneumonitis such as from
 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia may be present.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest can be obtained for further assessment.
