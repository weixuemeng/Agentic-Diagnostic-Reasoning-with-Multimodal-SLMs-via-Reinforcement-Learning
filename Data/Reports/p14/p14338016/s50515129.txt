                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic respiratory failure  // progression
 of pulmonary findings
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the film in overlying the upper fundus.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.
 
 Again seen are extensive interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs,
 more confluent in the right lung.  No significant change is detected, allowing
 for technical differences.  No gross effusion.
