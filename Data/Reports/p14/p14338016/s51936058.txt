 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p intubation  // ett placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP portable views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 10:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 5.1 cm
 above the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, finally
 terminating in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the
 stomach.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, right significantly greater
 than the left, are re- demonstrated, as seen on the prior study.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen although small pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude on the left.
