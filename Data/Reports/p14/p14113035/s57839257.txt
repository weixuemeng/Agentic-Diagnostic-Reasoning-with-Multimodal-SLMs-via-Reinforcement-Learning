 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with drowning, intubated  // eval ett, aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An orogastric tube is seen coiled within the hypopharynx, and an endotracheal
 tube is noted terminating approximately 3.1 cm above the level of the carina.
 There are airspace opacities involving the perihilar regions bilaterally,
 moreso on the left, with vascular indistinctness. No evidence of overt volume
 loss, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.  The stomach is noted to be distended with
 air.

 asymmetric pulmonary edema/ARDS. Differential diagnostic considerations
 include aspiration, hemorrhage, or infection.
 2. ETT noted in the appropriate position.
 3.  Orogastric tube coiled within the hypopharynx.
