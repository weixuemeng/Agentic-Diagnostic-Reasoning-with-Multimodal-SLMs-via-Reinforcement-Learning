                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right lateral rib pain.  Patient with recent motor vehicle collision
 and right-sided broken ribs and sternum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Two days earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  There
 is perhaps vague callus about the right anterior fifth and sixth ribs, which
 may relate to the given history of recent subacute injury, but no lucencies or
 displaced fractures are identified.  Small osteophytes are present throughout
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  No evidence of displaced rib
 fracture; equivocal callus along the right anterior fifth and sixth ribs.
