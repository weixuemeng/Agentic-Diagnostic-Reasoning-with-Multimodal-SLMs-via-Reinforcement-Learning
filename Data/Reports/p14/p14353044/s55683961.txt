                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, effusions. 
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is background hyperinflation consistent with COPD.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 diffuse hazy opacity in the right lung -- allowing for differences in
 technique, this is likely unchanged compared with earlier the same day. 
 Probable bulla in the right perihilar region.  Minimal atelectasis or scarring
 at the left lung base.  The left lung is appears prominently hyperlucent --
 overall, allowing for technical differences, the appearance is similar to
 ___ on the left and this appearance may be accentuated by opacity on the
 right side.  
 
 Subclavian catheter terminates in the region of the SVC/RA junction.  No
 pneumothorax detected.Incompletely imaged thoracic spinal stabilization
 hardware noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right effusion and hazy opacity in right lung, with right
 base collapse and/or consolidation.
