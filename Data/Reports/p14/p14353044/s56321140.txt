                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pressure and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CTA ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A left subclavian central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the SVC.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits, with mild aortic arch calcifications.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis is most pronounced in the lung bases.  Hazy focal opacity is noted
 at the confluence of the left first anterior rib with the left fifth posterior
 rib, which appears unchanged, and no discrete nodular opacity was seen on the
 prior CTA of the chest from ___.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures, with unchanged posterior fusion hardware in the thoracic spine
 spanning two adjacent compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
