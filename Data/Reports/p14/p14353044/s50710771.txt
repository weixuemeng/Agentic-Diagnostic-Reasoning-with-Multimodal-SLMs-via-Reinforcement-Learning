 Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Atelectasis

 the right hemidiaphragm is chronic with lateralization of the diaphragmatic
 apex, likely attributable to the presence of a small subpulmonic effusion. No
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Diffuse
 gaseous distention of bowel loops are seen in the upper abdomen.  Posterior
 fixation hardware is noted within the thoracic spine with re- demonstration of
 diffuse osteopenia and multiple compression deformities.
