                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable upright view of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is new right lung base opacity compatible
 with at least some component of pleural effusion with probable underlying
 airspace disease.  The left lung remains essentially clear, noting mild
 scarring versus atelectasis at the lung base.  Left subclavian central line is
 seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Posterior spinal fixation hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity in part due to pleural effusion with
 possible underlying airspace disease.
