 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion with residual
 small effusion remaining.  Adjacent atelectasis in the right mid and lower
 lung has improved with residual linear atelectasis remaining.  Minimal linear
 atelectasis is also present in the left lower lobe.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are identified to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
