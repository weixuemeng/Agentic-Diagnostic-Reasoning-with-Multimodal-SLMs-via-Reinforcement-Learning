                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M with a history of testicular cancer with lung metastasis
 s/p chemotherapy   surgery in the ___, who had been doing well, but
 presented to his PCP earlier today with 2 weeks of increasing dyspnea on
 exertion, and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion on CXR. 
 // Improvement to effusion. PLEASE DO AT ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chain sutures are noted overlying the peripheral left lung and right lung base
 consistent with known history of prior lung sections. A right pigtail pleural
 catheter appears unchanged in position.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Previously seen opacity at the
 right mid to lower lung appears unchanged compared to prior study and likely
 represents atelectasis however a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged
 compared to prior radiograph from earlier the same day.  There is persistent
 fluid tracking within the pleura along the right lateral chest.  Small right
 apical pneumothorax is unchanged compared to study earlier the same day.
 
 Multiple postsurgical clips are noted in the mid abdomen
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right pleural effusion, unchanged compared to prior study.
 2. Small right apical pneumothorax, unchanged compared to prior study.
 3. Right lower lung opacity, unchanged compared to multiple priors, likely
 represents atelectasis, however a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
