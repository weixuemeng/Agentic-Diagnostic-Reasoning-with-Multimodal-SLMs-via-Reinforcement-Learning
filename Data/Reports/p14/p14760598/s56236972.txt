  Mild decrease in the size of a still very large right pleural effusion
  associated with compressive atelectasis status-post right chest pigtail
  catheter placement.  No pneumothorax.  Contour of the pigtail catheter appears
  somewhat abnormal, raising the possibility of a kink.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new Rt effusion  // PTX? Residual fluid?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a pigtail right chest tube, projecting
 over the inferolateral right chest, with overlap of the pigtail with the
 distal catheter, raising potential concern for kink.  Correlate clinically for
 drainage.  There is slight decrease in overall size of the right pleural
 effusion with minimal residual aeration of the right upper lobe. No
 pneumothorax.  Suture in the left lung again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
