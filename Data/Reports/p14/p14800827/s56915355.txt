                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are
 noted in the lung bases, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific and likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
