                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cardiac arrest  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ETT has been placed which extends into the region of the carina and should
 be retracted for better positioning.  Cardiac size is enlarged even given the
 AP view. Hazy area of opacity in the right upper hemi thorax and left lower
 lobe is compatible with pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube in the region of the carina and should be retracted for better
 positioning. Right upper lobe opacity and left lower lobe is compatible with
 pulmonary edema, less likely pneumonia given the patient's presentation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:
 Subsequent exam was already performed which shows the ETT in appropriate
 position.
