                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pain, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is massive
 hyperinflation of both lungs with large bullae present within lower lungs,
 right more than the left.  There is no sign of pneumothorax, or definite signs
 of pneumonia.  Blunting of the CP angles bilaterally on the lateral projection
 could reflect the massive hyperinflation though the possibility of effusion is
 also raised.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears tubular though this is
 expected due to the significant degree of underlying emphysema/COPD.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe bullous emphysema.  Possible small bilateral effusions. 
 No evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
