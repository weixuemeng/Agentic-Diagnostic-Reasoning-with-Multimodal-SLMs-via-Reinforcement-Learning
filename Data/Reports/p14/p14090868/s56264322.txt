                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with shortness of breath x1
 week.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate intact sternal wires.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged.  Lungs are fairly well-expanded.  There is
 indistinctness at the left heart border, which is likely related to
 atelectasis.  However, an early developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite focal consolidation.  Indistinctness at the left heart border is
 likely due to atelectasis.  However, an early developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the right clinical setting.
