                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural thickening on recent shoulder film.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of acute pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  There is asymmetric opacification
 in the right apical region as seen on previous shoulder film.  This was not
 definitely seen on the previous examination or the CT of ___.
 
 The appearance could merely reflect apical changes related to previous
 tuberculous disease that was not definitely appreciated on the previous study.
 However, the possibility of a developing neoplasm in this region would be
 difficult to exclude.  An apical lordotic view would be of value to better
 characterize this region.  Comparison with an interval study since the ___
 chest radiograph would also be extremely helpful.
 
 If uncertainty remains as to the etiology of this appearance, CT may be
 necessary.
