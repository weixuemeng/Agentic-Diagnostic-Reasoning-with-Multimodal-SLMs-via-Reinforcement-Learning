                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are extremely low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 pulmonary vasculature.  Given low lung volumes, there remains central
 pulmonary vascular congestion without interstitial edema. Heart size is likely
 normal given AP projection and slightly lordotic positioning. Hazy bibasilar
 opacities could represent atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude
 in the correct clinical setting. . Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, difficult to exclude infection in
 the correct clinical circumstance.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without
 frank interstitial edema.
