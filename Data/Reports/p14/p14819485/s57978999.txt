                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Mild hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding
 of the pulmonary vasculature is likely due to low lung volumes. There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are seen within the lung bases, which
 may reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but infection is not
 completely excluded. Consider repeat exam when the patient is able to take a
 deeper inspiratory effort.
