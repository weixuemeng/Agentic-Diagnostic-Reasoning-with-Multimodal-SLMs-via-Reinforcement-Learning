                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea, recent admission for pneumonia 
 // Please eval for worsening of pneumonia, other cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. There is
 blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace
 pleural effusion. Previously noted subtle right apical opacity is less
 conspicuous than on the prior study. This lateral left basilar
 atelectasis/scarring, similar to prior. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and mild basilar atelectasis. Blunting of the posterior left
 costophrenic angle may be due to a trace pleural effusion.
 
 Previously noted subtle right apical opacity is less conspicuous than on the
 prior study. Apical lordotic view may be helpful in further assessing this
 location.
