  1. ET tube terminating 1.3 cm above the carina.  Recommend retraction by 1.3
  cm for safe positioning in lower trachea.
  2. Enteric tube with distal tip projecting over the gastric body.  Side-port
  distal to the GE junction.
  3. Possible lower lobe peribronchial cuffing/bronchial wall thickening,
  suggestive of small airways disease.  No focal lung consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with an NG tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is seen terminating 1.3 cm above the carina.  Recommend retraction
 by at least 1.3- 1.5 cm for safe positioning in the lower trachea.  An enteric
 tube courses inferiorly and projects over the approximate location of the
 stomach.  The distal side-port projects 4 cm distal to the GE junction. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  .  There is no focal
 lung consolidation.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminating 1.3 cm above the carina.  Recommend retraction by 1.3
 cm for safe positioning in lower trachea.
 2. Enteric tube with distal tip projecting over the gastric body.  Side-port

 3. No focal lung consolidation.
