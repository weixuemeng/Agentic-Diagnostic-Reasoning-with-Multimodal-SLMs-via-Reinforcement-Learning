 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a large hiatal hernia
 continues to be seen.  The right chest tube is in situ.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The minimal remnant pleural effusion and the very small remnant
 basilar opacities at the right lung bases are constant in appearance.  There
 is no evidence of a left pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema or pulmonary infection.
