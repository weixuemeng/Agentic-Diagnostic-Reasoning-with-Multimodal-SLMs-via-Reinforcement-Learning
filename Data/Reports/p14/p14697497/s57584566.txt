                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with stage IV lung cancer, complaining
 of acute shortness of breath with increased oxygen requirements.  Evaluate for
 interval change from prior chest examination, any pleural effusions, increased
 fluid concerns for pulmonary embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single portable chest examination with patient in semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the frontal view of the next preceding PA
 and lateral chest examination.  The right-sided rather massive pleural
 effusion may have increased slightly even when paying attention to possible
 changes in patient's position.  Right lower lung area obscured by the pleural
 effusion.  There are some scattered infiltrates in the left lung base,
 probably plate atelectasis.  There is no evidence of left-sided pleural
 effusion as the lateral pleural sinus remains free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possibly increased right-sided pleural effusion identified on
 single AP portable chest view.  This examination cannot be expected to answer
 questions posed as there are no previous chest examinations available for
 comparison, the proper diagnosis will require a chest CT.
