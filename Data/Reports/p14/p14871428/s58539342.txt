                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable supine AP view of the chest.  This study is severely
 limited due to overpenetration.  Within that limitation, there is no obvious
 pneumothorax, consolidation, or effusion.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: Severely limited study due to overpenetration.  No obvious acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
