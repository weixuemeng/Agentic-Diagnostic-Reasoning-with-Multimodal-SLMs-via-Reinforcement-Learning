                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and left-sided rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP VIEW AND LATERAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again
 redemonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle posteriorly is compatible with a small pleural effusion, with resolution
 of previously noted small right pleural effusion.  Mild atelectatic changes
 are noted at the lung bases.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased small left pleural effusion, and resolution of
 previously noted right-sided pleural effusion.  No radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.
