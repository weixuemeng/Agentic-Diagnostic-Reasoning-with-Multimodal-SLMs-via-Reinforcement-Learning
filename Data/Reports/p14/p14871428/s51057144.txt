                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of left-sided chest tube, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Focal atelectasis is present along the chest tube site as well
 as a persistent small left pleural effusion.  Postoperative appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal contours is unchanged.  Overall appearance of the chest is
 relatively similar to the prior study except for some improvement in degree of
 bibasilar atelectasis.
