                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with overdose, question aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are seen.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen potentially due to
 atelectasis noting that aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  The lungs
 superiorly are clear, were not obscured by overlying leads.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis given low lung
 volumes, noting that aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
