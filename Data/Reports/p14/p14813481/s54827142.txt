                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV lymphoma on chemotherapy with fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again noted is a right-sided port with the catheter tip in the mid SVC.  The
 lungs are clear with no evidence of focal opacity.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal structures are stable.  No
 acute fractures identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  It is worth noting that if clinical
 suspicion for an atypical infection is high, CT is the more sensitive
 modality.
