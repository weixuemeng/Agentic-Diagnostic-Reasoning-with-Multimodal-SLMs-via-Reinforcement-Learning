                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Retrocardiac opacity with air-fluid levels consistent with a large hiatal
 hernia.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified. 
 No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  There may be some biapical scarring.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs with evidence of biapical scarring, which
 most likely relate to COPD.  Large hiatal hernia.  No focal consolidation.
