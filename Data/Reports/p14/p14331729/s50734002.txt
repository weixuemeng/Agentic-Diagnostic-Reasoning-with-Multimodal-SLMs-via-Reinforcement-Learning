 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an

 course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tube tip projects over the
 mid parts of the stomach, the sidehole is located at the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The lung volumes remain unchanged.  There is borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.  The double-lumen
 right-sided venous catheter is unchanged.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No
 larger pleural effusions.
