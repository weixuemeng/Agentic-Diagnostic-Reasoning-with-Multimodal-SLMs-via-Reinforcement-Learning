                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post abdominal wall washout, evaluation for endotracheal
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has
 been removed.  The patient has been intubated, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube projects at the upper level of the clavicles, approximately 5 cm from the
 carina.  Tube could be advanced by 1 to 2 cm.  The double-lumen catheter on
 the right and the left PICC line remain unchanged.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  After abdominal wall washout, there is
 unchanged evidence of a small left pleural effusion as well as of a
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  The right lung is unremarkable.  There is no safe
 evidence of free intra-abdominal air on this supine radiograph.
