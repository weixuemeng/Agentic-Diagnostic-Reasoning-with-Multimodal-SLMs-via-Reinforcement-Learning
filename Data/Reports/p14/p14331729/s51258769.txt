                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are extremely low lung volumes which may account for much of
 the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar
 opacification, more prominent on the left, is consistent with some combination
 of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  
 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, though they could merely be a manifestation of the low lung
 volumes.
