                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated, with Klebsiella pneumonia.  Study
 requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided HD line now terminates in the mid SVC and left PICC
 line terminates in the upper-to-mid SVC.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  An enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. A right
 central venous catheter has been removed. Lower lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures. Heterogenous opacity of the left lung base is
 insufficiently evaluated due to overlying external devices. Mild atelectasis
 of the right lung base is essentially unchanged. No definite pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided HD line now terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 2.  Heterogenous opacity of the left lung base is incompletely evaluated due
 to overlying external devices.  If clinical concern, repeat chest radiograph
 is recommended with the intent of a good inspiratory effort, with patient in a
 sitting position and with clearance of overlying external devices.
