 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the central opacities suggested
 previously have essentially cleared.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal
 limits.  There is increasing opacification at the right base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm.  Although this could merely represent atelectasis and pleural
 effusion, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia would have to be considered.  Mild atelectatic changes
 are seen at the left base.
