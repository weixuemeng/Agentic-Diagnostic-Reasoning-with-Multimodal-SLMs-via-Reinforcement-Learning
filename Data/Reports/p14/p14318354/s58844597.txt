                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lethargy, fatigue, and altered mental status, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct with new patchy
 opacification, predominantly in the bilateral lung bases, which likely reflect
 a combination of subsegmental atelectasis and mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  There is increased retrocardiac opacification.  Small pleural
 effusions cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  Note is again made of calcification at the aortic knob.
 An ovoid metallic object again projects at the right lung base along the right
 cardiac border, unchanged from the prior study. A metallic coil is noted in
 the periphery of the right lung base, which is also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, increased from ___.  
 2.  Increased retrocardiac opacification could represent atelectasis; however,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
