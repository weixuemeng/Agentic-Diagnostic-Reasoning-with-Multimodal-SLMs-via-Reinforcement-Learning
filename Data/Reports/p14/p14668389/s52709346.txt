                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Previously identified left mid lung zone opacity has
 cleared.  There is however new left basilar opacity which projects over the
 retrocardiac region on the lateral view.  Given lower lung volume on the
 current exam particularly on the lateral this could be due to atelectasis
 however developing infiltrate is not excluded.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view
 likely localizing to the left.  This could represent atelectasis given lower
 lung volume however developing consolidation from infection could be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
