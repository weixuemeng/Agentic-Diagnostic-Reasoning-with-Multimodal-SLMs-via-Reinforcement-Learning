                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory distress, severe interstitial lung disease.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Diffuse lung opacities have minimally improved, consistent with improvement in
 acute exacerbation of either : interstitial lung disease, infection, pulmonary
 edema or hemorrhage.  This is superimposed to a chronic diffuse interstitial
 lung disease.  The lung volumes are low.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
