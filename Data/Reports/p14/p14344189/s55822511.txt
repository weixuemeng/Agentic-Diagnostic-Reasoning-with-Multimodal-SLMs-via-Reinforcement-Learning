                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of BOOP, increasing hypoxia and
 leukocytosis of 14.1
 
 COMPARISONL  CT chest from ___ at 12:38.
 
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, AP:  Lung volumes are low.  There are abnormal prominent
 interstitial markings with a peripheral and basilar predominance, compatible
 with organizing pneumonia.  There are new bibasilar opacities with discoid
 morphology in the left lower lobe, and rounded morphology in the right lower
 lobe that partially silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is top normal.  There are no significant pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increased interstitial markings, correlating with the history of
 organizing pneumonia.
 
 2.  Increased bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or potentially
 infection.
