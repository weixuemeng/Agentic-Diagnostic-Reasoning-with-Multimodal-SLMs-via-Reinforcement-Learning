 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory failure status post intubation.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip
 sits ___ cm above the carina.  Endogastric tube courses inferiorly with its
 side port well below the GE junction.  A right-sided PICC tip terminates at
 the lower SVC.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Diffuse airspace opacities are present, as well as an underlying interstitial
 process; these opcacities are subtly increased in the left upper lung.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
