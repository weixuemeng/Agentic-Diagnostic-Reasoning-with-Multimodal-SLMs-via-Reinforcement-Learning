 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 4:05 PM
  IMPRESSION:  Diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities which worsened from
  ___ to ___, but improved from ___ to present; the differential diagnosis
  includes pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, and interstitial fibrosis;
  correlate with the treatment that brought on the improvement in appearance.
 PFI VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:37 AM
  PFI:  Diffuse lung opacities compatible with chronic fibrotic lung disease;
  bibasilar atelectasis and probable small bilateral pleural effusions;
  detection of more subtle pneumonia or edema is limited by the appearance of
  the lungs.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening interstitial lung disease and
 worsening dyspnea.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and multiple chest radiographs
 from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable and within normal limits.
 The lungs continue to demonstrate diffuse airspace and intersitial opacities,
 which show a worsening trend from ___ to ___, but then show improvement
 from ___ to present.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles as well as subtle
 obscuring of the hemidiaphragms suggests some degree of bibasilar atelectasis
 and small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities which worsened from
 ___ to ___, but improved from ___ to present; the differential diagnosis
 includes pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, and interstitial fibrosis;
 correlate with the treatment that brought on the improvement in appearance.
