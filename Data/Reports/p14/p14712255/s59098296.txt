                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:05 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with rib fractures.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:04 p.m.:
 
 Large heart and large tortuous thoracic aorta are chronic.  Lungs are clear of
 any focal abnormality.  I see no pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is more pronounced now than
 earlier.  This is sometimes an indication of developing pneumothorax but may
 relate instead to removal of the right pleural tube.
