                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, no definite pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Central catheter remains in place.  Subcutaneous gas is again
 seen along the right lateral chest wall.
 
 The severe tortuosity of the aorta and substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists.  In the absence of vascular congestion, this raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
