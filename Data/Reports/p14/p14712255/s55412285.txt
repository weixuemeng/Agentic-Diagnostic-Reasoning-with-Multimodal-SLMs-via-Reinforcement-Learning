                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia status post
 single-chamber ICD placement, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall is
 stable.  There is interval placement of a left pectoral single-chamber ICD
 with a right ventricular ICD lead terminating in the right ventricular apex. 
 The course of the lead is unremarkable.  The inspiratory lung volumes remain
 low.  Retrocardiac opacification and bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted on the lateral view, which are
 likely little changed from prior frontal chest radiograph.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains severely enlarged.  The thoracic
 aorta is dilated and tortuous, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Status post ICD placement with single lead in appropriate position.  No
 pneumothorax.  
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Stable right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
