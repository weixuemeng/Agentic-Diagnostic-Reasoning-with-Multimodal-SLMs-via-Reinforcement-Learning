                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size allowing for AP technique. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  An area of increased opacity overlies the
 spine on the lateral view, and could be located within either or both
 posterior basilar segments of the lower lobes, as there are also subtle areas
 of opacity in the retrocardiac regions bilaterally on the frontal view.  Small
 pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine, which may
 represent aspiration, atelectasis or developing pneumonia in one or both
 posterior basilar segments of the lower lobes.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
