                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Febrile neutropenia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The central venous line tip is at the level of proximal right atrium.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for
 minimal linear atelectasis at the left lower lung, most likely in the lingula.
 No consolidations to explain patient's symptoms demonstrated.  The right upper
 lung nodular opacity projecting at the level of the right hilus is
 redemonstrated, and overall appears unchanged or minimally decreased since
 ___, although comparison with the CT from ___ is
 difficult due to difficulty in comparing the two modalities.
 
 There is no pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
