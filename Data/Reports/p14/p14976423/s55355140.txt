  Chest tube and central line are unchanged. Right basal opacity is mildly
  increased though lung volumes are lower (which also results in bronchovascular
  crowding). No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  Leukemia, status post transplant, now with effusions and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is some mild increase in the right basilar
 opacity, some of which could reflect vascular crowding in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  Right chest tube remains in place and there is no definite
 pneumothorax.
