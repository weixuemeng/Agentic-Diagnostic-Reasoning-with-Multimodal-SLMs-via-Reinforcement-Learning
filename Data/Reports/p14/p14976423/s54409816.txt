                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain associated with rigors.  Assess for aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made with prior CT torso from ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung
 volumes.  Right central catheter tip is in the right atrium as before.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  A small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis.  Right perihilar linear
 atelectasis is unchanged.
