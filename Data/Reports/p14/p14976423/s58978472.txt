                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ALL, crackles, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  A right-sided line is present,
 tip over right atrium.  Allowing for technique, heart size is borderline, but
 not frankly enlarged.  There is no CHF, frank consolidation or effusion. 
 There is minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid zone and some atelectasis
 at both bases.  Compared with ___, no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Scattered atelectasis.  No frank consolidation.  No definite
 change compared with ___.  In this clinical setting, an early infiltrate
 could be subtle radiographically.  If clinical suspicion for a pneumonic
 infiltrate remains high, then further assessment with PA and lateral chest
 x-rays would be recommended.
