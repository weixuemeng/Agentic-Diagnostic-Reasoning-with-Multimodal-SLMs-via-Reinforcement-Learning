                                 FINAL REPORT
 POTABLE AP CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 7:13 A.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aspergillosis pneumonia, presents with right MCA
 stroke.  Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 20:23.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 7:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  A right chest tube and right
 triple-lumen central venous line are unchanged in position.  There is a stable
 right apicolateral pneumothorax.  Lung volumes have slightly decreased and
 there continues to be patchy opacity at the right base which may reflect a
 combination of post-procedural changes and/or atelectasis, although an early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Left lung remains grossly clear.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  Results
 were communicated by phone on ___ at 8:34 am to the patient's nurse,
 ___, and the resident, ___, at the time of discovery.
