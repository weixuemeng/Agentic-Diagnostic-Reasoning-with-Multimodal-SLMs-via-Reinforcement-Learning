                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 08:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CVA with right frontal IPH, SDH, and
 SAH now with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___, at 07:13.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 08:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which appears to have its tip
 projected over the stomach, and the side port just below the gastroesophageal
 junction.  A right dual-lumen central venous catheter is unchanged in
 position.  A right basilar pigtail pleural catheter is unchanged in position. 
 There has been interval decrease in size of a right apical lateral
 pneumothorax.  Left lung remains grossly clear, although the left costophrenic
 angle is not entirely included on this study.  The right lung continues to
 show a patchy opacity at the right base, which may represent post-procedural
 contusion, residual atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
