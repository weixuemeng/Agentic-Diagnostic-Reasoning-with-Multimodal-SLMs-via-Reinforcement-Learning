                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right perihilar pneumonia, now treated, evaluate for
 change.
 
 Subtle opacity seen in the right mid zone on the prior chest x-ray is
 resolving consistent with effective treatment of pneumonia.
 
 The position of the central line is unchanged.  Elsewhere, the lung fields are
 clear.
