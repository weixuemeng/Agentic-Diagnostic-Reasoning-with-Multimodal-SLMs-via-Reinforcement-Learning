                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Loculated right effusion status post thoracoscopy and chest tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recent dated ___ in
 correlation with chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior CT examination, a loculated right pleural
 effusion has essentially been drained.  There are two new right-sided chest
 tubes, which enter the same level with one positioned inferiorly and one
 continuing superiorly.  There is now a new trace right apical pneumothorax. 
 Lung volumes remain low with no new focal consolidation.  A right subclavian
 catheter is unchanged with tip in the right atrium.  A nasogastric tube is
 normal in course with tip in the stomach and side port near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval drainage of loculated right pleural effusion with placement of
 chest tubes and trace new right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Overall unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma with no new focal
 consolidation.
 3.  Esophageal catheter with tip in stomach and side port near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  If desired, this may be advanced to ensure side
 port within the stomach.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 1:45 p.m., ___.
