                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest tubes, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT, ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged small
 right pleural effusion, with no residual appreciable pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect combination of loculated pleural fluid and
 atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A
 right central venous catheter tip is located at the cavoatrial junction.  Two
 chest tubes are unchanged within the right chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Loculated right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis, with
 two pleural catheters remaining in place.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax.
