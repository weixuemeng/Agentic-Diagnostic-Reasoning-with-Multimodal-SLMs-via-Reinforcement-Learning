                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement after lung biopsy complicated by pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a right
 chest tube in place.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.  The area of
 increased opacification at the right base is quite ill defined at this time,
 possibly reflecting some post-procedure bleeding.
