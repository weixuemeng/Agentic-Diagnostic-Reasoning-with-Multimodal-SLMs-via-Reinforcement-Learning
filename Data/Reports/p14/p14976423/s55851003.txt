                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:44 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumothorax and effusion.  Evaluate chest tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has worsened.  Moderate right pleural effusion, with
 posterior lateral and fissural components is larger.  I would be surprised if
 the small drainage catheter were able to access fluid so widely distributed in
 the pleural space.  No pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly stable.
