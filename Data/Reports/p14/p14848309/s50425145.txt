                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and fever  // Question pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Despite this, there is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or overt
 pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect a small
 pleural effusion versus atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
