                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.3 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Low lung volumes are present.  Heart
 size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely
 atelectasis.
