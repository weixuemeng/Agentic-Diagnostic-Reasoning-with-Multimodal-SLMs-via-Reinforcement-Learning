                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with HIV with left-sided
 rib pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Precise assessment of the left field of
 view is a separate study in the corresponding report, but note is made that
 there are most likely present old rib fractures on the left, but no acute
 injury is seen within the limitations of the chest radiograph technique.
