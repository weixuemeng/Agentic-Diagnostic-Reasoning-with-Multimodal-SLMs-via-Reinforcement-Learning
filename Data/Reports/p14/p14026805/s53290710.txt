                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Since prior, there has been interval resolution of the
 perihilar and bibasilar interstitial edema.  The lungs are now clear without
 large confluent consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in
 configuration when compared to prior.  Leftward tracheal deviation at the
 thoracic inlet is again noted, likely somewhat accentuated due to technique
 and positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of the pulmonary vascular congestion since
 prior.  Stable cardiomegaly.
