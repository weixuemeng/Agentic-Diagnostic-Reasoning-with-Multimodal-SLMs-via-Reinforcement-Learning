                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with self-inflicted stab wound to chest with
 pneumothorax.  Now chest tube removed.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to most recent prior radiograph of the chest
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate unchanged left
 basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, with left pleural effusion and stable
 cardiac size.  The mediastinum again appears wide, as before, and the left
 mediastinal fullness may indicate fluid accumulation.  No new focal opacities
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  At the level of the left hilus, the
 contour of the descending aorta is not well seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  No significant change since prior study. 
 However, left mediastinal fullness and relative obliteration of the contour of
 the aorta at the level of the left hilus warrants followup CT scan to
 establish baseline evaluation of the mediastinum.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 3:20 p.m., within five minutes of discovery.
