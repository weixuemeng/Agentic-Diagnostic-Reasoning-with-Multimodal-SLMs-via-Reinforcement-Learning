                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tubes pulled.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:56 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior radiograph, there has been interval removal
 of left chest tube and right internal jugular catheter.  The sternal wires are
 unchanged in appearance.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There has been improvement in the right basilar opacity with
 persistence of left basilar opacity which likely represents atelectasis.  Lung
 volumes are unchanged. Of note, there is mild increase in the caliber of the
 left mediastinum with two separate densisities along the left heart border,
 possibly indicating fluid accumulationg in the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax. Left mediastinal fullness which may indicate
 fluid accumuation. Recommend close radiographic follow up or CT scan to
 establish baseline evaluation of the mediastinum.
