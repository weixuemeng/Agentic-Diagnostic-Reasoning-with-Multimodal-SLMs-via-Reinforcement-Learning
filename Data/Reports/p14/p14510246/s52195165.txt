                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wound to the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are low in
 volume, which gives the appearance of bronchovascular crowding, but are
 otherwise clear without pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified. 
 
 While mediastinal widening and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette may
 reflect low lung volumes and supine/AP technique, in the setting of possible
 traumatic injury to the mediastinum, CT should be obtained to assess bleeding.
 
 This was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ in person at ___ on
 ___, who advised the patient was being directly taken to the operating
 room.
