                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with lower back pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote prior radiographs from ___ and CT of the
 cervical spine from earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  The upper mediastinum is widened, particularly to the right of midline
 along the right paratracheal stripe, new since the remote prior study.  There
 is moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The lungs appear clear aside
 from a calcified nodular focus projecting over the left lung base, which is
 unchanged and suggestive of a granuloma.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 The bones appear demineralized.  In addition to a moderate-to-severe
 thoracolumbar compression deformity that was already present on the remote
 prior examination, there is a new moderate superior endplate compression
 deformity in the immediately superior vertebral body, although not necessarily
 recent.  There is also probably a chronic mild superior endplate compression
 deformity along the mid thoracic vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease or injury.  However,
 there is new lobular widening of the mediastinum.  The uppermost part of the
 mediastinum is visible on a CT of the cervical spine from earlier on the same
 day, suggesting that this appearance may be due to mediastinal fat and
 tortuosity of great vessels, but widening is new.  Evaluation with chest CT is
 recommended in follow-up to exclude etiologies such as aneursym or
 lymphadenopathy, however.
