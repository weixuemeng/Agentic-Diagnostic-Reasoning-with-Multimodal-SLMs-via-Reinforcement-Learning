 Right lung is clearing, but there is greater vascular congestion in the left
 upper lobe than before, and there may be a component of re-distribution due to
 patient positioning, particularly if patient is intermittently left decubitus.
 Wide cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially stable.  ET tube tip is now
 less than 5 cm from the carina, in standard placement.  Left subclavian line
