                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Decreased oxygen saturation, questionable mucus plug.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no changes seen in
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette, the right hemithorax with its
 atelectasis and moderate pleural effusion as well as of the tracheostomy tube.
 On the left, there is an increase in radiodensity, caused by slightly enlarged
 pulmonary vessels, suggesting moderate fluid overload.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
