                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presenting with EKG changes.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is new
 mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.  The more focal opacity at the left base
 likely represents atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The mediastinal contours are widened, though unchanged from the prior exam. 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Sternal wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild to moderate pulmonary edema with probable retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
