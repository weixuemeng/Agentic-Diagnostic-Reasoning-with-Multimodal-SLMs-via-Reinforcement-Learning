                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with post-traumatic left upper chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Low lung volumes on frontal view slightly exaggerate
 heart size.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No acute fracture
 is detected, although chest radiographs have limited sensitivity for rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  If
 there is clinical concern for a rib fracture, dedicated rib radiographs are
 recommended.
