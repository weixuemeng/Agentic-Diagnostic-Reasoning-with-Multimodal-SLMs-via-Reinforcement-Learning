                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 spiculated opacity measuring approximately 1.7 x 1.5 cm in the right
 suprahilar region, concerning for underlying pulmonary lesion versus vascular
 structures.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy.  The aorta is coarsely calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Spiculated opacity in the right suprahilar region raises concern
 for underlying pulmonary lesion.  Recommend followup chest CT for further
 evaluation.
