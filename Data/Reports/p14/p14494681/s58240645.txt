                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and weakness
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, and
 chest CT from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse increased density at the lung bases
 is likely secondary to overlying soft tissue attenuation.  The lung apices are
 clear.  No definite consolidation is identified on the lateral view.  There is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  Apparent enlargement of cardiomediastinal contours
 may be secondary to the AP technique.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to patient body habitus, though no
 definite pneumonia.
