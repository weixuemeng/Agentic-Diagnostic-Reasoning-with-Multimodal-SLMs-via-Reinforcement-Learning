   NG tube can only be followed to the level of the carina.  Distal tip is
  indistinct.  A linear density may be coursing toward the right of midline -
  raising concern for NG positioning in the right main stem bronchus
  particularly given the clinical history.  Recommend repositioning and re-
  imaging to re-evaluate line position. ___ d/w Dr. ___ at 12:22 am on

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Desaturation, acute change in mental status, assess lines
 and tubes.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 The evaluation of the NG tube is very limited given technique and patient body
 habitus.  The tip is not clearly visualized.  The tube can be followed to the
 distal esophagus.  Consider repeat radiograph for better evaluation.  Right IJ
 catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  Bibasilar atelectasis have increased,
 larger on the right side.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small.  ET tube is in standard position.  There is no evident pneumothorax.
