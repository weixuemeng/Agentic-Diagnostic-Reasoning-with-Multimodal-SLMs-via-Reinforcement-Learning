                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with intubation, evaluate for tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 Evaluation of the radiograph is limited due to poor photon penetration. 
 Within these limitations, the lungs are low in volume and show subtle
 retrocardiac lower lobe opacity.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  An ET tube terminates
 at the carina and should be withdrawn by at least 3 cm for optimal position. 
 An NG tube passes out of view below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity could represent sequalae of aspiration or
 atelectasis.  Low lying endotracheal tube terminates at the carina should be
 withdrawn by 3 cm for optimal position.
 
 These findings were communicated to ___ MD via telephone at 11:02
 pm on ___.
