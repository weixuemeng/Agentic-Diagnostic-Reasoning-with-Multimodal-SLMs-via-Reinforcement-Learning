                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post recent internal jugular line
 placement and ET tube repositioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 22:22 and chest CT from
 ___ at 22:56.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube has been
 repositioned, with the tip terminating 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. 
 A new right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. 
 No pneumothorax is evident.  Increasing interstitial opacities suggest
 developing pulmonary edema especially given the moderate cardiomegaly and
 distension of the azygous vein.  No large pleural effusions are evident. 
 Consolidation within the left lung base has progressed, possibly due to
 progressive atelectasis, though pneumonia and aspiration are also within the
 differential.  Apparent widening of the Mediastinal and hilar contours is
 likely secondary to the supine technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Proximal repositioning of the endotracheal tube now in optimal position.
 2.  Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line
 terminating in the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Progressive left lower lobe consolidation, possibly increasing
 atelectasis, though pneumonia and aspiration remain within the differential.
 4.  Developing mild pulmonary edema
