                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and bradycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to a patient's large body habitus.  Moderate to
 severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion. 
 Ill-defined opacity at the left costophrenic angle appears to persist when
 compared to the prior study, and is nonspecific.  No definite new focal
 consolidation is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to large body habitus.  Unchanged indistinct opacity
 projecting over the left costophrenic angle, possibly atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.
