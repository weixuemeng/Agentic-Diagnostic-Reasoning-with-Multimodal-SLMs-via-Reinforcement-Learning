                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob calcifications are again seen. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right PICC tip appears to terminate in
 the SVC.  Assessment of the lung bases is limited due to underpenetration. 
 There appears to be a retrocardiac opacity as seen on the prior study, likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right are likely present.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, with
 probable small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
