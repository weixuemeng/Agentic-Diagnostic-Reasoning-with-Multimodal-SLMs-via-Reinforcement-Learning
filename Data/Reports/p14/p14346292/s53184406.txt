 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right apical granuloma is

 aorta and top-normal heart size.  Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips
 are noted. Surgical clips in the left neck are new.  There is a small lucency
 projecting under the right hemidiaphragm which is concerning for free
 intraperitoneal air.

 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Lucency projecting under the right hemidiaphragm may represent
 intraperitoneal free air.  Recommend clinical correlation and abdominal
 radiographs for further evaluation.
