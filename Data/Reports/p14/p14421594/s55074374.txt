                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, concern for pneumonia based on productive cough
 and malaise/weakness.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unchanged cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Again seen are reticular interstitial markings diffusely throughout
 the lungs, which likely represent chronic lung disease.  Unchanged hazy
 opacity in left lung base, likely representing pleural scarring or thickening.
 Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  There are mild multilevel degenerative changes. 
 Mid thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change in diffuse reticular and interstitial markings, likely
 representing chronic lung disease.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
