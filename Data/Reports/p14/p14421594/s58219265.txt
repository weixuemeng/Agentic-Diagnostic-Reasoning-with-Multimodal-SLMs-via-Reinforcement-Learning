                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears borderline enlarged, likely accentuated due to low lung
 volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature
 is normal. Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities likely atelectasis.
