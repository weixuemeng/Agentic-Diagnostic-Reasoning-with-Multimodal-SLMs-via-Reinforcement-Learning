                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated postop eval for pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  There are
 low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, no overt CHF, focal infiltrate or
 effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  Compared with the trauma chest x-ray, spinal rods and screws are
 now seen over the lower thoracic spine extending caudally beyond the inferior
 edge of this film.  Skin ___ also overlie the midline.  An ovoid density
 overlying left thoracic inlet likely lies outside the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No CHF.
