                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:33 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Again seen is an ET tube, with tip at the level
 of the mid clavicles, approximately 5.1 cm above the carina;  mild pulmonary
 vascular plethora, likely accentuated by the low lung volumes; and bibasilar
 atelectasis, also likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No left-sided
 effusion.  Right costophrenic angle and lower right chest wall excluded from
 the film.  Spinal hardware and skin ___ noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change.
