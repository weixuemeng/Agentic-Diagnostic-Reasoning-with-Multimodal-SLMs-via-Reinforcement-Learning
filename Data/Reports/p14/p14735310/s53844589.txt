                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no interval change.
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no acute focal
 pneumonia or pleural effusion.  Mild hyperexpansion is again consistent with
 some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
 
 Specifically, no evidence of congestive failure.
