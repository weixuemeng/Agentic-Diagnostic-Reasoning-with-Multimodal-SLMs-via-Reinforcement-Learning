                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of diabetes and right-sided chest pain.  Now with cough
 and bibasilar crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest, ___.  CT torso, ___.  Chest
 radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest
 radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest show bibasilar coarse reticular
 opacities which were seen previously in the prior CT from ___. 
 These opacities are intermittently present in prior studies, and most likely
 represent an atypical appearance of pulmonary edema.  Also on the differential
 is intermittent environmental or medication exposures causing intersitial
 reaction.  There is no consolidations.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The hila and the cardiomediastinal silhouette are normal in
 shape and contour.  There are mild degenerative changes with flowing anterior
 osteophytes in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bibasilar reticular opacities which have been present
 sporadically on previous radiographs likely represent atypical pulmonary
 edema, alternative reaction to periodic environmental or medication exposure.
 
 Results were communicated with Dr. ___ at 1:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___.
