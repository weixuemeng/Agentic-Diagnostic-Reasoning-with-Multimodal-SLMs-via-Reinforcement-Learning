                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with sarcoid, status post recent course
 of steroid treatment.  Assess for any improvement since chest examination of
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examinations of ___ and ___.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic
 aorta stable.  No new contour abnormalities identified.  Mediastinal
 structures unremarkable.  The previously identified bilateral fullness of the
 hilar regions as well as the markedly increased interstitial structures in
 both lungs has now undergone marked improvement.  Whereas comparison between
 the previous examinations of ___ and ___ could not demonstrate a
 conclusive improvement, the present examination shows almost complete
 normalization of the previously increased interstitial markings.  Also
 fullness of the hilar regions observed and commented upon previously has
 clearly regressed.  No evidence of new abnormalities.  No signs of pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax in the apical area.  Review of chest CT of
 ___ illustrated well, the at that time rather advanced
 interstitial and peripheral parenchymally seen nodular densities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of diffuse sarcoid changes seen on PA and
 lateral chest examination during the latest six-month examination interval.
