                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CAD, immunocompromised patient.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities, located in the right upper lobe and at both lung bases,
 have increased in severity and extent.  Given that the lung volumes have not
 changed in the interval, the findings are strongly suggestive of pneumonia, as
 stated in the previous report.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Status post
 valvular replacement and sternotomy.  Unchanged appearance of the mediastinal
 structures.  No pneumothorax.
