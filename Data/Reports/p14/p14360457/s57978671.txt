                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is widening of the right upper
 mediastinal contour which may reflect venous distention and less likely lymph
 node enlargement.  Heart is mildly enlarged and has increased in size since
 the prior study.  The right upper lobe opacities are also seen.  Perihilar
 vascular congestion is noted as well as bilateral interstitial opacities.
 Multifocal patchy air space opacities are also demonstrated in the right upper
 lobe and both lower lobes. There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  There has been prior median sternotomy and CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar and right upper lung opacities, new since prior, which may represent
 asymmetrical edema in the setting of cardiomegaly but coexisting infection
 should be considered. Short term follow-up radiographs are recommended to
 ensure resolution and to exclude a component of underlying chronic lung
 disease.
