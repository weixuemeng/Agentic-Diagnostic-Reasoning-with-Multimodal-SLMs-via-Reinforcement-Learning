                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 Since the recent chest radiograph, the patient has undergone removal of lower
 sternal wires and sternal closure with two transverse plates now in place
 overlying the mid and lower sternal regions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable compared to the previous radiograph, and right PICC remains in standard
 position.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as patchy and
 linear bibasilar atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but
 small right pleural effusion has improved.
