 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluation for atelectasis or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes have increased, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Areas of mild atelectasis at both lung
 bases, left more than right, persist.  Moderate cardiomegaly without current
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  The alignment of the sternal
 wires is constant.
