                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath after recent hospital admission and cardiac
 catheterization.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  Opacification within the medial left
 upper lobe appears more consolidated when compared to the prior chest
 radiograph, but appears relatively unchanged compared to the CT from ___ and is compatible with the patient's known lung mass with adjacent
 radiation fibrosis.  Scarring within the right lung apex is stable. 
 Emphysematous changes are again noted.  No new areas of focal consolidation
 are seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Compression deformities of the T11 and T4
 vertebral bodies are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new areas of opacification identified to indicate pneumonia. 
 Left upper lobe consolidative opacity compatible with the patient's known lung
 mass with adjacent radiation fibrosis.
