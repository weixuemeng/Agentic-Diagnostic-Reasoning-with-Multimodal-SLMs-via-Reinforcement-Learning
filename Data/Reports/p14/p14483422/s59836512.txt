                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain, lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT, ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Left upper lobe mass is redemonstrated, and
 right upper lobe ill-defined opacity appears relatively unchanged compared to
 prior chest CT, but is more pronounced when compared to the prior chest
 radiograph.  Emphysematous changes are again noted. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Unchanged left upper lobe mass compatible with known cancer, with ill-defined
 opacity in the right upper lobe likely corresponding to the subpleural
 opacities seen on prior chest CT.  This finding, however, appears more
 pronounced when compared to the prior chest radiograph. No new abnormality
 otherwise identified.
