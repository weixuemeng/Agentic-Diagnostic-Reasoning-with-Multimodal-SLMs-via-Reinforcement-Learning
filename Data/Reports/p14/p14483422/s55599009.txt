                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a prior CT torso
 dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer, status post fall, assess for
 rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is a left
 paramediastinal mass which is better assessed on the prior CT, compatible with
 known primary lung cancer.  The lungs are otherwise clear, though changes from
 known emphysema are noted.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Overall
 cardiomediastinal contour appears unchanged from prior CT.  Bony structures
 are intact.  Of note, no displaced rib fractures are seen.  A wedge deformity
 of the upper thoracic spine is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mediastinal prominence compatible with known left
 paramediastinal mass.  Emphysema.  No acute injury is seen. Please refer to
 subsequent CT chest for additional details.
