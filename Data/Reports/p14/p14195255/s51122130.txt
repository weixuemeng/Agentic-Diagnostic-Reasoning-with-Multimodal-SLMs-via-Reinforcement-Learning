                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with EKG changes during stress test.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are nodular
 opacities projecting over the lungs bilaterally, specifically in the right mid
 lung and left mid-to-upper lung.  On the lateral view, these may be seen
 anteriorly.  They could potentially represent calcified pleural plaques,
 especially given suggestion of focal calcified pleural plaque along the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Additional calcification seen in the region of the AP window,
 compatible with calcified node.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral nodular opacities.  While these could be related to
 underlying calcified pleural plaques, dedicated, nonurgent chest CT is
 suggested to confirm and exclude an underlying lung lesion.  No definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
