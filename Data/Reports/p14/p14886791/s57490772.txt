                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 5:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube
 position.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 5:42.
 
 A portable AP semi-upright chest film on ___ at 5:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  The patient is status post mediastinotomy for
 CABG with stable moderate cardiac enlargement.  Calcification of the aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  Overall, there has been interval improvement
 in aeration at the right base, likely reflecting resolving atelectasis.  There
 continues to be some pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  Biapical calcifications are likely pleural in
 etiology.  No pneumothorax.
