                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:42.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old small apical pneumothorax on the right
 following IJ placement at outside hospital, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 5:20 a.m.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5:42, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  The heart remains enlarged with a left ventricular
 prominence.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified on the current study.  Endotracheal tube continues to have
 its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  
 
 There may be some cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity consistent with
 pulmonary venous hypertension, although no overt pulmonary edema.  Lung
 volumes are slightly lower and there is patchy opacity at the right base which
 most likely reflects patchy atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Calcification of the
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
