                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Overdose on Seroquel, intubated at OSH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable frontal image of the chest. 
 
 ET tube is in adequate positions.  NG tube passes into the stomach, but distal
 tip not included on the image.  The lungs are well expanded.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen, likely representing atelectasis but cannot exclude
 pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration, vs less likely
 infection given clinical history.
