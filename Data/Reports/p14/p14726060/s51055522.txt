                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  
 
 Low lung volumes again accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There
 is continued opacification at the bases consistent with a combination of
 pleural fluid and atelectatic change.  Especially at the right base, there is
 some coalescence of opacification which, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 would raise the possibility of supervening pneumonia.
