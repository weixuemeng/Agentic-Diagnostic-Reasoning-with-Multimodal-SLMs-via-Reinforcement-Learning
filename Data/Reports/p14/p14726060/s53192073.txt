                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, mild bibasilar atelectasis.
