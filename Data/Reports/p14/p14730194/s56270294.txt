                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis with respiratory
 depression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube ends 5.7 cm above the
 carina.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Moderate
 pulmonary edema is similar on the right but increased on the left, now more
 symmetric. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.  No
 pneumothorax.  Vascular stents in the right brachiocephalic and SVC are again
 seen.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Increased osseous density is likely
 related to renal osteodystrophy.
