                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Films from earlier the same day at 4:21 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been placed.  The tip is approximately 4.5 cm
 from the carina.  Enteric tube is seen passing below the inferior field of
 view.  Vascular stent again noted in the right brachiocephalic vein/SVC
 region.  Degree of cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged
 given differences in positioning and inspiratory volume.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle may be due to superimposed effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of ET and NG tubes as above, otherwise no
 change.
