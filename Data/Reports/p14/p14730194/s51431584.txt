                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is limited due to low lung volumes.  The heart size is at least
 moderately enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to
 low lung volumes.  Vascular stents are noted in the region of the right
 brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures
 with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Rugger ___ appearance to the spine is compatible with renal
 osteodystrophy.  Focal kyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction with severe
 compression deformity is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  If there is continued concern for
 infection, a repeat exam with improved inspiratory effort to better assess the
 lung bases is recommended.
 
 3. Renal osteodystrophy with severe compression deformity at the thoracolumbar
 junction with focal kyphosis.
