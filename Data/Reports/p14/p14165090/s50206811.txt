                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  Subtle basilar opacities may be due to atelectasis without
 definite focal consolidation seen.  Relative lucency of the upper lungs may
 relate to underlying pulmonary emphysema.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are also
 stable.  There may be minimal vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest COPD.  Possible minimal vascular congestion.  No
 definite focal consolidation; although if there is concern for such, dedicated
 PA and lateral views would provide better evaluation.
