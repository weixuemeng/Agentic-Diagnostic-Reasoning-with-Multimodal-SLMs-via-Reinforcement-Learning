                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Consolidation and pulmonary edema.  Patient with known cirrhosis,
 cough, and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are well expanded.  Bilateral perihilar and lower lung
 haziness with obscuring the bronchovascular markings, prominent bilateral hila
 and mild cardiomegaly suggests pulmonary vascular congestion is likely from
 the volume  overload given the clinical setting.  No discrete lung opacities
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion.
