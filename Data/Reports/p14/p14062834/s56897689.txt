                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion and liver failure, please evaluate for
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ and ___ and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is relatively unchanged compared to next preceding study with
 stable low lung volumes and streaky opacities in the bibasilar lungs. 
 Opacities likely reflect atelectasis particularly given stability compared to
 ___, though an early infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Stable right mid lung pleural thickening with adjacent linear
 opacitiy correlating with area of scarring on ___ chest CT. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  No osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable bibasilar and right mid-lung opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis and scarring, though infection is not entirely excluded.
