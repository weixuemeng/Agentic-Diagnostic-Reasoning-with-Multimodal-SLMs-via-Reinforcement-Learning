                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CTA chest, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Ill-defined patchy opacities are noted in both lung bases, findings which may
 be reflective of atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 Focal area of pleural thickening is noted within the right mid lateral
 hemithorax.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases which
 may reflect atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded.
