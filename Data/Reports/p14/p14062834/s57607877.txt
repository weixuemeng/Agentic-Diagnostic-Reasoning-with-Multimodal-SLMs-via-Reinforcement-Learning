 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 Comparison radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The tips of the costophrenic angles
 are excluded from the study.  The heart size is top normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar atelectasis is
 present. Slight focal right upper zone pleural thickening is unchanged, likely
 reflecting mild scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
