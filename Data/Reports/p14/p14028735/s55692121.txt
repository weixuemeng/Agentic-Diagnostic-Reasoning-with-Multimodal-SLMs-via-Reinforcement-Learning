                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain and ST depressions in lateral leads.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 There is no pulmonary edema. Crowding of the bronchovascular structure is
 noted as result of the low lung volumes. There is minimal atelectasis at the
 lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
