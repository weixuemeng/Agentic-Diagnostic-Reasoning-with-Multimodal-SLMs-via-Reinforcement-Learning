                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Faint opacity in
 the periphery of the left lower is likely atelectasis, or may be due to
 overlying soft tissue.  The right lung is clear without focal consolidation. 
 No evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  A circular device is
 identified overlying the left mid chest, likely related to history of left
 breast cancer, post mastectomy.  Surgical clips in the left axilla are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Faint opacity in the periphery of the left lower lung is likely
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Post left mastectomy with surgical clips in the left axilla and a circular
 device overlying the left chest.
 
 3.  The right lung is clear.
