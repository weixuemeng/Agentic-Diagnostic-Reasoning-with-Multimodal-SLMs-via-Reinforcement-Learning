                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Widened mediastinum is consistent with an aortic
 aneurysm, better seen in concurrent CT.  Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
 There is almost collapse of the left lower lobe.  Right lower lobe atelectases
 are small. Left mid lung opacities could correspond to aspiration.
