                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with abdominal pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are compatible with prior
 CABG surgery.  The heart size is within normal limits.  Marked dextroscoliosis
 of the thoracic spine limits fine assessment of the mediastinal and hilar
 contours, which appear to be grossly normal.  The lung volumes are low, but
 clear of consolidation.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no subdiaphragmatic free air; gas projecting over the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen is within the hepatic flexure of the colon.  A
 compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine is at least a year old.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-CABG changes and scoliosis, but no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process or subdiaphragmatic free air.
