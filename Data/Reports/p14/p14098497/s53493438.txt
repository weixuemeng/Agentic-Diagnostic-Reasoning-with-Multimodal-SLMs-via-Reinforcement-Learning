                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 moderate multilevel degenerative changes noted in the lower thoracic spine. 
 Deformity of the left proximal humerus is compatible with a remote fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.
