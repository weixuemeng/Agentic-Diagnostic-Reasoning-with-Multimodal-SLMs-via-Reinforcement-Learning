  ETT terminates 5.2 cm above the carina.  Left pleural tube terminates in
  medial position.  R subclavian cath terminates at the confluence of the right
  subclavian vv and SVC, not definitely a central catheter.  Previously seen
  traumatic herniation of the stomach through the diaphragm is no longer seen
  and enteric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  Small left lung base opacity
  could represent atelectasis or hemorrhage.  Small left chest wall subq
  emphysema. -EAhn ___WET READ VERSION #1

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.  Status post chest tube placement on the left.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  A right subclavian introducer
 catheter has been placed, which terminates probably at the level of the
 confluence of right internal jugular and subclavian veins.  A left-sided chest
 tube has also been placed.  Lucency projecting over the left lower chest is
 stable and perception of a possible pneumothorax is likely artifactual.  A
 left lower mediastinal contour abnormality has been reduced.  An orogastric
 tube courses into the left upper quadrant, its full course not visualized. 
 Streaky left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for a contusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post reduction of a diaphragmatic hernia and placement of
 chest tube.  Placement of right-sided venous catheter.  On this study, left
 anterior sixth and seventh and eighth rib fractures are much better
 illustrated.
