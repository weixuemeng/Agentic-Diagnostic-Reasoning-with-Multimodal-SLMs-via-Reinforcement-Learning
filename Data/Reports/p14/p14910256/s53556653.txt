                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple injuries, pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the left subclavian vein
 catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes have decreased, causing vascular
 and interstitial crowding at the lung bases.  There is no evidence of focal
 increase in lung density, as expected for pneumonia.  A minimal diffuse
 increase in radiodensity of the right lung is due to patient position. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
