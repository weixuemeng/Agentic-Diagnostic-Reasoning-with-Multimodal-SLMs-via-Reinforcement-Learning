                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided chest tube in place, status post
 diaphragmatic rupture repair.  Question interval change in fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube and enteric
 tube to be in standard position.  A left transthoracic chest tube is similar
 in configuration as compared to prior exam, with maried angulation superiorly,
 and possible obstruction as correlated with prior CT dated ___.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There may be trace
 lucency along the left heart boarder, which could represent air related to a
 small anterior pneumothorax or small pneumopericardium, not significantly
 changed since prior exam.  The lungs are low in volume but clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or confluent consolidation.  
 
 A nondisplaced left lower rib fracture is better delineated on prior CT dated
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Sharply angulated left chest tube with possible obstruction as correlated
 with prior CT dated ___.
 
 2. Trace linear lucency along left heart boarder likely represents a small
 residual anterior pneumothorax, versus less likely small pneumopericardium,
 but similar to one day prior.
