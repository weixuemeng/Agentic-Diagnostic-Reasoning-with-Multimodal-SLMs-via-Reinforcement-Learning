                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tube remains in place.  Previously evident
 pneumothorax at the left apex is no longer visualized, but there remains an
 unusually sharp delineation of the left cardiomediastinal contour, which could
 potentially represent a small residual anteromedial pneumothorax on this side.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved in the interval.  Moderate gastric
 distention is noted in the imaged upper abdomen.
