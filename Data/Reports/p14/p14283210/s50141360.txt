                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male smoker with shortness of breath, chest pain, and
 productive cough for 24 hours.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent chest CTA
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are hyperexpanded, findings
 consistent with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  However,
 there is increased consolidation within the right lung base which correlates
 with opacities on concurrent chest CT concerning for pneumonia.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base are also increased and may represent infection
 or possibly subsegmental atelectasis.  Mild mediastinal widening corresponds
 with adenopathy seen on concurrent chest CT.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild generalized vascular engorgement is present, though the
 heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar consolidations, right greater than left, likely pneumonia.
 
 2.  Mild mediastinal widening corresponding with adenopathy seen on recent CT.
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
