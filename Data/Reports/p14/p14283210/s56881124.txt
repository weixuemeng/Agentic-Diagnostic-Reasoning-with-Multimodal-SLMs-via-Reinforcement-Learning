                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath; evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an interval
 increase in opacity in the right lower lung, without air bronchograms to
 signal consolidation.  A small nodular opacity overlying the left third
 posterior rib was not present on Chest CTA on ___. Emphysema is severe,
 and a cluster of ring shadows in the right apex are bullae with thickened
 walls. Heart size is normal, peripheral and hilar pulmonary vessels are not
 engorged, and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Severe emphysema. 
 
 2.  Interval increase in the right basilar opacity, unlikely to be pneumonia,
 could be aspiration.
 
 3.  Recommend repeat CXR in 1 month for acutely developed left apical nodule,
 primarily to evaluate possible infection.
