                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:08 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, right internal jugular line ends in the low
 SVC and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. 
 Consolidation in the lower lobes has improved slightly since early on ___, but not detectably since consistent with pneumonia.  Previous mild
 pulmonary edema is improving.  Emphysema is severe.  Heart is mildly enlarged.
 No appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax on this supine
 chest radiograph, which would make detection of early pleural abnormalities
 difficult.
