 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, right lower lobe pneumonia, evaluation of
 interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 which could indicate developing pleural effusion.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
