                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis and pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient might have
 developed a minimal left pleural effusion.  The pre-existing opacities on the
 left are largely less extensive than on the previous image.  Otherwise, there
 is no relevant change, including the constant position of the monitoring and
 support devices.
