                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the
 development of extensive opacification involving much of the right lung in
 addition to the previously described apparent left loculated fluid collection.
 In view of the clinical history, the findings are consistent with widespread
 pneumonia.  Some component of supervening vascular congestion would have to be
 considered.
