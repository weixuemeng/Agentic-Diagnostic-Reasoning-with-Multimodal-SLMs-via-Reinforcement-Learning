                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy and subsequent intubation, here to
 evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 09:48 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube is in place with the tip 3 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip in the
 stomach.  A dual-lumen central catheter in the right IJ is unchanged with the
 tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC.  A left-sided chest tube is unchanged. 
 Lucency projecting over the left lung base likely corresponds to the small
 left apical pneumothorax seen on the prior study which was performed in the
 semi-erect position.  The right lung demonstrates no pneumothorax.  No
 significant pleural effusion is seen.  There is no new consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small left basilar pneumothorax on this supine view.
 2.  ET tube 3 cm above the carina.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 16:55 on ___.
