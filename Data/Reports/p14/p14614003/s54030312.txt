                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax due to
 polytrauma on the left with chest tube discontinued and pigtail in place.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 As compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier, there is minimal
 additional increase in the basal component of pneumothorax, but slight
 interval decrease in the apical component, that might reflect redistribution
 of the air.  Subcutaneous air appears to be unchanged.  The pigtail catheter
 is unchanged.
