                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___; CT ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A semi-upright frontal view of the chest was
 obtained portably.  The patient has been extubated with interval removal of
 the upper enteric tube.  A right dialysis catheter ends in the superior right
 atrium. 
 
 Mild opacity at the right lung base is slightly improved and may be
 atelectasis or aspiration. Linear opacity at the left lung base is likely
 atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 mediastinal silhouette are normal.
