                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Polytrauma and substantial mucous secretions.
 
 Current AP radiograph demonstrate newly developed left lower lobe collapse. 
 The pneumothorax is not as well seen, potentially obscured by the collapsed
 left lower lobe, although new opacity along the medial aspect of the
 mediastinum might reflect redistribution of the left pneumothorax.  The tubes
 and lines are in unchanged position.  The fracture of the left scapula can be
 partially seen.
