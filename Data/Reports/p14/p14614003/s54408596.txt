                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma, now difficulty weaning from ventilator.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 5.4 cm above the carina.  Left jugular line is in upper SVC and
 right-sided jugular line is in lower SVC.  Right lower lung collapse with
 adjacent small pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is, however, new
 opacification in the left lower lung which could represent atelectasis,
 aspiration or beginning of pneumonia.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  New left lower lung opacities which could represent atelectasis,
 aspiration or early pneumonia.  
 
 The results have been discussed with the medical team.
