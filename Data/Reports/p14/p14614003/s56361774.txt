                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with polytrauma and
 Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube tip is projecting over the left upper quadrant, potentially
 within the stomach.  Bibasal atelectasis and pleural effusions are noted. 
 There is questionable deep sulcus sign that might reflect left pneumothorax,
 repeated dedicated radiograph of the chest is recommended.  The rest of the
 tubes and lines are in appropriate position.
