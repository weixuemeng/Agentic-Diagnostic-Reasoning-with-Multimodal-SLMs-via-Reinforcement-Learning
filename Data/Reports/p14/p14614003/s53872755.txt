                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient intubated, sedated.  Study requested for
 evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina.  Right
 central venous catheter line terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein.  A
 left central venous catheter line terminates in the upper SVC. An enteric tube
 projects over the expected location of the stomach, however the tip is not
 included in this examination. Left pleural drain terminates in the mid-upper
 lung, slightly changed in position from prior examination.  As compared to
 prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval worsening
 of uniform opacification of the right lower lung with associated air
 bronchograms. This is consistent with increasing pleural effusion secondary to
 atelectasis.  Left peribronchial heterogeneous opacification remains, which
 may represent either an infectious process or aspiration.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. Recommend advancing 2 cm for
 standard positioning.
 
 2.  Increased moderate right pleural effusion. 
 
 3.  Persistent left peribronchial heterogeneous opacity, which could represent
 an infectious process and/or aspiration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at 1:07 PM, time of discovery.
