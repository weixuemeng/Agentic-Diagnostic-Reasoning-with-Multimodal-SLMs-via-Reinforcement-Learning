                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Spinal tenderness and fall.  Evaluate for a rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no displaced rib fracture
 seen.  A wedge compression deformity of L1 is unchanged from ___.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  Atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.  Heart size
 is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal hilar structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 Clips project over the left breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture.  If concern persists, a dedicated rib
 series with markers may be of utility and more sensitive.
