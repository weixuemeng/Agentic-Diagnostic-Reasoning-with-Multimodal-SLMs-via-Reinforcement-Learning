                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  Mediastinal contours maybe exaggerated by AP
 technique.  There is mild left base atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Mild degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 definite focal consolidation seen to suggest pneumonia, likely left basilar
 atelectasis.
