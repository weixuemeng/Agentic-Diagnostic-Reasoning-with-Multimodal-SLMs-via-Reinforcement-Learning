                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 1:31 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with asthma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably lower, producing severe crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature and making it difficult to determine if there is vascular
 congestion.  Small right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis are new.
 Widening of the upper mediastinum could be due to venous engorgement, but is
 more likely a function of low lung volumes.
