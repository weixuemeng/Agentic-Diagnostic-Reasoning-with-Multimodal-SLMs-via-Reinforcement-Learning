 pleural effusions
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Decreased lung volume is due to primarily to increasing bilateral pleural
 effusion, moderate on the right and large on the left.  Pulmonary edema is
 mild. Left lower lobe atelectasis is severe.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Mitral annulus and aortic valve calcification are heavy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing moderate right and large left pleural effusion. Persistent mild
 pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly likely due to valvular heart disease,
 especially aortic stenosis.
