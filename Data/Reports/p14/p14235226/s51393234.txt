                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated.  There is minimal left basilar and lingular
 atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Posterolateral right tenth rib appears focally expanded which
 may be due to prior fracture.  There is also evidence of prior injury at the
 distal left clavicle, though not well evaluated on this study.
