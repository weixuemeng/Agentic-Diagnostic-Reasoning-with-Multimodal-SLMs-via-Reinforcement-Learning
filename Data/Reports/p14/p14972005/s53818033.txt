                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia, two
 weeks of productive cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is status post sternotomy as
 before.  The presence of multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior
 mediastinum is indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size is not
 enlarged.  No typical configurational abnormality is present.  Thoracic aorta
 mildly widened and elongated, but without local contour abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of pleural effusion as the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No acute parenchymal
 infiltrates.  Similar as on preceding examination, there is some hazy crowding
 of the left cardiac contour identified as pleural thickening on the lateral
 view.  These findings are completely unchanged and most likely represent
 postoperative scar formations related to cardiac surgery.  Do not represent
 any acute pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of active pleural or parenchymal abnormalities.  No
 signs of pericardial effusion on lateral view.
