                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE PLAIN FILM ___ AT 22:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough, tachycardia.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 9:20.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 22:01 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC,
 unchanged.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip projecting over the stomach.  There has been interval improvement in
 aeration but with residual persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  There is likely bilateral effusions, left
 greater than right.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion.  Superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
