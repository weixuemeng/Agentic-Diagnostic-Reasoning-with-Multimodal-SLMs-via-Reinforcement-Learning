 COPD exacerbation vs pneumonia vs bronchitis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, in keeping
 with known diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bilateral
 pleural effusions have significantly improved, resolved on the left and with
 residual blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right which may reflect
 scarring/ atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
