                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pigtail catheter to waterseal,
 evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 21:54.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line, right subclavian central line,
 endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right pleural pigtail catheter,
 left-sided chest tubes and dual-lumen left subclavian arterial line are
 unchanged in position.  There continues to be extensive left lateral chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema.  A left apical and basilar pneumothorax may be
 slightly smaller than on the prior study.  There is no definite right apical
 pneumothorax, although there is some accentuated lucency at the right base
 which would raise the possibility of a basilar component.  Imaging of the
 patient in the erect position may be helpful to exclude this possibility. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Focal patchy opacities in both upper lobes may represent areas of atelectasis,
 although aspiration or pneumonia should be considered.
