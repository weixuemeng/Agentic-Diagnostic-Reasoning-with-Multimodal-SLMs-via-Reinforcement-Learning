                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with bilateral chest tube status post replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is 5 cm above level of the carina.  Right central venous
 catheter sheath is at distal right brachiocephalic which is pinched and
 appears unchanged.  Tip of left arterial subclavian is in the aortic arch. NG
 tube extends into stomach and out of view.  Left apical chest tube appears
 unchanged and is in correct position.  Interval removal of right chest tube
 and placement of right pigtail catheter is in correct position.
 
 Increased heterogeneous opacification in the right lung, unclear if there is a
 right pleural effusion. Stable mild right mediastinal shift.  Interval
 decrease in right pneumothorax.  Anterior pneumothorax on the left appears
 mildly increased with increase in subcutaneous emphysema. Increased left mid
 lung opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in correct position.
 
 2.  Mild improvement in right pneumothorax with mild increase in anterior left
 pneumothorax with increase in subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 3.  Left mid lung opacity has increased and may represent hematoma or in the
 appropriate clinical setting pneumonia.
