 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP single view chest x-ray in semi-supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter ends in main pulmonary artery,

 diaphragm in standard position.  Right pleural tube is still projected at the
 right lung base and is following the path of the minor fissure. The left
 pleural drain is in the left major fissure. Both pleural drains might not be
 working properly in this position.  
 Clear left base pneumothorax, likely also in the right lung base, but less
 evident.  Pneumomediastinum is still visible and mild.  Persist right base
 opacification with new right upper lobe opacification likely for new
 consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.  The left lung is still clear without
 pleural effusion. Small pleural effusion at the right lung base. The extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema is stable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right lung, especially in the
 right upper lobe is suspicious for pneumonia  Persistent pneumomediastinum and
 bilateral pneumothorax.  All the monitoring devices are unchanged. The pleural
 drains are positioned in the left major and right minor fissures and they
 might not be working properly. Findings were discussed with Dr ___ by Dr ___
