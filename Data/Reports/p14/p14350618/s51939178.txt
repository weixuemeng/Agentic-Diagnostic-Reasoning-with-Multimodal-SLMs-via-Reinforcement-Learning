  there is a new left chest tube in place.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
  limits evaluation however a small left anterior pneumothorax is possible.  A
  right pigtail catheters in place.  There is prominence of the RIGHT

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. 
 Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated, as well as bibasilar
 hyperlucency suggestive of pneumothoraces, likely at least moderate in size,
 but additional lateral decubitus radiographs or upright views could be
 obtained to better quantify the size of the pneumothoraces, if warranted
 clinically.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and there is
 a suggestion of coexisting pneumomediastinum.  Patchy opacity in left
 juxtahilar region has slightly worsened, and may reflect patchy atelectasis
 with or without a coexisting aspiration or pneumonia.  Known bilateral rib
 fractures have been more fully characterized on prior CT.  Findings discussed
 with Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.
