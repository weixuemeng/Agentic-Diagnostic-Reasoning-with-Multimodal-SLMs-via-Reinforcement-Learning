                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothoraces and pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate right pneumothorax has increased.  Small left pneumothorax is grossly
 unchanged.  Pneumomediastinum is less conspicuous than before.  Right central
 catheter tip is in the distal right brachiocephalic vein.  Swan-Ganz catheter
 tip is in the main pulmonary artery.  The left arterial subclavian catheter
 tip is in the aortic arch.  ET tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.  Chest tubes are in unchanged position. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema has improved.  Left perihilar opacities have
 improved.  Right lung opacities are grossly unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung pneumonia is unchanged, improved consolidation in the
 left perihilar region.  Increased right pneumothorax.
