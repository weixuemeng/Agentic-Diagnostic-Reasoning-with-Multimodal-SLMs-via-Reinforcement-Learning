                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with polytrauma, status post motorcycle accident, trauma line
 was placed over wire.  Please assess line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 1:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine frontal portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest tube has been withdrawn and now projects over the sixth
 posterior rib at the mid clavicular level and is in correct position.  ET tube
 is 4 cm above the level of the carina and in correct position.  Right
 subclavian tip is in low SVC.  Left subclavian arterial tip is in the aortic
 arch.  Right pigtail appears in correct position and end of NG tube extends
 off film.
 
 The right lung appears unchanged.  Again seen is the anterior left
 pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema.  Given supine position, it is
 difficult to assess size.  The opacity in the left mid chest is unchanged. 
 Heart size and mediastinal contour appear normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left mid thorax density which may represent hematoma or
 in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia.
