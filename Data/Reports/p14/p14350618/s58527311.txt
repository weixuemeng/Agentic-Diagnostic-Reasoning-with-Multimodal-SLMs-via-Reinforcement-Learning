                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, including two left-sided chest tubes, with a persistent
 mild-to-moderate left pneumothorax with apical and basilar components.  With
 the exception of slight improvement in subcutaneous emphysema in the left
 chest wall, there is overall no substantial change in the appearance of the
 chest since the recent study of one ___ earlier.
