                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased chest tube drainage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to have been
 removal of one of the right chest tubes.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 persists, though there is no definite pneumothorax.  Continued opacification
 at the right base that could be consistent with pneumonia.  The overlying gas
 makes it somewhat difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs.  The
 pneumomediastinum seen on the CT scan is difficult to identify at this time.
