 There is a Swan-Ganz catheter which is unchanged in position.  The
 endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and bilateral chest tubes are unchanged in
 position.  Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.  This limits evaluation of the lung
 fields.  However, there is a persistent consolidation within the right lung
 base.  Evaluation for pneumothoraces is limited; however, no large
 pneumothoraces are seen.  Overall, these findings appear stable.
