                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hematoma, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mild increase in density at the right lung base.  It could reflect
 pneumonia or aspiration.  The area has not increased in severity or size. 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  Moderate cardiomegaly without
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion.
