 INDICATION:  History: ___M with nonproductive cough and lethargy  // evaluation
 for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No new focal consolidation is seen on the frontal view, however, on the
 lateral view, there may be patchy opacification in the retrocardiac region,
 involving 1 the lower lobes.  .  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.

 Possible retrocardiac patchy opacification involving one of the lower lobes,
 best seen on the lateral view, could be due to pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting versus atelectasis/ overlap of structures.
