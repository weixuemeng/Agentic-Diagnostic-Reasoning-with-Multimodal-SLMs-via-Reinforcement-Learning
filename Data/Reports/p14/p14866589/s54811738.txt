 the carinal. The patient has also received the nasogastric tube. The right
 hemodialysis catheter is in unchanged position.  Low lung volumes. New focal
 parenchymal opacities at both the left and the right lung base, likely
 atelectatic in origin. The presence of minimal pleural effusions can no longer
 be excluded. The apical and midlung extensive parenchymal opacities are
 unchanged.
