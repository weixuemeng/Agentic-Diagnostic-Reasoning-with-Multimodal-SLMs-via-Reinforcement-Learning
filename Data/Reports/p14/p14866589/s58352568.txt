                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Severe shortness of breath, suspected pulmonary edema
 in a patient with longstanding diabetes with procedure and development of
 shortness of breath after that.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is evidence of
 bilateral perihilar opacities continuing towards the periphery of the lungs
 including interstitial Kerley B lines, findings concerning for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 In addition, there is more nodular opacity in the lateral aspect of left upper
 lobe, relatively vague but with margins that can be defined in diameter of
 approximately 3.5 cm.  It is unclear if this represents more focal
 consolidation of separate lesion.  Re-imaging of the patient after diuresis is
 required with focus on this location and if persistent, correlation with chest
 CT is necessary.
