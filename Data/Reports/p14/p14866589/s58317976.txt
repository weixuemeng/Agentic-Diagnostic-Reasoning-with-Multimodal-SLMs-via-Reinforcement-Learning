                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 07:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia, new fevers, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study of ___ at 07:47.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 07:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There continues to be bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace disease
 with worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe, right hilar region and
 left lower lobe which is concerning for worsening pulmonary edema, although a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  There is likely
 layering left effusion.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 No pneumothorax.  Previously described vague opacities in left upper lobe are
 not well appreciated on the current study.
