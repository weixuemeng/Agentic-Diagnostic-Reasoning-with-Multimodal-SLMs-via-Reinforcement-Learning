 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged and there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar compared to
 the previous exam.  Trace right pleural effusion appears decreased in size
 compared to the prior exam.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and decreased trace right pleural effusion.
 Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
