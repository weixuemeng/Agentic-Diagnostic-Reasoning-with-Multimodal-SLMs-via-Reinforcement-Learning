 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  The lung
 volumes have slightly decreased, causing increased radiodensity of the
 pre-existing known diffuse parenchymal opacities.  In addition, increased
 diameters of the vascular structures suggest overlying mild pulmonary edema. 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  The retrocardiac atelectasis is also constant. 
 The hemodialysis catheter and the PICC line on the right are in constant
 position.
