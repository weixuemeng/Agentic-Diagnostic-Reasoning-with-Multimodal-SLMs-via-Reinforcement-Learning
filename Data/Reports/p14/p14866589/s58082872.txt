                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with somnolence.  Eval for acute pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and CT chest
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest x-ray, there has been removal of the left-sided PICC
 line.  Lung volumes are low on the current study, causing bronchovascular
 crowding.  Right basilar opacity, new since prior, may reflect atelectasis or
 underlying infection in the correct clinical setting.  Streaky retrocardiac
 opacity may be atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusions, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right basilar opacity may refelct atelectasis or underlying infection in
 the correct clinical setting.
