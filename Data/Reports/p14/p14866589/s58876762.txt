                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent hospitalization with pneumonia with continued
 cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, right basilar consolidation is not excluded.  A trace left
 pleural effusion may be present.  Scattered areas of left mid to lower lung
 opacity may be due to atelectasis, although an underlying infectious process
 is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There may be mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with fluid seen tracking along the
 major fissure with overlying atelectasis.  Right basilar consolidation not
 excluded.  Likely trace left pleural effusion.  Areas of streaky opacity in
 the mid-to-lower lung may be due to atelectasis, although underlying
 infectious process or aspiration is not excluded.
