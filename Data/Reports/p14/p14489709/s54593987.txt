                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of persistent cough for
 several weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle patchy right middle lobe opacity most likely relates to atelectasis,
 although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Mediastinal contours also unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right lung base opacity most likely may relate to
 atelectasis and vascular structures, although consolidation is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Also, if there is concern for underlying
 pulmonary lesion, CT is more sensitive.
