                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intoxicated with left chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted without overt pulmonary
 edema. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis,
 but infection cannot be completely excluded. Consider repeat PA and lateral
 views of the chest when the patient is able to take a deeper inspiration.
