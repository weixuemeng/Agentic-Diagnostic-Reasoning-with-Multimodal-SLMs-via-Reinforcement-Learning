                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there is slight prominence of the hila which most likely relates
 to low lung volumes although underlying subtle consolidation or mild
 lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
