                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with APL on ATRA with shortness of breath.  At
 risk for differentiation syndrome.  Rule out pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 causing crowding of the pulmonary vessels and also making it difficult to
 detect early consolidation.  There is a possible right lower lung
 consolidation adjacent to the right heart border.  Mild interval increase in
 cardiac size compared with the prior studiy is noted.  There is no evidence of
 significant pulmonary edema.  The previously seen right subclavian line is
 unchanged in position compared with prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Possible right lower lung consolidation adjacent to the heart
 border.  Mild interval increase in cardiac size with no evidence of
 significant pulmonary edema.  
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, ___ page at
 15:27, five minutes after the finding was discovered.
