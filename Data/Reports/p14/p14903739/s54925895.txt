                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation // eval for ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.3 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses through the stomach with side port in the stomach, and
 tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Right sided central venous catheter
 tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta
 is diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within
 normal limits.  Lungs are hyperinflated with severe upper lobe predominant
 emphysematous changes, more pronounced in the right lung than on the left.  12
 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung field is present. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema.
 3. 12 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung field.  Further
 assessment with chest CT on a nonemergent basis is recommended, if no prior
 exams are available for comparison.
 4. Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Nonemergent chest CT or comparison with prior chest radiographs
 for further assessment of 12 mm right midlung field nodular opacity.
