                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of AIDS now with cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Fullness of each hilum persists and probably correlates with mild
 lymphadenopathy.  The only change is an apparent increased in density
 projecting beneath the carina on the lateral view.  This may represent a
 subtle more parenchymal density or increased lymph node.  Mild biapical
 pleuroparenchymal thickening is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size but stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute process but apparent increase in infrahilar density
 suggested only by the lateral view.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be
 helpful to assess further.
