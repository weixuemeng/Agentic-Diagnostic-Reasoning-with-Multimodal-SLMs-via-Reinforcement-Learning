                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Immunosuppression, with possible PCP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  The infrahilar density suggested on the lateral view most likely
 represents vascular structures.  No convincing evidence of acute pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
