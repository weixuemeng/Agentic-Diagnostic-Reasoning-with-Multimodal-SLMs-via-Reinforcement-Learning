                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with IVDU, altered mental status, complaints of
 chest pain found to have abrasions on body  // Rule out infection, fractures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent
 with atelectasis.  A small calcified granuloma is seen in the left lung.  No
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or edema.  The heart size is normal. The
 mediastinum is not widened.  Dextroconvex curvature of the thoracic spine is
 probably rotational.  No evidence of fracture, however this exam is not
 dedicated for imaging of the bones.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 
 2.  No evidence of fracture, but this exam is not dedicated for imaging of the
 bones.  Correlate with focal exam findings and obtained dedicated radiographs
 of the bones in these regions as needed.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlate with focal exam findings and obtained dedicated
 radiographs of the bones in these regions as needed.
