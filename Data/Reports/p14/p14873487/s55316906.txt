                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/alcoholic cirrhosis and GIB, intubated for airway
 protection. Multiple transfusions.  // Evaluate for interval development of
 edema     Evaluate for interval development of edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung
 volumes.  The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina and
 the nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.  Retrocardiac
 opacification again is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomegaly persists.
