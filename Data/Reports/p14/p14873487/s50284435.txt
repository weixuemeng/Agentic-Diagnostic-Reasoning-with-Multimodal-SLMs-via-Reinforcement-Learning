                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETOH Cirrhosis and GIB intubated for EGD 
 // ET tube placement evaluation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea.  The
 gastric tube extends below the level of the diaphragms but beyond the field of
 view of this radiograph.  The right internal jugular central venous catheter
 tip projects over the mid SVC.
 
 There has been further increase in the bilateral predominantly perihilar and
 lower lobe patchy and confluent airspace opacities, possibly reflective of
 pulmonary edema and/or multifocal pneumonia in the correct clinical context. 
 The small layering left pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac silhouette
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea.
 
 Interval increase in the bilateral predominantly in perihilar and lower lobe
 opacities, reflective of pulmonary edema and/or multifocal pneumonia in the
 proper clinical context.
