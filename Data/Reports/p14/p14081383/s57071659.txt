                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with GI bleed and intubated.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.  The patient true identity is
 not known at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 endotracheal tube ends in the mid trachea, 3.0 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube tip ends in the gastric fundus.  Lung volumes are very low
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild left basilar
 atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax or effusion. Widening of the mediastinal
 silhouette is probably due to patient position and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 3 cm above the carina.
 2.  Widened mediastinum, may relate to AP, supine technique.  Given body
 habitus, mediastinal lipomatosis may also contribute.    If there is clinical
 concern for mediastinal pathology, further evaluation can be performed with
 upright conventional radiographs or cross-sectional imaging.
