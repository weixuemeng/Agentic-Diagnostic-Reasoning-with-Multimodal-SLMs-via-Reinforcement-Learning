 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with mid upper abdominal pain. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes on the lateral view cause crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature. The lungs are clear.  Aside from mild cardiomegaly, the hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions but no focal airspace consolidation.
