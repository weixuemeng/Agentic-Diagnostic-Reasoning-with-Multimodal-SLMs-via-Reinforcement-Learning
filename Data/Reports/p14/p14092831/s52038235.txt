 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p open AAA  // eval for effusion      eval
 for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for changes in
 position, there is little overall change in the appearance of the monitoring
 and support devices. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, possibly
 with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification of the
 lower lung zones, more prominent on the left, are consistent with layering
 pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis.
