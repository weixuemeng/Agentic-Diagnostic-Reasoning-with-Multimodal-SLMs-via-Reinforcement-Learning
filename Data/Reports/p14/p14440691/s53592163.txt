                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic, neurologic symptoms.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is noted.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is likely related to low lung volumes, without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is definitively noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise noted.
