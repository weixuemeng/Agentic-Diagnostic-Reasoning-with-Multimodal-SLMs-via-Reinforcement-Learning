                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 unchanged positions, in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is
 normal with dense mitral annular calcifications re- demonstrated. The aorta is
 diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Assessment
 of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's chin and soft tissues of the
 neck projecting over this region. Lung volumes are low. There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis is demonstrated. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are mild multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
