                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer
 device with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  Lung volumes
 are low, resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Opacity at the left base likely represents atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded. There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions,
 left greater than right. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes, with left base opacity likely representing atelectasis. 
 Infection is less likely, but cannot be excluded.
 2. Possible trace pleural effusions, left greater than right.
