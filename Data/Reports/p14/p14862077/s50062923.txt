                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia and pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Right upper lobe opacity has
 markedly improved.  There is residual abnormality in the right middle lobe and
 adjacent to the minor fissure, suggesting pleural abnormality and adjacent
 atelectasis.  If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The left lung is grossly clear.
