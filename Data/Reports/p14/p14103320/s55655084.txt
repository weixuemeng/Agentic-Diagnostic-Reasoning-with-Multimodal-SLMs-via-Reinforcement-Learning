  No evidence of acute disease.  Vague nodular focus projecting over the right
  lower lung, possible nipple shadow; suggest repeat PA view with nipple markers
  when clinically appropriate to assess further.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is a vague opacity projecting over the right lower
 lung and breast, potentially a nipple shadow; alternatively perhaps it may
 reflect a confluence of bronchovascular opacities or atelectasis.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs appear clear.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Small osteophytes are
 noted along the mid thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute disease.  Vague nodular
 opacity projecting over the right lower lung field, possibly a nipple shadow. 
 When clinically appropriate, a repeat PA view with nipple markers is
 recommended to assess further.
