  1. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding bibasilar atelectasis.
  2. More focal areas of opacification in the retrocardiac area and the right
  lung base likely represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes. 
  Correlation with the lateral radiographs or frontal radiographs with increased
  lung volumes could be useful to exclude developing consolidation or underlying
  mass, if clinically feasible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob evaluate for fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-upright view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  A
 relatively radiodense 2 cm long opacity projecting over the right lower lung
 at the level of the anterior fourth rib needs further evaluation to exclude a
 small mass.  A branching more or less cylindrical opacity in the left lower
 lung could be atelectasis and/or mucoid impaction.  Cardiac silhouette is
 largely obscured by the elevated diaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or pulmonary edema.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Radiodense
 material projecting at the thoracolumbar level is consistent with prior
 vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Additional evaluation of suspected right lung mass and left basal mucoid
 impaction and atelectasis should begin with conventional chest radiographs and
 comparison to any prior chest imaging to see if chest CT scan is indicated.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Additional evaluation of suspected right lung mass and
 left basal mucoid impaction and atelectasis should begin with conventional
 chest radiographs and comparison to any prior chest imaging to see if chest CT
 scan is indicated.
