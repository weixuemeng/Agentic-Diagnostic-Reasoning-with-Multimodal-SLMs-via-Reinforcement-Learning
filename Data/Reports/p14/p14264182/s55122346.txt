  1.  Probable small bilateral effusions.
  2. A focal opacity projecting over the left lung laterally may be due to
  confluence of shadows/within the scapula however repeat frontal view suggested
  with patient's arm abducted on the left suggested to exclude underlying
  parenchymal abnormality.
  2.  Compression deformities of the mid thoracic spine, 1 of which was present
  on prior however the other is age indeterminate and clinical correlation is
  suggested.
  3.  Partially visualized left proximal humeral fracture could be old but
  clinical correlation suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with palpitations  // r/o cardiomegaly, effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left
 suggesting small effusions. There is increased opacity projecting over the
 left upper lung laterally, overlying the posterior left fifth rib and scapula.
 The lungs are hyperinflated and otherwise clear of focal consolidation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Old posterior right rib
 fracture is identified. Two mid thoracic compression deformity deformities are
 seen, 1 of which was present on previous exam however 1 appears new since
 ___. Deformity of the left proximal humerus is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Probable small bilateral effusions.
 2.  A focal opacity projecting over the left lung laterally may be due to
 confluence of shadows/within the scapula however repeat frontal view suggested
 with patient's arm abducted on the left suggested to exclude underlying
 parenchymal abnormality.
 2.  Compression deformities of the mid thoracic spine, 1 of which was present
 on prior however the other is age indeterminate and clinical correlation is
 suggested.
 3.  Partially visualized left proximal humeral fracture could be old but
 clinical correlation suggested.
