  Small bilateral pleural effusions. Focal opacity projecting over the lateral
  aspect of the right lung base could potentially be due to overlying soft
  tissues given the well delineated margins, but should be reassessed with
  repeat PA view of the chest with the arms abducted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted. Focal opacity with well delineated margins is noted
 projecting over the lateral aspect of the right lung base. Left lung is
 otherwise clear. No pneumothorax is identified. Diffuse demineralization of
 the osseous structures is again noted with compression deformities of at least
 ___ mid thoracic vertebral bodies. Remote fracture of the left humeral head is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions. Focal opacity projecting over the lateral
 aspect of the right lung base could potentially be due to overlying soft
 tissues given the well delineated margins, but should be reassessed with
 repeat PA view of the chest with the arms abducted.
