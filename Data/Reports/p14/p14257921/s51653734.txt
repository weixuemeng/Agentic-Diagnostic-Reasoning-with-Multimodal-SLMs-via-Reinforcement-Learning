                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath in a patient with history of
 sickle cell anemia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous but otherwise the mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  Lungs are substantially hyperinflated.  There is opacity at the
 left lower lobe demonstrated on both PA and lateral views that might reflect
 area of infarct but infectious process developing cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
