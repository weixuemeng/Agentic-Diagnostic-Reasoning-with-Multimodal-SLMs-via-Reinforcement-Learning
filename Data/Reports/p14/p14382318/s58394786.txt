                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and lower extremity edema, here to evaluate for pneumonia
 or evidence of fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___, ___
 and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated due to decreased lung volumes and bibasilar opacities
 but appears mildly enlarged, as before.  The thoracic aorta remains mildly
 tortuous.  There is decreased expansion at the lungs compared with the most
 recent prior study with decreased aeration at the bilateral lung bases.  There
 is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles and opacification at the left
 lower lobe compatible with small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
 underlying atelectasis and associated volume loss.  Fluid is also noted in the
 major fissure on the lateral view.  Increased interstitial lung markings
 indicate mild pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is unchanged
 loss of height at the T11 vertebral body, seen on prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions and underlying bibasilar atelectasis, all new compared to ___.
