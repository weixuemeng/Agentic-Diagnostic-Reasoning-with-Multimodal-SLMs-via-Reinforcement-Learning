 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement of the
 pre-existing right upper lobe opacity. However, the more inferior and lower
 perihilar component of the opacity has slightly increased in extent.  The
 retrocardiac atelectasis and right basal atelectasis is unchanged as compared
 to the previous image. Overall, the lung volumes remain low and the cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  Neither the frontal nor the
 lateral radiograph reveals the presence of pleural effusion.
