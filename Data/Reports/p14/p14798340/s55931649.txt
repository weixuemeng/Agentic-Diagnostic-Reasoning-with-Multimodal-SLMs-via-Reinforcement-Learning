                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with agitated delirium
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 5.4 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off
 the inferior borders of the film.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette
 size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis
 though aspiration or infection is not excluded, particularly in the
 retrocardiac region.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified
 on this supine exam.  No displaced fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Aspiration or
 infection at the lung bases is not completely excluded.
