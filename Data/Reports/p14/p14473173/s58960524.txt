                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with rib fractures.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior CT torso from
 ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Rib fractures with adjacent
 hematoma are noted in the lateral aspect of right sixth rib.  There is also
 fracture in the right fifth rib, so two ribs are fractured in a row.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Nodular opacity projecting
 over the right lower lung might potentially represent nipple given the
 relatively big nipple size of the patient as well as no pulmonary nodules
 present on a recent examination.
