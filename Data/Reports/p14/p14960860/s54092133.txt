                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large well-circumscribed gas distended structure in the left
 lower chest measures approximately ___.6 x 6.9 cm and likely reflects a large
 hiatal hernia or herniation of the stomach into the chest cavity.  Its
 presence limits the assessment of the heart size.  The mediastinum continues
 to show calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob, but no apparent
 widening was appreciated.  The lungs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis, likely
 from mass effect to the herniated stomach.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia or complete gastric herniation into the
 chest.  Entities such as gastric volvulus cannot be excluded; findings were
 discussed with ___ at 18:30 on ___ by ___.  A
 lateral veiw may be helpful in assessing anterior-posterior positioning.
