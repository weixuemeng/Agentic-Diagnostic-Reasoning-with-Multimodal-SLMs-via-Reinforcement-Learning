                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain status post MVC.  Evaluation to
 rule out rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day CT of spine.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The lungs appear grossly clear. 
 No pneumothorax.  Old granulomatous change left apex is noted.  There is
 possible focal interruption of the right fifth rib.  This may represent a
 small nondisplaced fracture here.  No other definitive acute findings noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Arguable focal disruption of the right fifth rib.  No additional
 finding of note.
