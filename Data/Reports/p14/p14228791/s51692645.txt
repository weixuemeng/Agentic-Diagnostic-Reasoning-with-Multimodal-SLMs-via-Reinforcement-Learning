                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion
 and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Some increasing opacification at the
 right base most likely represents atelectasis with crowding of vessels in the
 region of the cardiophrenic angle.  Mild blunting of the costophrenic angle is
 seen.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
