                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with trouble breathing, history of lung cancer,
 being treated.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Exam is limited
 secondary to patient positioning with obscuration of the lung apices secondary
 to patient's chin.  The lungs are grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits for position.  Subtle patchy opacity seen in the right
 mid lung.  There is no visualized pneumothorax noting obscuration of the lung
 apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam without visualized pneumothorax noting that lung
 apices are obscured.  Patchy opacity in the right mid lung, nonspecific.  PA
 and lateral may offer additional detail versus correlation with prior imaging
 should they become available.
