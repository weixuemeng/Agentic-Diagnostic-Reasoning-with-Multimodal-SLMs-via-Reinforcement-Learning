                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/bibasilar crackles, recent cardioversion, evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified is a right chest cardiac device with associated dual leads
 projecting in stable position overlying the right atrium and ventricle, in
 grossly appropriate location.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable,
 reflective of a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Increased opacity at the right mid lung may reflect crowding of
 bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes, however
 developing infection in the right middle lobe may give this appearance. 
 Elsewhere, there is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mid lung opacity may reflect early/developing pneumonia versus crowding
 of bronchovascular structures.  Attention on follow-up radiographs.  No
 pulmonary edema.
