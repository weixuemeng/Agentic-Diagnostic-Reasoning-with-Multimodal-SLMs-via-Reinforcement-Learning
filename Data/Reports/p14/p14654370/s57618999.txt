  1. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.
  2. Incidentally noted 2 cm ill-defined opacity in the right mid/lower lung.
  Recommend correlation with prior imaging to determine the chronicity.  If none
  are available, a chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy, if/when
  clinically appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated  // ? ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube extends to
 at least the body of the stomach.
 
 There is suggestion of a 2 cm ill-defined opacity in the right mid/lower lung,
 chronicity indeterminate.  There is mild interstitial irregularity,
 particularly at the lung bases, which may reflect underlying chronic lung
 disease.  No sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.
 2. Incidentally noted 2 cm ill-defined opacity in the right mid/lower lung. 
 Recommend correlation with prior imaging to determine the chronicity.  If none
 are available, a chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy, if/when
 clinically appropriate.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with prior imaging.  Consider chest CT further
 evaluation of right lung opacity, if/when clinically appropriate.
