                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with intracranial hemorrhage, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unchanged nodular opacity in the right mid lung.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Right
 apical linear calcification felt to be pleural in etiology.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Moderate acromioclavicular
 degenerative changes are noted bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Unchanged nodular density within the right mid lung for which chest CT was
 previously recommended but not yet performed.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  As before, nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation of a right mid lung nodular opacity.
