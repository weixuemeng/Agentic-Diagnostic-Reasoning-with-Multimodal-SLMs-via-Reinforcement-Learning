                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of chest were reviewed in
 comparison with prior radiographs from ___ to ___. 
 Concurrently a chest CT from ___ was also reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse interstitial opacities, predominantly in the right lung
 base and probably very mild in the left lung base are present.  When compared
 to the prior chest CT from ___, these interstitial opacities
 appear new, and given the clinical history, likely represent lung infection
 (atypical viral) or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  In view of history, a
 possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis also needs to be ruled out. 
 Compared with prior radiograph from ___, a dense opacity in the
 left perihilar region, likely radiation fibrosis has significantly improved
 over ___ to ___, as demonstrated on series of chest CT's . 
 Heart size is mildly larger and unchanged.  Irregularity of the hilar and
 mediastinal border is likely postradiation.  Ill-defined opacity in the left
 mid lung corresponds to scarring and atelectasis, as suggested on review of
 chest CT from ___.  Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal
 bilaterally.  Bilateral lower lung bases are remarkable for mild atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse interstitial opacities in the right lung and very mild in left
 lung base, in view of history most likely reflect lung infection or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  A possibility of lymphangitic spread of malignancy also
 needs to be ruled out in view of clinical history.
 
 2.  Irregularity of the mediastinal and hilar contours is attributed to the
 postradiation changes.
 
 3.  Ill-defined opacity in the left mild lung is likely atelectasis/scarring
 as suggested from a concurrent review of ___ CT.
 
 Follow-up radiograph is recommended at 4 wks to monitor changes.
 
 Above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 5:45
 p.m.
