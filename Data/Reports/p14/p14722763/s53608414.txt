                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening hypoxia in patient with pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued diffuse
 opacification involving much of the right hemithorax.  Again this could
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, though pulmonary infection or hemorrhage
 is probably more likely.  No change in the appearance of the retrocardiac
 opacification consistent with substantial volume loss or consolidation in the
 left lower lobe.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
