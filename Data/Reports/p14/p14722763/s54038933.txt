                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:59 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary embolism.  Dyspnea and pleural effusions.  Possible
 pneumonia on prior chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lung has not improved
 since ___, after worsening between ___ and ___. 
 Left lung has been relatively spared, though transiently developed a diffuse
 interstitial abnormality on the ___ before resolving the same day.  There is
 certainly a component of recoverable pulmonary edema, but the right lung
 abnormality raises concern for conditions such as pulmonary drug reaction,
 particularly to medication such as amiodarone, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage
 or even disseminated malignancy.  Apparently, the moderately enlarged heart is
 the smallest it has been over the past year and a half since ___. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Atelectasis is unchanged at the
 left lung base.
