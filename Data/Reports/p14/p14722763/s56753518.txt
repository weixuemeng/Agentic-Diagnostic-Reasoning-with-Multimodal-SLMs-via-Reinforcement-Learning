                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  History of recent
 pneumonia and history of lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiographs dated
 ___ and most recent CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are chronic interstitial changes predominantly in the
 right lower and left mid and lower lungs.  However, there is increased density
 of opacification in the right lower hemithorax concerning for developing
 infection.  Considerations include atypical infection, though asymmetric
 pulmonary edema is possible.  Given history of lung malignancy, lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis is also a consideration.  Underlying fibrotic changes are
 grossly similar with predominantly paramediastinal and lingular distribution. 
 No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is seen.  The heart size is
 enlarged, however, unchanged.  Of note, on the CT of ___, there
 was a small pericardial effusion.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse interstitial opacities increased predominantly in the
 right lower lung, concerning for developing infection.  Given history of lung
 carcinoma, however, lymphangitic spread of carcinoma as well as asymmetric
 pulmonary edema are possibilities.
