 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 1:35 PM
  IMPRESSION:
  1.  Worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic centrilobular
  emphysema and peripheral pulmonary fibrosis seen on the prior CT.  A diffuse
  infectious process involving the right lung cannot be excluded.
  2.  Persistent mild congestive heart failure causing pulmonary and mediastinal
  vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.
  3.  Bibasilar atelectasis or pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer, pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ back to ___. 
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The diffuse heterogeneous opacity
 involving the entire right lung is worse.  In addition, there is denser
 bibasilar consolidation which is largely unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly as well
 as pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion persists.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
