                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged. Relative lucency in the upper lungs is consistent with
 emphysema. The chest is mildly hyperinflated.  Streaky opacity in the lingula
 is most consistent with minor scarring or atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
