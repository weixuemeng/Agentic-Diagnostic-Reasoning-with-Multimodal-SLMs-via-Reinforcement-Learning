 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Curvilinear and linear opacities within both lower lobes likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. Lungs remain hyperinflated with attenuation of
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with emphysema. No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is not
 completely assessed on this exam.
