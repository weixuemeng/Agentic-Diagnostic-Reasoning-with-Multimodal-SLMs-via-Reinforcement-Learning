                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chroonic cough  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is most likely present enlargement of the
 left atrium. Mediastinal contour is overall unremarkable although there is
 some tortuosity of the descending aorta. Lungs are hyperinflated but
 essentially clear. Vascular calcifications are noted in the aorta. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 If further characterization of the parenchymal structure is required,
 assessment with chest CT is to be considered
 
 Minimal deviation of the upper trachea to the left is present and might be
 consistent with a right thyroid enlargement, correlation with thyroid
 ultrasound is to be considered.
