  correlation recommended to assess for superimposed infection.
  3.  Mildly hypoinflated lungs. No pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB. Assess for congestive heart failure, asthma, or
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  No focal
 opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mildly prominent mediastinum is
 likely related to patient positioning. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and
 hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mildly prominent mediastinum since ___ is likely related to patient
 positioning.
 2.  No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 3.  Mildly hypoinflated lungs.
