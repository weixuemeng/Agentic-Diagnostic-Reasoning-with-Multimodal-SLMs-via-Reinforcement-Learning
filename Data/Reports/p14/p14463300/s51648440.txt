                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is slight prominence in the region of the AP window which may be
 due to a slightly prominent pulmonary artery; however, lymph node not
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clear lungs without focal consolidation.  Slight prominence at
 the region of the AP window, slightly prominent pulmonary artery or underlying
 lymphadenopathy not excluded.  Recommend comparison with any prior chest
 radiograph and consider non-urgent CT.
