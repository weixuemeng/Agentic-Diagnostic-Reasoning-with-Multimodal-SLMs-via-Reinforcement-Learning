                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  Bilateral calcified breast implants are present. Streaky
 opacity appears probably unchanged in the lingula and is most consistent with
 minor scarring.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A deformity of the proximal left humerus is
 probably unchanged although not entirely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
