                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation or large effusion.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is an abnormal contour of the cardiac silhouette which
 appears enlarged on the right.  This could be due to more rounded pericardial
 fat pad, although underlying pericardial cyst or other abnormality is
 possible.  Tortuous descending thoracic aorta is identified.  Mild mid
 thoracic vertebral body height loss is seen, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rounded enlarged contour of the right side of the cardiac
 silhouette, potentially due to underlying enlarged fat pad or pericardial cyst
 or other abnormality.  Correlation with older films would be of use.  Mild
 vertebral body height loss of a mid thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate
 and clinical correlation is suggested regarding site of pain and need for
 additional imaging.
