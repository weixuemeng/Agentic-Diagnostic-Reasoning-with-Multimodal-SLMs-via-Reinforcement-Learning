                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with non-small cell lung carcinoma status post
 fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is status post right upper
 lobectomy.  Volume loss within the right lung appears unchanged from prior
 examination.  Surgical clips are seen in the right hilum.  No acute confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural
 effusions.  Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe corresponds with known
 adenopathy in that region.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 from prior examination.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Expected volume loss from prior right upper lobectomy, though no
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process
 2.  Enlarged mediastinal contours correspond to known adenopathy
