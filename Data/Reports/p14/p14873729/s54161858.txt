                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Additional history from
 prior CT torso reveals recurrent non-small cancer status post radiation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Torso from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There are an irregular perihilar opacities
 bilaterally which are present on prior chest CT but have developed since prior
 chest x-ray.  These could be related post radiation changes although recurrent
 tumor is also possible.  Increased interstitial markings more conspicuous at
 the left lung base with possible more confluent consolidation in the
 retrocardiac region.  New nodular opacity also seen at the left lung base not
 identified on prior CT.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles most suggestive
 of effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and again notable for
 right paratracheal adenopathy.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased perihilar interstitial markings bilaterally could in part be from
 postradiation changes however recurrent tumor is also possible.  Asymmetric
 left basilar opacity could represent superimposed infectious process. 
 Consider PA and lateral for more clear delineation of these findings when
 patient is amenable.  Nodular focus at the left lung base could be further
 characterized at this time as well.
