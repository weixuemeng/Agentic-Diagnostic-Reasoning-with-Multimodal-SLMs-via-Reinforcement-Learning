 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion,
 after failed thoracocentesis, has again increased and causes a homogeneous
 opacity over the right lung base.  The right hilar enlargement is constant in
 appearance.  On the left, there is an atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung
 regions.  No other lung parenchymal or mediastinal changes.  The appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette is constant.
