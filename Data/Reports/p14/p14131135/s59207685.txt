                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable when allowances are made for
 leftward patient rotation.  The degree of rotation limits assessment of the
 patient's known left hilar mass, which was more fully evaluated by CT of ___.  Post-obstructive changes in the lingula appear slightly improved. 
 No new or worsening lung abnormalities are detected, and there is no evidence
 of pleural effusion.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
