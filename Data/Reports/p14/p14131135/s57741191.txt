                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, hx of lung ca, tachycardia  // Acute
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.Re-demonstrated is a lateral left
 upper lung subpleural opacity.  Evidence of medial left lung/paramediastinal
 radiation fibrosis is seen, better assessed on CT.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  No definite new focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  CT is more sensitive in detecting/assessing
 pulmonary nodules.
