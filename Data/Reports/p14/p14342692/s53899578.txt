                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-healing right foot, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of parenchymal scars in the right upper lung.  On today's examination, the
 heart continues to be moderately enlarged.  The diameters of the pulmonary
 vessels are at the upper range of normal, but not pathologically increased.  A
 previously placed left internal jugular vein catheter is removed.  Moderate
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusion.  Calcifications
 projecting over the upper right mediastinum could be vascular in origin.
