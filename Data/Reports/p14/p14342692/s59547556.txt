                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Still AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 Comparison:  ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes and patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  The
 aorta is tortuous/unfolded with slight increase in prominence of the ascending
 aorta which may be due to differences in patient position.  There is minimal
 interstitial edema, possibly slightly improved since the prior study.  No
 definite focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion although a trace
 right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Tortuous aorta.  The ascending aorta is slightly more prominent as compared to
 the prior study although this could relate to differences in patient
 position/technique.  If concern for acute aortic process, chest CT is more
 sensitive.
 
 Minimal interstitial edema.
