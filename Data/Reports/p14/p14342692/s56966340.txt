  Left IJ is in stable position.  The ET tube is in the mid thoracic trachea
  approximately 4.5 cm from the carina.  Opacity of the right hemithorax has
  significantly worsened likely combination of large pleural effusion and
  atelectasis.  There is only minimal residual aeration in the right mid lung. 
  The right cardiac border is obscured however severe cardiomegaly likely
  persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Crackles on exam, failed extubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  There is a massive newly appeared opacity at the level of the
 right upper lobe, suggesting the presence of a complete right upper lobe
 atelectasis.  This is combined with an increasing amount of right pleural
 effusion so that large parts of the right hemithorax are completely opacified.
 The signs indicative of pulmonary edema in the left lung have minimally
 decreased.  The heart appears to remain enlarged.  No left-sided pneumothorax.
