 HISTORY:  Hemodialysis with recent E. coli bacteremia and osteomyelitis with
 shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with engorged pulmonary vessels. 
 Increasing opacification at the bases suggests worsening pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
