 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diabetes, hemodialysis, nonhealing foot ulcers, episode of
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the frontal image shows no
 change.  Massive tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and moderate cardiomegaly
 without overt pulmonary edema.  The lateral radiograph, however, shows small
 bilateral dorsal pleural effusions, seen in this projection only, as well as
 fluid marking of the fissures, suggestive of mild chronic interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Minimal scarring at the bases of the right
 upper lobe.
