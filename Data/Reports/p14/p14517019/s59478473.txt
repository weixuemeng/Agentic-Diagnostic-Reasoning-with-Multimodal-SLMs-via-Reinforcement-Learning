                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of primary sclerosing cholangitis, right upper
 quadrant pain with pleuritic component.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The right
 lung is clear.  Subtle patchy left base opacity is felt to most likely be due
 to vascular structures and/or atelectasis, less likely consolidation.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, hilar contours are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the hemidiaphragms.
 2.  Subtle patchy left base opacity most likely represents combination of
 vascular structures and atelectasis, less likely consolidation.
