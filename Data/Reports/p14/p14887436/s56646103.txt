                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube removed, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.  
 
 Right chest tube has been pulled out.  There is a small right pneumothorax
 with an apical small air fluid level.  Small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Right hemidiaphragm is elevated due to a loss of volume in the
 right hemithorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline.  Surgical clips
 project in the right hilum and left breast.  Mild right subcutaneous emphysema
 has improved.  Mild interstitial edema is stable.  Postoperative appearance of
 the right hilum is unchanged.
