                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker, prostate cancer, fall and feeling unwell with nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  Right-sided pacemaker
 device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is again
 noted.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is normal, with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta
 remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Streaky left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis or
 infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively seen.  There
 is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with evidence of prior
 kyphoplasty of T12 with adjacent clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.
