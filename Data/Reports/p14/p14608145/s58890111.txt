                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and consolidation on recent CT.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as more recent CT
 of the abdomen and pelvis from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears borderline enlarged.  There is similar tortuosity
 and calcification along the aorta.  Mild relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is similar.  The lateral view depicts a posterior basilar
 consolidation in the right lower lobe.  The pleural effusion visualized on the
 CT was small and not well demonstrated on radiography.  There is no evidence
 for opacification or pleural effusion on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia in the right lower lobe. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show resolution within 8 weeks.
