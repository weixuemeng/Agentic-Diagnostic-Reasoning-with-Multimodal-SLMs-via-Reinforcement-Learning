                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified. 
 There is cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity with indistinct contours
 and a mild diffuse interstitial abnormality.  A focal component of
 opacification can be seen in the medial right lower lung, probably within the
 right lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild venous hypertension or congestion. 
 Focal patchy medial right lower lung opacity, for which atelectasis could be
 considered; however, particularly if clinical findings raise concern, a
 developing focus of pneumonia could be considered and short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful.
