                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Post-op, opacities in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Right lower lobe opacities have increased, consistent with increasing
 atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe are stable. 
 Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Right PICC tip is in the mid
 SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
