                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a tortuous aorta that follows the contour of the S-shaped
 scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.  The lungs demonstrate no lobar
 consolidation, but are similar in appearance to prior exam in which subtle
 basal opacities were though to reflect components of atelectasis or
 viral/atypical infection.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Of note, the right humeral head is low-lying -- this appears chronic --??
 subluxation. 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No lobar consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.  As describe on
 prior report, subtle bibasilar opacities may represent viral/atypical
 infection; followup imaging is recommended after therapy to document
 resolution.
 2.  Apparent right glenohumeral joint subluxation. Correlate for pain.
