                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough for three weeks.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 New bibasal opacities are noted, left more than right that potentially might
 reflect viral or mycoplasma pneumonia.  Upper lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Followup of the patient in four weeks after
 completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended for documentation of
 resolution.
