                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, bilateral lower lobe
 infiltrates on radiographs at nursing facility.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, latest one on ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is a single lead pacemaker with the generator in the
 right axilla and lead ending in the left ventricle.  A tracheostomy tube is
 present. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left worse than right, with
 underlying atelectasis. Dense retrocardiac opacity might also be due to
 atelectasis, but an infectious/inflammatory process cannot be excluded. The
 aorta is tortuous, but the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable otherwise. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. Infectious
 process cannot be excluded.
