                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ptx  // ? ptx progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 17:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A small left apical pneumothorax is stable to minimally increased in size from
 ___ 33.  Unilateral left-sided pleural thickening and left-sided rib cage
 deformity is unchanged from the recent prior.  Bandlike opacity in left
 perihilar region is not fully evaluated by chest radiography but appears
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is stable to minimally increased in size from ___ 33.
 
 Unilateral left-sided pleural thickening is potentially posttraumatic in the
 setting of adjacent rib deformities, but comparison to older radiographs would
 be helpful to ensure stability and to exclude a malignant pleural process such
 mesothelioma or metastatic adenocarcinoma.  A bandlike opacity in the left
 juxta hilar region may also be assessed for retrospective stability at that
 time.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Direct comparison to the older outside radiographs to
 assess stability of left pleural thickening and left perihilar opacity.  In
 their absence, CT of the chest would be recommended.
