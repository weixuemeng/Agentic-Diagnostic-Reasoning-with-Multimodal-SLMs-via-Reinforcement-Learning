                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle right mid lung and bilateral lower lobe opacities, best seen on the
 frontal view, not definitively substantiated on the lateral view, which could
 be due to infection versus atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is slightly
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right middle lobe opacity and bibasilar opacities could be
 due to atelectasis versus infection.
