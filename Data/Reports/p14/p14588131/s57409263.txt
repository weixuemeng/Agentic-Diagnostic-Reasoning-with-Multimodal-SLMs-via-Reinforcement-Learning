                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube not effective, assess placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Nasogastric tube courses
 through the esophagus and into the stomach with tip in the distal body of the
 stomach.  Left Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Contrast is
 seen opacifying dilated loops of small bowel, incompletely assessed at the
 inferior aspect of the image.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 NG tube is appropriately positioned within the stomach.
