                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs appear
 relatively hyperinflated.  There is bibasilar plate-like atelectasis.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.  There appears to be
 moderate-to-severe compression of at least one vertebral body in the
 upper-to-mid thoracic spine of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar plate-like atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.  Compression of at least one vertebral body in the mid thoracic
 region of indeterminate age.  Recommend clinical correlation for acuity.
