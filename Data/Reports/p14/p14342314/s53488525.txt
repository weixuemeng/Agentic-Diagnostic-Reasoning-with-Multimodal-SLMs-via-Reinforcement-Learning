                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is bibasilar opacification
 with blunting of the costophrenic angles, consistent with pleural effusions
 and compressive basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult
 to exclude.
