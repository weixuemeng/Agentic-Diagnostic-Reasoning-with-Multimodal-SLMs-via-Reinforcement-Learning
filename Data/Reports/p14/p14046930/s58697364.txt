                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath, orthopnea, fever, chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis dated same day ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a new retrocardiac opacity with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  While this may reflect a component of
 atelectasis, an infection cannot be excluded.  There is likely a small left
 pleural effusion.  The right lung remains clear with linear platelike
 atelectasis within the right lower lobe.  Allowing for the decreased lung
 volumes when compared to prior radiograph dated ___, the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New retrocardiac opacification which may reflect a component of
 atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.
 2. Small left sided pleural effusion.
 3. Allowing for lower lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes appear stable.
