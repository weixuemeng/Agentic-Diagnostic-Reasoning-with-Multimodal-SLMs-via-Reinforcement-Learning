                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Increased apparent attenuation along the left mid to lower
 lung is felt most likely to represent artifact associated with slightly
 asymmetric positioning and overlying soft tissue attenuation.  Bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heart at the upper limits of normal size.  No evidence of acute
 disease.
