                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for mediastinal widening and pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is limited by patient rotation and portable technique;
 however, low lung volumes are appreciated, which accentuate the
 cardiomediastinal contours.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may
 indicate a small pleural effusion.  No discreet consolidation is appreciated. 
 Hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to portable technique and patient rotation;
 however, no clear evidence for mediastinal widening.  Small right pleural
 effusion.  No consolidation.
