                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // Eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes limits
 assessment.  Allowing for this, there is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is
 no convincing evidence for pneumonia, effusion, pneumothorax or edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged allowing for slight
 differences in technique.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise unremarkable.  Limited exam due to low
 lung volumes.
