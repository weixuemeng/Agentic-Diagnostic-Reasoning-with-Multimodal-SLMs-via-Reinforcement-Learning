                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dizziness, pain R ribs after fall two
 weeks ago
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. Comparison is made to prior
 radiograph dated ___. Mildly prominent central vessels are noted as
 well as peripheral interstitial markings compatible with mild interstitial
 edema. Heart size is within upper limits of normal though AP is a sub optimal
 technique. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is most consistent with
 small pleural effusions. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout
 the thoracolumbar spine. Osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial edema. Small pleural effusions bilaterally.
