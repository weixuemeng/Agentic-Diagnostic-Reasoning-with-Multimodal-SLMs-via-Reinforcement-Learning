 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:42 PM
  Trace if any right pleural effusion. Reticular opacities in the right lung
  with volume loss are unchanged but could mask an early infectious process.
  Close clinical attention and repeat radiograph if concerned.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided lateral and posterior pleural opacity corresponds to
 areas of pleural thickening on prior PET-CT of ___, likely
 related to previous history of talc pleurodesis.  There is associated mild
 volume loss suggesting a component of fibrothorax, and there may be a small
 residual amount of pleural fluid, but this has not appreciably changed from
 prior radiographs.  Reticular opacities in the right mid and lower lung are
 slightly more conspicuous than on the prior study.  Left lung and pleural
 surfaces are clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.  High-grade
 compression deformity in lower thoracic spine is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic right pleural thickening.
 
 2.  Slight worsening of reticular pattern in right mid and lower lung region. 
 Review of prior PET-CT from ___ demonstrates diffuse septal
 thickening in the right lung, which likely corresponds to this radiographic
 pattern.  The etiology is uncertain but could potentially be due to lymphoma. 
 Drug-induced lung disease is more typically bilateral.  An acute infectious
 process superimposed on chronic interstitial abnormalities is an additional
 consideration, and followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if
 warranted clinically.
