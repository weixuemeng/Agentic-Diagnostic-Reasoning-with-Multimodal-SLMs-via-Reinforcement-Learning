 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the known
 right pleural effusion has minimally decreased.  This decrease is more obvious
 on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The atelectatic lung areas at
 the right lung base are unchanged in extent.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the upper right and the entire left lung.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
