                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___, AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with drainage of pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, placement of tubes.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 10:59.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A single right chest tube remains in place.  There continues to be an
 elliptical opacity in the right mid lung, which likely represents fluid
 loculated within the horizontal fissure.  Associated basilar airspace disease
 is also seen, but unchanged.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There continues
 to be some nodularity to the lateral pleura on the right side which could
 reflect some loculated fluid as well.  The left lung is grossly clear. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
