 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion has minimally increased in extent.  The lateral image
 suggests that the effusion is loculated.  Also slightly increased is the
 minimal subsequent atelectasis.  Otherwise, there is no relevant change. 
 Unremarkable size and shape of the cardiac silhouette.  Unremarkable left
 lung.
