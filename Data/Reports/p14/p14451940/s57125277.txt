                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 A right-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle. 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD. Relative paucity of
 vessels in both apices likely reflects emphsematous changes related to
 background emphysema. The pulmonary hila are prominent, with a tapered
 appearance, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is unfolded.   
 
 There is patchy opacity throughout the mid and lower zones of the left lung,
 with additional retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and a small left effusion, with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is minimal patchy opacity in the right perihilar region.
 No right-sided effusion.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy opacity throughout the left lung and in the right perihilar region
 could reflect pneumonic infiltrates.  In addition, left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and small left effusion.
 
 2.  COPD with apparent emphysematous change and prominent pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 3.  Pacemaker noted.  
 
 4. Report of a chest CT obtained slightly later the same day indicated a right
 fifth rib fracture.  This is not apparent radiographically.
