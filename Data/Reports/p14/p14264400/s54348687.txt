 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4.7 cm above the carina,
 appropriately sited.  There is a nasogastric tube whose sideport is at the GE
 junction and could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement.  Heart size
 is upper limits of normal and stable.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity

 interstitial edema, new.  The opacity at the right base has increased and may
 represent developing infiltrate versus atelectasis.  No pneumothoraces are
 seen.
