                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for consolidation or pleural effusion in a ___-year-old
 woman with palpitations, new onset AFib, and a history of renal transplant.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The lungs are fairly well-aerated, with opacity at the left
 lung base unchanged and again suggestive of scarring.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting of the cardiophrenic angles
 bilaterally suggests minimal, if any, pleural effusion.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable, other than surgical clips projecting over the right
 upper quadrant, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal, if any, pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumonia.
