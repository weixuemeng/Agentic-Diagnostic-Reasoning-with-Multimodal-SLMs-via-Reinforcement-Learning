 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, status post thoracocentesis, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the remnant areas of
 atelectasis at the left lung bases have completely cleared.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged and at the upper range of normal.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  The small right pleural effusion, combined with
 a small area of right atelectasis, is minimally increased as compared to the
 previous image, but still confined to the right costophrenic sinus.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.
