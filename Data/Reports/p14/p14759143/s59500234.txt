                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with BRBPR s/p intubation  // Evaluation of ET
 tube and previous left PICC
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right internal jugular Cordis catheter projects over the upper SVC.  The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. The tip
 of the gastric tube projects below the level the diaphragms but beyond the
 field of view of this radiograph.  A left PICC line is present, the tip
 projects somewhat well lateral to the expected location of the superior
 cavoatrial junction however this may be due to patient rotation.  If there is
 ongoing concern for PICC small placement, PA and lateral chest radiographs
 could be obtained.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect
 atelectasis and/or consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea.  The tip of the
 left PICC likely projects over the superior cavoatrial junction however if
 there is concern of malposition, further evaluation with a PA and lateral
 chest radiograph to be considered.
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation.
