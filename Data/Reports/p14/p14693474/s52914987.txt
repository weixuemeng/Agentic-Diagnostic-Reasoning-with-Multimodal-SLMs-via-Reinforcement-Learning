                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of COPD with recent pneumonia and left-sided pleuritic chest
 pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  The multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph
 ___ most recent chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs appear hyperinflated and hyperlucent consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease with severe biapical emphysema.  Previously noted bibasilar
 opacities appear improved and likely represent an improving infectious
 process.  No new opacities are identified.  Left apical pleural thickening is
 again noted.  Pulmonary arteries appear enlarged consistent with pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  Cardiac contour appears within normal limits.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no acute fracture or
 dislocation.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings consistent with severe COPD, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and
 improving bibasilar interstitial process.
