                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified.  Leftward tracheal
 deviation with fullness of the right superior mediastinal border may be due to
 the presence of the thyroid nodule or goiter. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Left basilar atelectasis.  Possible right-sided thyroid
 nodule or goiter resulting in leftward tracheal deviation. Clinical
 correlation is recommended and consider nonemergent thyroid ultrasound for
 further assessment if not done previously.
