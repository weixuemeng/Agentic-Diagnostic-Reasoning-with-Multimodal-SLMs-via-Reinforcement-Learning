                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female who presents for evaluation of recent cough
 and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___; ___ and CT
 chest from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is evidence of a right lower lobe opacity; however, this
 could correlate with the previously seen nodules on the chest CT.  No other
 focal opacities are seen within the lungs.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 There is an opacity in the right lower lobe, however, this may correlate with
 the previously seen lung nodules on the chest CT. Would recommend chest CT for
 further characterization and evaluation.
