                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of CHF, AFib, COPD; now presents
 with increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable upright chest radiograph, ___, and PA and
 lateral chest radiographs, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear bilaterally with no areas of
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, masses, or lesions.  The upper lobes
 demonstrate a paucity of vascular markings, and both diaphragms are mildly
 flattened; findings are compatible with patient's diagnosis of COPD.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, and pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.  Again seen is an anterior fusion plate seen in the cervical
 spine, unchanged in position relative to the prior, with no obvious hardware
 complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of malignancy or infection.
