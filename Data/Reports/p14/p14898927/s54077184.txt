 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 right base opacity with blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be
 due to a trace pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, with possible
 underlying consolidation.  Mild left base atelectasis is seen.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity with blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 may be due to pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  Mild left base atelectasis.
