 As compared to the previous radiograph, the upper of the left chest tubes has
 been repositioned.  There is substantially improved ventilation of the left
 lung. However, a left basilar atelectasis persists in unchanged manner.  Left
 displaced rib fractures are constant in appearance. The endotracheal tube has
 been pulled back, so that intubation of the right main bronchus is no longer
 present.
