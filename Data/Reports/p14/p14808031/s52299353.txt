  Patient is significantly rotated to the right which limits comparison.
  Endotracheal tube sits roughly 2.5 cm cranial to the carinal though this is
  difficult to assess. Left chest tube removed. Right IJ approach central venous
  catheter unchanged. Right lung is clear. Multiple left-sided rib fractures re-
  demonstrated with interval accumulation of small left-sided pleural effusion
  with a increased densities in the left lower lung. While this could all
  represent atelectasis, correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended as
  pneumonia cannot be excluded.
