                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with controlled gastric fistula to chest tubes 
 // ? left effusion      ? left effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 07:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 523 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Two left chest tubes remain in place with interval decrease in size of a
 layering left effusion. No definite pneumothorax is seen, although assessment
 is challenging due to positioning. A right subclavian PICC line is unchanged
 in position. Multiple left-sided rib fractures with associated chest wall
 deformity is stable. Lung volumes are diminished and patchy bibasilar
 opacities are again seen likely reflecting atelectasis, although aspiration or
 pneumonia should also be considered. Given the patient's marked rotation,
 assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult but they are
 likely within normal limits. A left humeral prosthesis remains in place.
 Stents contiguous to surgical clips and a focus of retained contrast are again
 seen in the left upper quadrant.
