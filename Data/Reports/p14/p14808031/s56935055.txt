                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with gastric cardia perf now s/p thoracotomy  //
 pleural effusion, lung volumes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique and positioning, there has not been a
 substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study
 performed a few hr earlier. Apparent increase in extent of subcutaneous
 emphysema in left chest wall is likely projectional the considering
 fluctuating appearance on serial radiographs performed with differing degrees
 of rotation.
