                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with gastric cardia perforation into chest,
 intubated  // lung volumes, ?infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, severe leftward patient rotation limits
 assessment of cardiomediastinal contours.  Apparent worsening opacification of
 left hemi thorax, likely a combination of increasing left effusion and
 worsening collapse, but a repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to
 better quantify these processes.  In the right lung, note is made of a
 persistent small to moderate right pleural effusion and slight improvement in
 adjacent right basilar lung opacity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 9:14 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
