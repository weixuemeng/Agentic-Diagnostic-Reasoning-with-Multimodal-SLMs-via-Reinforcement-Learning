 ?stability      ?stability
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 5:09 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PIC line still passes into the right neck and out of view.  Mild right
 basal atelectasis and small right pleural effusion, some loculated, are
 unchanged. With the patient rotated severely leftward, the mediastinum
 obscures the left lower lung which is probably atelectatic and makes it hard
 to assess how much if any residual left pleural effusion is present.
 Mediastinal contours are also difficult to discern, much less evaluate
 mediastinal contents. There is no left pneumothorax. Apical and basal pleural
 tubes are still in place.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___, ___   by
 telephone on ___ at 10:01 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
