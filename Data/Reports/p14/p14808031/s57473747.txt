                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent esophageal leak.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and barium esophagram available from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The examination is limited by patient positioning.  A large left pleural
 effusion appears minimally changed since ___.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours appears stable.  A right PICC terminates at the mid to
 lower SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Esophageal stents within the stomach
 are unchanged in position. Small foci of contrast material overlying the
 gastroesophageal junction are likely from the ___ esophagram
 which had demonstrated leaks at this level. A left humerus prosthesis is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged large left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 2.  Residual contrast at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, likely
 the sequela of leaks demonstrated on the ___ esophagram.
 3.  Esophageal stents within the stomach.
