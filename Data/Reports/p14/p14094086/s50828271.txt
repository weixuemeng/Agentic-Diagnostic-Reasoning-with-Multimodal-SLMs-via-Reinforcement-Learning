                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is borderline enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Patchy opacities within the
 lung bases likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
