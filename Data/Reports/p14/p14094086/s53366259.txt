 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 coned-in view of the left lower hemithorax was also acquired, with a
 radiopaque skin marker in place.  Lung volumes are low.  The lungs are clear. 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No displaced rib fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
