                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, ___ edema  // presence of pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right base opacity is nonspecific per raises concern for consolidation,
 possibly due to infection.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 may be due to overlying soft tissues of the trace pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  No evidence of left-sided pleural effusion or focal consolidation. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta tortuous.  There is heterogeneity to the mid to distal right clavicle
 and possibly right humeral head, also seen on the prior study.  Findings could
 be due to prior trauma or degenerative change however, metastatic involvement
 could be present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity worrisome for consolidation, possibly due to
 infection, other causes not excluded.  Persistent cardiomegaly.  No frank
 pulmonary edema is seen.
