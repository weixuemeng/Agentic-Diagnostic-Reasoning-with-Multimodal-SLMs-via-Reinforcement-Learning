                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILMS ___ AT 11:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stroke.  Check nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study of ___ at 8:41.
 
 Portable supine chest film on ___ at 11:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 The nasogastric tube has been advanced and now lies with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  Lungs remain well inflated without evidence of focal
 airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Large
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable,
 given differences in patient positioning.  Hardware overlies the lower
 cervical spine, consistent with previous fusion.
