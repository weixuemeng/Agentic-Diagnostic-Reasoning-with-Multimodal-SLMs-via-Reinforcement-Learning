                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cachexia and failure to thrive, assessment for
 dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient is intubated with the ET tube tip being 7 cm above the carina. 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is substantial interval increase in left pleural effusion,
 although it might be positional.  At least moderate right pleural effusion is
 also present and right basal relatively dense opacity, potentially
 corresponding to prior aspiration as demonstrated on the CT abdomen from ___.  No appreciable pneumothorax demonstrated.
