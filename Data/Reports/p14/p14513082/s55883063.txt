 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ALL, neutropenic fever, cough, PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The tip of the right PICC line projects over the mid-to-lower SVC. 
 There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Course of the
 line is unremarkable.  Minimal linear scar at the right lung apex.  Otherwise,
 normally appearing lung parenchyma without evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.
