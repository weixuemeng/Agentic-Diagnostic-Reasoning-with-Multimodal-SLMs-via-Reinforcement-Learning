                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ALL post-VATS biopsy of purulent pleural
 nodules.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Infiltrate just
 above the right major fissure is similar.  This is unchanged since yesterday
 and remains slightly improved since ___.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Note is made of an ultrasound from yesterday
 showing only a tiny pleural effusion.  The left lung is clear.  Cardiac
 contours are normal.  A right-sided PICC line tip terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of tiny pneumothorax and right upper lobe
 perifissural opacity.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 attributible to volume loss given the abscence of more than trace effusion on
 recent ultrasound.
