 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:07 AM
  PICC tip projects over high right atrium. Retracting at least 2 cm is

  repeat radiograph is recommended to reassess tip location after repositioning.
  Retracting 3 cm could be performed since the catheter tends to migrate
  distally in this patient. Discussed with ___ by phone at 10:05 a.m. on
  ___ at time of discovery of this finding in response to wet read request.
