                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right pleural biopsy, evaluate lung expansion.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is new right-sided chest tube.  There is a small right
 lateral pneumothorax.  The right-sided PICC line tip is not well seen due to
 overlapping the spine but is probably at the SVC distally.  There is increased
 volume loss of the right upper lobe, such that the inferior portion of the
 right upper lobe infiltrate is now located higher in the chest.  The
 pleural-based abnormality on the right is again visualized and not
 substantially changed and is better characterized on the recent CT.  The lungs
 demonstrate cephalization of the vessels with hazy alveolar infiltrate
 suggesting fluid overload.
