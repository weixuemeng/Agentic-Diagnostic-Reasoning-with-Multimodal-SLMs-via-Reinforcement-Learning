                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ALL, on chemotherapy, with persistent low-grade fevers for one
 week.  Low O2 sats.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  A left
 subclavian infusion port is unchanged in position with tip in a variant
 left-sided SVC, as confirmed on CT.  Nodular and linear density in the right
 lower lung is unchanged and corresponds to focal fibrosis on CT.  The
 previously appreciated ground-glass densities on CT have no correlate on
 conventional radiography and there has at least been no progression on today's
 examination.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant change compared to examination on ___.  Subtle
 ground-glass densities on CT have no conventional radiographic correlate. 
 However, examination is no worse compared to prior.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
 ___ at 2:47 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review.
