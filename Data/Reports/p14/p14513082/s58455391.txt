                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removed this morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the right-sided chest tube. 
 There is a small residual apical lateral right-sided pneumothorax that is
 similar in size compared to the study from the prior day.  There continues to
 be an infiltrate just above the major fissure on the right, similar in size
 and location to prior.  There is volume loss/small area of infiltrate in the
 left lower lobe.  However, the overall aeration in the left lower lobe is
 slightly better than on the film from the prior day.
