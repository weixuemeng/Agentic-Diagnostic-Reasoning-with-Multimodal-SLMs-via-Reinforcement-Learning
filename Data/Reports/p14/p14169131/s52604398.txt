                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 Subtle opacity at the lung bases, particularly on the right, may be due to
 overlap of structures, although a subtle infectious process is not excluded. 
 No overt pulmonary edema seen.
