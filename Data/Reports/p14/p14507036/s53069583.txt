                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:42 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a hemothorax, following a left chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___ a second pleural pigtail catheter has been inserted projecting
 over the left lower hemithorax several centimeters above the indwelling
 catheter.  From the frontal view alone I cannot tell whether there has been
 any drainage of the previous posteriorly loculated pleural effusion, because
 the lateral pleural margin remains thickened.  Lungs are clear.  Heart size is
 normal.  Lateral view recommended when feasible.
