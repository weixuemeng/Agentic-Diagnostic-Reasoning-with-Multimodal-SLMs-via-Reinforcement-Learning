                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post pigtail catheter placement. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumothorax, unchanged.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed approximately 4 hours prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  No pigtail catheter is seen in the thorax.  The large loculated
 left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent consolidation is unchanged
 compared with prior exam.  The previously noted right basilar atelectasis has
 resolved, likely due to better inspirastory effort. There are no other
 significant changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pigtail identified in the thorax.  No significant change in
 size of left-sided loculated pleural effusion and associated consolidation.
