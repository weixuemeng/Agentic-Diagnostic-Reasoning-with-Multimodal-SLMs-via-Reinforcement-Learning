                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTs from outside institution dated ___ and ___ respectively.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large loculated left-sided pleural effusion with
 concurrent left lower lobe consolidation obscuring the left lower hemithorax
 and the left heart border, hindering assessment of heart size.  A hazy opacity
 in the left upper lung field does not appear significantly changed when
 compared with prior radiograph from outside institution allowing for technical
 differences and may reflect layering fluid.  The right lung shows some streaky
 opacity at the base, likely patchy atelectasis.  There is no right-sided
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Large loculated left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent left lower
 lobe consolidation, likely a combination of atelectasis and/or infection.  
 2.  Mild basilar atelectasis on the right.
