                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:24.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left loculated pleural effusion status
 post chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to multiple previous studies from ___ and ___.
 
 AP upright portable chest film, ___ at 14:24, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of a left basilar pigtail catheter with significant
 decrease in size of a loculated left basilar pleural effusion.  There
 continues to be patchy airspace disease in the left mid and lower lungs, most
 likely representing compressive atelectasis, although a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  Patchy opacity at the right base may
 also represent an area of patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration
 should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
