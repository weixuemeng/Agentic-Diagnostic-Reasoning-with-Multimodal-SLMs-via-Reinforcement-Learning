                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with hemothorax status post chest tube.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  There is attenuation of
 vessels,  consistent with emphysematous change.  There is a small left
 effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and a left chest tube
 in place.  Given overpenetration at the left lung apex, a tiny left apical
 pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded, though no obvious pneumothorax is
 identified.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The right lung is grossly
 clear.  No right-sided effusion is identified.  
 
 Density in the bowel suggests oral contrast.  At the edge of these films,
 surgical hardware is noted over the mandible.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:14 a.m., one of the two left-sided chest tubes has
 been removed.  Otherwise, no significant change is detected.
 
 Known right lower lobe pulmonary nodule (described on report of chest CT
 ___) is not appreciated radiographically.  Please see report of that exam.
