                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis with respiratory failure,
 intubated  // eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 16:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip 4.8 cm above the carina.  Right IJ central line appears slightly
 more distal overlying the right atrium.
 
 There are dense diffuse bilateral airspace and question interstitial opacities
 throughout both lungs allowing for technical differences, these appear more
 pronounced and confluent compared with ___.  There is new
 obscuration of the lateral right lung base and right costophrenic angle.  The
 possibility of a small right effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of diffuse opacity seen in both lungs.  Possible new small
 right effusion.  While this could reflect pulmonary edema, the possibility of
 infectious infiltrates would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Right IJ central line overlies right atrium, slightly more distal than on the
 prior film.
