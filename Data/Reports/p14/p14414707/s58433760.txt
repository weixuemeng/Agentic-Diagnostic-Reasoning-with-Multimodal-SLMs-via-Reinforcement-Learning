                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and c/f TRALI now desatting on the
 vent c/f fluid overload  // Please assess for pulmonary edema and interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 04:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip extends
 beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 Right IJ central line tip probably overlies the upper right atrium, though the
 cavoatrial junction is not well delineated.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 Again seen are diffuse opacities throughout both lungs.  Allowing for
 technical differences, these are probably similar to the prior study.  No
 gross effusions identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  Possibility that the tip of the right IJ line
 overlies the upper right atrium cannot excluded.  Doubt significant interval
 change.
 
 Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs.  Allowing for
 technical differences, this is likely similar to the prior study.  The
 appearance is compatible with CHF and pulmonary edema.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, diffuse bilateral infectious and inflammatory infiltrates
 could have a similar appearance.
