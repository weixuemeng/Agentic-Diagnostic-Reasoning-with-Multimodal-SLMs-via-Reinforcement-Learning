                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o COPD and cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b HE and varices,
 admitted to hospital with confusion and possible GIB and transferred to the
 ICU in the setting of respiratory failure s/p PRBC transfusion  // interval
 change    interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 lies approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Right IJ catheter extends to the
 cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium.  Nasogastric tube extends to the
 distal stomach.
 Again there is substantial pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions
 and compressive atelectasis at the bases, especially in the retrocardiac
 region.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to
 exclude the possibility of superimposed consolidation.
