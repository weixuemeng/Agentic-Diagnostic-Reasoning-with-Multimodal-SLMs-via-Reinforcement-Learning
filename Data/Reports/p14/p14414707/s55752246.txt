                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and c/f TRALI now desatting on the
 vent c/f fluid overload  // Please assess for pulmonary edema and interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube present, tip 3.4 cm above the carina.  Right IJ central line tip is at
 SVC/RA junction, unchanged.  Enteric tube  tip extends beneath diaphragm, off
 film.  No pneumothorax is detected allowing for overlying iatrogenic devices.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.
 
 Diffuse vascular plethora, probably with some associated interstitial and
 alveolar opacities, again seen.  The appearance is slightly improved at the
 lung bases, compared to 1 day earlier.
 
 Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive vascular plethora and vascular blurring, with more focal opacities
 at the bases, suggestive of pulmonary edema.  Opacities at both bases remain
 present, but appear slightly improved.  The differential includes other
 etiologies, including infectious and inflammatory infiltrates.
