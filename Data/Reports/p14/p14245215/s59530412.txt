                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Concern for foreign body on prior chest x-ray.
 
 CHEST, TWO PORTABLE VIEWS, AN AP VIEW AND A STEEP OBLIQUE VIEW TO INCLUDE THE
 NECK.
 
 No foreign body was visualized.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 10:11 a.m.
 
 On the current exam, the complete metallic foreign body is seen superimposed
 over the left neck.  It liesto the left of the midline chest tube and extends
 from the approximate C3-C5 level, with its inferior edge overlying the upper
 portion of the left piriform sinus.  On the oblique view, it overlies the
 chest tube and extends slightly anterior and  posterior to it.  
 
 A chest x-ray obtained at 2:25 a.m. on ___ shows the same anatomic area,
 with the ET and NG tibes both present, but with no abnormal radiopaque foreign
 body visible.  A scout image from a ___ head CT showed extensive metal in
 the  maxillary teeth, some of which is no longer visible in the mouth.  Some
 residual dental metallic densities are seen at both right and left extreme
 edges of the maxillary teeth with an additional stable focus in the lower
 right mandible teeth.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Apparent dislodgement of maxillary dental metal - ? amalgam, bridge or other
 dental appliance -- that is now superimposed over the airway in the left neck.
 Further evaluation of the patient to confirm that this does not lie outside
 the patient is requested, but this appearance otherwise suggests that this
 dental metal foreign body lies within the hypopharanx.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at
 approximately 3:15 p.m. on the day of the exam, by Dr. ___ by phone.
