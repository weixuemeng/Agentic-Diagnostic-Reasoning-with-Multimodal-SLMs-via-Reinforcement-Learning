                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Atrial fibrillation, lower extremity edema, CHF.
 
 Comparison is made with old study dating back to ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly, tortuous aorta and enlarged pulmonary arteries are
 unchanged.  There is increase in the AP diameter of the chest and flattening
 of the hemidiaphragms, suggesting COPD.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 effusion.  Dense nodules in the right upper lobe are likely calcified
 granulomas.  Right pleural effusion is small.  There is a linear atelectasis
 in the right lower lobe.  There is very mild interstitial edema.
