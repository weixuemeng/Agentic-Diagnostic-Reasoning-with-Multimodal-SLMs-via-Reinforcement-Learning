 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:57 PM
  Increased, more dense, right lower lung airspace opacification. Increased left
  lung opacification may relate to a layering effusion, volume loss from mucous
  plugging, or even consolidation. Otherwise, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, hypovolemia, underlying CHF and status post IVF and
 hypoxemia, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, ROTATED POSITIONING:  
 
 Compared to earlier the same day at 12:53 p.m. and allowing for technical
 differences, the degree of opacity at the right base may be slightly
 increased.    The degree of opacity at the left lung apex is also increased. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 As before, there is truncation of the left-sided airway, though this occurs
 slightly more proximal now at the distal left main stem bronchus, with
 near-complete opacification of the left lung,  notably worse in the left lung
 apex than it was on the prior film.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured.  The
 right lung shows background COPD with patchy opacity and possible pleural
 fluid/thickening at the right base, which also appears slightly worse compared
 with the prior film.  Allowing for patient rotation, the trachea remains
 midline.  An area of focal expansion of the trachea immediately above the
 aortic knob is suggested, probably unchanged.  There is mild vascular plethora
 visualized in the aerated portion of the right upper lung, but otherwise, no
 definite evidence of CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Overall similar to CXR from earlier the same day, but with increased opacity
 at left apex and ? right base since that film.  Compared with the film from
 ___, where there was considerable opacification of the left mid zone,
 findings in the left upper lung and right base have clearly progressed.  
 
 If clinically indicated, CT may help for further assessment.
