 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again markedly enlarged.  The left lung base is
 opacified, which is difficult to assess in greater detail, but may reflect
 pleural effusion, possibly with atelectasis or even pneumonia.  There is
 probably at least a trace pleural effusion on the right.  There is increased
 perihilar fullness bilaterally suggesting mild vascular congestion.  A new
 opacity in the right lower lung is relatively focal and potentially indicates
 pneumonia.  An atypical distribution of pulmonary edema could also be
 considered, however.  Moderate rightward spinal curvature is centered along
 the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy basilar opacities in addition to suspected pulmonary
 congestion, at least mild.  Whether the latter may also potentially explain
 right basilar opacity is uncertain, and developing pneumonia or an atypical
 distribution of edema could be considered.
