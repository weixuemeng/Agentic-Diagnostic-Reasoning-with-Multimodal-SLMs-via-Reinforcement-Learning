                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question mucous plugging and OG tube.  Evaluate placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  ROTATED POSITIONING.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 18:04 p.m.
 
 ET tube is present, tip projects above the level of the medial clavicular
 heads, approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. NG tube is present, the tip
 extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the upper abdomen.  The right-sided
 PICC line tip appears to overlie the proximal SVC, similar to prior. 
 
 Again seen is severe cardiomegaly and increased opacity in both lungs.  Given
 the degree of rotation, detailed assessment of the parenchyma is difficult,
 but the possibility of bilateral effusions and some degree of vascular
 plethora would be difficult to exclude.   No definite change in overall
 appearance of the lungs compared with the prior film.
