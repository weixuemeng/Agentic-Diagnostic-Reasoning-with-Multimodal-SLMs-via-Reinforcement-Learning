                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia or mucus plugging with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  There is again substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  There is some improvement in aeration of the left
 hemithorax, though there is still substantial volume loss in the left lung. 
 The aerated portion to the left lung shows no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 The areas of opacification at the right mid and lower lung zones are
 essentially unchanged.
