                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and possible pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has worsened, but there is no accompanying pulmonary
 vascular congestion, edema, or pleural effusion.  Small area of increased
 radiopacity projecting over the middle third of the right clavicle and first
 rib is probably osseous, but I would recommend a lordotic view just to make
 sure there is no lung lesion.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.  Mediastinal fat distorts the contour of the
 left heart border.
 
 Dislocation of the right shoulder is chronic.
