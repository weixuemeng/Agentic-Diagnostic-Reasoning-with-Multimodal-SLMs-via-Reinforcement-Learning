                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  New onset AFib, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There is probably some pulmonary hyperinflation present.  Cardiomegaly is
 suggested.  Some nonspecifically increased lung markings are evident, and
 there is also evidence of some biapical symmetrical pleural capping.  The left
 retrocardiac area is poorly visualized, particularly laterally, but there is
 no definitive pneumonic consolidation.  Osseous structures demonstrate
 multilevel degenerative change and a gentle dorsal kyphosis.  There appears to
 be a chronic anterior dislocation of the right shoulder.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No definitive acute findings.
