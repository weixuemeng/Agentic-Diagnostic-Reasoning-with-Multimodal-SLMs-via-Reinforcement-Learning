                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with urosepsis, continued tachycardia  // ?
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient positioning is somewhat suboptimal as the patient's head obscures the
 right lung apex.  Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  A
 well-defined opacity projecting over the left hemi thorax is likely something
 on the patient's skin as it does not conform to anatomic landmarks.  Small
 right pleural effusion, no left pleural effusion seen.  No consolidation or
 pneumothorax seen.  Streaky retrocardiac opacities are unchanged compared to
 the prior study and likely reflect left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  An opacity
 projecting over the left hemi thorax is thought likely be something on the
 patient's skin.
