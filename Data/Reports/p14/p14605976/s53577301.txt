                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, cough, hx pneumonia  // r/o
 pneumonia      r/o pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the cardiac silhouette remains within
 normal limits.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.  However, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia in this region.
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular
 congestion.  Blunting of what appears to be the left costophrenic angle on the
 lateral view could reflect pleural fluid.
