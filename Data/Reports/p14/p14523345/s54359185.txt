                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle opacities in the right middle lobe somewhat obscuring the
 right medial heart border felt to more likely represent overlapping
 vasculature structures, but developing pneumonia not entirely excluded. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
