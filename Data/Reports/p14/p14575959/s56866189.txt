                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is a single lead
 right-sided pacemaker with distal aspect of the lead not well seen due to
 underpenetration but grossly, unchanged in position as compared to the prior
 study.  There are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  There is basilar atelectasis, particularly on the
 left.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  The posterior costophrenic
 angles are not fully fully included on the lateral view but no large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with likely left basilar atelectasis.
