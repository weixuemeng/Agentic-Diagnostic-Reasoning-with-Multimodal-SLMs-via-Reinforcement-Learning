  - compared with ___
  
  - mildly decreased lung volumes.  Borderline enlarged heart size.  Scattered
  peribronchial cuffing without definite interlobular septal lines or pleural
  effusion.  Vague left lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis, though in the
  appropriate clinical context, infection is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, wheezes, chest pain  and hypoxia. 
 // Please evaluate for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low with vascular crowding but no frank pulmonary
 edema.  There is mild bronchial wall thickening.  There is no definite focal
 airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild bronchial wall thickening without definite focal airspace opacity
 could reflect bronchitis.  There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
