  1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina, withdrawal of at
  least 2 cm is recommended for adequate positioning. 
  
  2.  Low lung volumes and patient's positional rotation accentuates the cardiac
  silhouette and mediastinal structures. Linear opacity at the left lung base
  likely represents atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina and an orogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm, with tip terminating within the gastric fundus. 
 Low lung volumes and patient's rotated position accentuates the cardiac
 silhouette and mediastinal contours.  An area of patchy opacity is seen in the
 left lung base and likely represents atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina, and withdrawal of at
 least 2 cm is recommended for adequate positioning. 
 
 2.  Low lung volumes and patient's positional rotation accentuates the cardiac
 silhouette and mediastinal structures. Patchy opacity at the left lung base
 likely represents atelectasis.
