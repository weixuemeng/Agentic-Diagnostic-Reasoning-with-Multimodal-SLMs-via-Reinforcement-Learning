                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, head injury.  Evaluate for traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no displaced rib fracture. 
 If there is still concern for a rib fracture, a dedicated rib series with
 markers would be of utility. 
 
 The lung volumes are slightly lower than prior.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.  Minimal apical symmetric
 pleural thickening is unchanged.
