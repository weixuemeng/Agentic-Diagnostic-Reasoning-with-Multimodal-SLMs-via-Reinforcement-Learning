                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post drug overdose, is now intubated
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube tip ends 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The nasogastric
 tube ends in the body of the stomach with side holes at or just below the
 level of the gastroesophageal junction, needs to be further advanced for
 optimal positioning. The NG tube has been retracted since earlier study.  New
 heterogeneous opacification in the right lung base, is worrisome for either
 developing pneumonia or aspiration.  A small right pleural effusion is likely
 present.  The left lung is clear, without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
   IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Heterogeneous new opacification in the right lung base, worrisome for
 either a developing pneumonia or aspiration.
 2.  NG tube has been retracted since prior study, with sideholes at or just
 below the gastroesophageal junction, needs to be advanced further for optimal
 positioning.
