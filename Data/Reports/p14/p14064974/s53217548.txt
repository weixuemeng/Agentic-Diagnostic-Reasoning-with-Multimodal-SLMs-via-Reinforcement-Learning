                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypertensive emergency, pulmonary edema 
 // improvement of fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:10
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a rounded mass in the left upper zone, similar to prior.
 
 Compared the prior study, there is a new small to moderate left effusion.  A
 small right effusion is either new or increased.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF, similar to prior.  On today's study, patchy opacities at the bases
 are more pronounced, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper zone mass again noted, unchanged.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly similar to prior.
 
 CHF with pulmonary edema, which appears worse compared 1 day earlier, with
 progression of focal opacities at both lung bases, compatible with collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 New small to moderate size left pleural effusion.  New or slightly more
 pronounced small right pleural effusion.
