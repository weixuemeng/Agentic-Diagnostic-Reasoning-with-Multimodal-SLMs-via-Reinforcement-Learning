                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob after iv dye  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities and
 reticular markings likely representing septal thickening, all of which are
 compatible with pulmonary edema.  A mass overlies the left lung measuring 3.8
 x 3.7 cm, minimally changed in size from chest CT ___.  There is
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which may be compatible with a
 trace bilateral pleural effusions Linear opacities overlying both lower lobes
 likely represent subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Opacity overlying the left lung measuring up to 3.8 cm likely represents
