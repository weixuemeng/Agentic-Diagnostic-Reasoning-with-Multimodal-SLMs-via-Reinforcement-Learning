 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:00 PM
  Persistent right greater than left lung base opacities in the setting of low
  lung volumes, minimally improved compared to the prior examination likely
  representing atelectasis. Focal opacity projecting over the right chest wall
  port, potentially due to external object/ dressing over port during access, to
  be correlated clinically.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular approach Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right
 atrium.  Heart size is normal with unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low.  There are persistent right
 greater than left lung base opacities, appearing slightly improved compared to
 prior examination.  Opacity projecting over the right chest wall port could be
 external in nature, no correlate opacity confirmed on the lateral.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 lung volumes, minimally improved compared to the prior examination likely
 representing atelectasis.  Focal opacity projecting over the right chest wall
