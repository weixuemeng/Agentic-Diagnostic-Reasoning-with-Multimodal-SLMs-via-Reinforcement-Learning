                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic pancreatic cancer with unclear
 opacity in RUL  // Please eval for interval change and reassess RUL, ?opacity
 vs. overlying structure     Please eval for interval change and reassess RUL,
 ?opacity vs. overlying structure
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion right lower lobe atelectasis have increased
 since ___.  Abnormality questioned in the right upper lobe would give the
 appearance of an abscess, since it has a central lucency, but there was no
 corresponding abnormalities on yesterday's chest radiograph.  It would be
 reasonable to re-evaluate this with CT scan.  There is no pneumonia on the
 left, but there is a new or newly apparent 25 mm wide peripheral nodular
 opacity projecting over the left upper lobe at the level of the anterior third
 interspace.  This could be part of the adjacent cardiac monitoring device, but
 if not raises concern for septic pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction.
 
 Right central venous infusion catheter ends in the right atrium.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CTA.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 3:57 PM, 1 or minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
