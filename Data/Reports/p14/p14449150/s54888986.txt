                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous. 
 Mediastinal hilar contours are similar.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy ill-defined opacities are noted in both lung bases which may
 reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The biliary stent catheter is seen
 within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
