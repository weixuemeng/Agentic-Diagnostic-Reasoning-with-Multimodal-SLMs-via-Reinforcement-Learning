                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:41 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after intubation and esophagoscopy.  Rales, rule
 out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Heart is moderately-to-severely enlarged.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no edema or pleural effusion.
 Widening contours of the lower mediastinum is due either to dilated esophagus
 or hiatus hernia in most cases.  Presumably, esophagoscopy resolve the issue,
 but CT scanning would do the same.
