 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with gastric cancer presents with 1.5wks LUQ

 The right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction,
 unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is also unchanged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 with emphysema most pronounced at the lung apices.  Compared to the prior
 studies, there is new minimal interstitial edema denoted by new linear
 opacities radiating from the hilar regions bilaterally.  Minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacities in the right lung base, likely
 due to scarring or atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared with the prior chest radiograph, pulmonary vascular congestion and
 minimal interstitial edema are new.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.
