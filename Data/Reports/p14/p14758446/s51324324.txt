                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L hip ORIF, post op s/p OG placement.  OG
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new OG tube terminates in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced
 approximately 10 cm to position all of the sideholes in the stomach. Lungs are
 hyperinflated, but clear without effusion or consolidation. Heart,
 mediastinum, hila, and pleural surfaces are normal. Old healed left rib
 fractures are unchanged.
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina and should not be
 withdrawn any further. The caliber of the endotracheal ET cuff exceeds that of
 the native trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. OG tube terminates in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced
 approximately 10 cm to position all of the sideholes in the stomach.
 
 2. Caliber of the ET tube cuff exceeds that of the native trachea.  It would
 be important to determine if this degree of overinflation is necessary from a
 clinical standpoint.
