                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Large thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
 decreased breath sounds.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained at 4:02 p.m.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including post-sternotomy wires. 
 Mild vascular engorgement is present.  Left basal opacity is redemonstrated,
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior study and might potentially reflect
 aspiration or atelectasis.  No appreciable pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
