                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta
 is mildly tortuous and calcified.  Otherwise, the cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 suggests minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe narrowing is noted
 along a lower thoracic interspace with subchondral sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity probably due to minor atelectasis,
 otherwise unremarkable.
