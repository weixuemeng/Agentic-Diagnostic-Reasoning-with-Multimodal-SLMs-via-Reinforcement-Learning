 tip projecting over the stomach.  A left-sided pacing device remains in place.
 The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet
 approximately 6 cm above the carina.
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There is improved aeration in
 the right mid lung with patchy opacity now seen at the right base which may
 reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered.  The pulmonary vasculature is prominent suggesting fluid replete
 state but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No pneumothorax.
