 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:50 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 6 cm above
 the carina. A single lead left-sided pacing device is in place with the tip
 terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart is
 enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should
 also be considered. Focal opacity in the mid to lower right lung would be
 concerning for aspiration or pneumonia, less likely pulmonary hemorrhage,
 given that the left lung is grossly clear.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 No pulmonary edema or large effusions. No pneumothorax.
