 Supine view of the chest provided.
 
 Low lung volumes cause mild bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Within the limits of a single supine view, there is no
 evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominent interstitium is similar to
 prior.  In addition, there is diffuse increase in interstitial markings. 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Left chest cardiac device and leads
 are in similar position compared to prior.

 2. Diffuse increase in interstitial markings may be due to edema, or possibly
 a diffuse infectious process.
