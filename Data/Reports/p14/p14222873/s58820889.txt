 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent liver transplant, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 liver transplant.  An area of scarring at the right lung bases is in unchanged
 extent and morphology.  The lung volumes are low.  The presence of bilateral
 small pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  There is mild-to-moderate fluid
 overload, the size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
