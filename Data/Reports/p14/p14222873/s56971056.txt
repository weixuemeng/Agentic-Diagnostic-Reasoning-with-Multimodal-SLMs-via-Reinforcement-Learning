                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs relatively hyperinflated peerbasilar atelectasis is seen without
 definite focal consolidation.  There is slight blunting of the costophrenic
 angles on the frontal view which may be due to pleural thickening or trace
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen. 
 Again seen chronic appearing lower left lateral rib deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight blunting of the costophrenic
 angles may be due to trace pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.
