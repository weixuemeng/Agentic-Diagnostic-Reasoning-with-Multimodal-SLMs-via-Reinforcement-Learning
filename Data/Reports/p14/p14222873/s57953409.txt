 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pulmonary changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing signs
 indicative of pulmonary edema have almost completely resolved.  On today's
 image, the lungs are clear, with exception of very subtle peribronchial
 opacities at the bases of the right lung could reflect chronic airways
 changes.  Typical features of pneumonia or pulmonary edema are not present. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  Normal hilar
 and mediastinal contours.
