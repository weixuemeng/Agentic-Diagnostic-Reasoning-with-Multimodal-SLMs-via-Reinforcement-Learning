                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TAVR via transapical approach  // pleural
 effusion, CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray dated ___ M head and head and advanced
 healing ay ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for changes in position, there is no gross change in the position of
 the prosthetic aortic valve. There has been interval removal of a left-sided
 PICC line.
 
 There is severe dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine, without significant
 interval change compared to prior examination.
 
 There is a tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta which is stable in
 appearance.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited given low lung
 volumes and rotation/positioning, however there is no appreciable change as
 compared to prior examination.
 
 Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm and secondary relaxation
 atelectasis of left lower lobe as seen on prior studies. There has been marked
 interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion as well as improvement
 in previously seen bibasilar opacities as compared to prior film.  There are
 faint calcifications visualized in the medial right upper lobe which correlate
 to calcifications seen in the right subclavian artery on prior CT examination.
 
 There are no pneumothoraces or effusions seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pleural effusion. Marked improvement in pulmonary vascular
 congestion; no other significant interval change.
