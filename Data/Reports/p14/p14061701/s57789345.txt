  Low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar
  opacities likely reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,

  Interval decrease in pulmonary edema.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman h/o myasthenia ___, s/p lap chole, now with
 decreasing oxygen sat with ambulation  // please evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities in the right
 and left lung bases have increased in extent and severity.  Hilar enlargement
