                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recurrent abdominal pain, today with
 distension, chest pain and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity in the
 right lower lobe is without substantial interval change from the previous
 examination.  A trace right pleural effusion appears minimally increased from
 the prior study.  Left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lobe opacity, not substantially changed in the interval,
 likely reflective of continued pneumonia.  Trace right pleural effusion,
 perhaps minimally increased.
