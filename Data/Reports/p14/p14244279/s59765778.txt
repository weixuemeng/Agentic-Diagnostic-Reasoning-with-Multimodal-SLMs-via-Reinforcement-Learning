                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  Evaluate for mediastinal
 widening or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Blunted right costophrenic angle likely reflects
 pleural scarring. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No displaced
 rib fracture is seen.  No free air under the diaphragm. Partially imaged in
 anterior cervical spinal fusion hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
