                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. There is a vague opacity in the right lower lobe,
 which has been present intermittently on prior studies.  Although this may
 represent postinflammatory changes, pneumonia can not be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation and follow up imaging would be advised especially if the
 patient's symptoms persist.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity in the right lower lobe, which may represent post inflammatory
 changes or may be acute.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Follow up
 imaging should be performed if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen.
