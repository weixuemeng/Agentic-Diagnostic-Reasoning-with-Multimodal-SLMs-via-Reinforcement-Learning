                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with substernal chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta
 appearing unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Patchy opacities
 noted in the lung bases bilaterally, more so on the right.  Cervical spinal
 fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more so on the right, may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
