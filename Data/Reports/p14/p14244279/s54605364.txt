                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal streaky and linear opacities
 in the right lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle likely reflects a small amount of pleural thickening,
 not changed in the interval.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle likely reflects chronic pleural thickening, not
 changed in the interval.
