                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-radiating chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is a
 5-mm nodular opacity in right mid lung projecting over the ___ posterior rib,
 possibly a lung nodule.  Ill-defined opacity at the right medial lung base,
 with associated silhouetting of the lower right heart border is not
 significantly changed compared to prior radiographs from ___ and
 is likely related to a prominent epicardial fat pad, as seen on CT from
 ___.  No focal consolidations are seen.  There is evidence of
 mild emphysema.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Cervical fusion hardware is
 not fully assessed.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 noted, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 2.  Possible 5-mm right mid lung nodule should be further evaluated with chest
 CT.
 
 Findings and recommendation were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 5:15 p.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
