                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dizziness and dehydration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Vague opacity in the right lower lung is stable and suggests
 minor atelectasis or scarring.  Fissures are minimally thickened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal thickening of the fissures, which may be a consequence of
 very slight fluid overload but no definite evidence for pneumonia or
 parenchymal edema.
