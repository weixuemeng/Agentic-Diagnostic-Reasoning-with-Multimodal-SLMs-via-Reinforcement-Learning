                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart is top-normal size given the lung volumes. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.  There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Right
 brachiocephalic/subclavian stent is again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which limits assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy opacities
 at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
