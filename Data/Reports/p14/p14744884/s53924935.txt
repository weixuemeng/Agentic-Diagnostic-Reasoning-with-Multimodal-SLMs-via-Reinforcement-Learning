                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of acute onset
 abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable erect view of the chest was obtained. 
 Relatively increase in opacity projecting over the right lung base is seen,
 which raises concern for underlying consolidation.  Dedicated PA and lateral
 views of the chest would be helpful for further evaluation.  Left lung is
 clear.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely relates to
 overlying soft tissue.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Right-sided vascular
 stent is unchanged in position.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the
 hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity could be due to consolidation from pneumonia. 
 PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful for further evaluation.  No
 evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
