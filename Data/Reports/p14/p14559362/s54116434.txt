                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and history of CHF. 
 Evaluate for infiltrates or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  There is bilateral diffuse interstitial
 thickening with vascular cephalization in the setting of moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly.  There is an associated left-sided pleural effusion, better
 assessed in lateral radiograph.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A unicameral pacemaker is noted in the left axilla with the
 lead ending in the left ventricle.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  Mediastinal
 surgical clips are noted along the left margin of the heart. Abandoned
 epicardial leads are seen anterior to the heart.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema with associated left-sided pleural effusion in
 the setting of moderate cardiomegaly. Of note, isolated left sided effusion
 can occur with pericardial effusion. If there is clinical suspicion or
 precipitating factor for pericardial effusion such as recent thoracic
 procedure, further assessment with echocardiogram should be pursued.
