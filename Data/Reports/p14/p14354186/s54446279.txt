                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low with faint linear densities in the lower lungs most compatible
 with atelectasis.  There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable.  There is a somewhat rounded appearance of the right pulmonary
 hilum which appears stable from multiple prior radiographs dating back to
 ___, likely representing ectatic vasculature.  Bony structures are intact.
