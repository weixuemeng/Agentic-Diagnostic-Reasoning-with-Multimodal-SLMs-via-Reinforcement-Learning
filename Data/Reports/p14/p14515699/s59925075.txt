                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions are again seen with
 overlying atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities may represent combination of
 effusions and atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
