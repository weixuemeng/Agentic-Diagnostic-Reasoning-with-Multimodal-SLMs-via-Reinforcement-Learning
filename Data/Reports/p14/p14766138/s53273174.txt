                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with exertional chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the
 aorta appearing mildly tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Streaky opacity in the right middle lobe is slightly more pronounced in the
 interval, compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Scattered
 calcified granulomas are again noted in the lung bases.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  Loss of height of an upper/mid thoracic vertebral
 body appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase streaky right middle lobe opacity likely reflective of subsegmental
 atelectasis.
