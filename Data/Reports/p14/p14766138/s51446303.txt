 pleural fluid on the left has minimally increased in extent, the lung volumes
 are lower, likely caused by a lesser inspiratory effort. Subsequent crowding
 of the vascular and bronchial structures at both lung bases.  No pneumothorax.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema.  The
 position of the left pigtail catheter is constant.
