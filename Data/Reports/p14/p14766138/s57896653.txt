                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate after intubation and left central venous catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately
 2.2 cm from the carina.  A left internal jugular central venous catheter is
 present with the tip in the upper SVC.  A right hemodialysis catheter is
 unchanged with the tip at or just beyond the cavoatrial junction.  An enteric
 tube is present coursing below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of
 view.
 
 Since prior exam, the lung volumes have improved, likely due to mechanical
 ventilation.  There is a persistent dense opacity in the right base consistent
 with pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema is not significantly changed.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
 2.  Persistent right basilar pneumonia and mild pulmonary edema.
