 excluded. Patchy right basilar opacity may also reflect atelectasis. A trace
 left pleural effusion also appears new in the interval. No pneumothorax is

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and new retrocardiac opacity, potentially
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration are not excluded. Small left
 pleural effusion, also new in the interval.
