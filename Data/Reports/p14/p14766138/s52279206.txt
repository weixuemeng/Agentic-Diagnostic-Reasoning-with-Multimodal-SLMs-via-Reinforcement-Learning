                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension into the ___ this a.m. and
 bilateral lower extremity pain.  Question vascular congestion or infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Previously identified right-sided PICC line is no longer
 visualized.  There is a focal opacity seen in the left mid lung and adjacent
 to the hilum, potentially due to focal infiltrate.  Opacity obscuring the
 right heart border is less conspicuous on the current exam.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are clear and there is no effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity in the left mid lung, potentially due to
 infiltrate.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
