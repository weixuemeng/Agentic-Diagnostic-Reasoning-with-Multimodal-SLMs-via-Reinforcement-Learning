                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension  // eval for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at
 the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  New
 consolidative opacification is seen involving the entire left upper lobe. 
 Right lung is clear.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with underlying
 emphysema.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine
 exam.  Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidative opacification involving the entire left upper lobe is concerning
 for pneumonia.  Please note that pulmonary embolism with infarction is not
 excluded, and if there is concern, a chest CT is recommended.  Emphysema.
