 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, left upper lobe airspace
 consolidation has minimally decreased in extent, but an area of consolidation
 in the left retrocardiac region has worsened.  Additionally, areas of
 peribronchial thickening in adjacent peribronchiolar opacification in right
 juxta hilar region persist.  These findings are likely due to multifocal
 infection.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for tip of endotracheal tube
 terminating within 1.5 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position.
