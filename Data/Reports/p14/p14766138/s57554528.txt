 INDICATION:  Chest pain, rule out acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in the left pleural effusion, now moderate in
 size. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which likely due to a
 combination of pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, although
 developing consolidation cannot be excluded. The right lung is clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in left pleural effusion, now moderate with likely
 compressive atelectasis, although a developing consolidation cannot be
 excluded at the left lung base.
