                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of HIV and multiple myeloma, now
 with recent CT demonstrating left lower lobe collapse, here to assess for
 interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are linear opacities in the left lower lobe which is not as
 extensive as the area of collapse seen on recent CT, but likely represents a
 small residual atelectasis.  There is also a linear opacity projecting over
 the heart on the lateral view, which likely corresponds to atelectasis in the
 right middle lobe.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The cardiac silhouette size is borderline but unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small residual atelectasis in the left lower lobe decreased from
 that seen on recent CT.  Minimal right middle lobe atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation.
