                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips project over the lower neck and right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen, as before.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Streaky right lower lung opacities are most suggestive of
 minor atelectasis, also seen in the left costophrenic sulcus.  Otherwise,
 however, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Small left axillary calcifications are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
