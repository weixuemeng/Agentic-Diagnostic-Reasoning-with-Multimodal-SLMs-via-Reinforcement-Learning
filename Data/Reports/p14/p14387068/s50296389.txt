                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with collapsed right in setting of a tension
 pneumothorax, status post thoracocentesis.  Please evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a decreased though persistent right-sided
 hydropneumothorax with interval incomplete reexpansion of the right lung.  No
 significant mediastinal shift identified with unremarkable mediastinal, hilar,
 and cardiac contours.  Right lower lung opacifications may reflect combination
 of reexpansion edema and atelectasis. Minimal left lung atelectasis noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving right hydropneumothorax with right lower lung
 opacifications, atelectasis versus edema are likely.
