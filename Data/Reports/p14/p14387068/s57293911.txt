                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 04:33
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with empyema, evaluate for change.
 
 Comparison to prior study, ___ at 12:20.
 
 A single portable erect chest film, ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 definitively identified on this examination.
 
 2.  There is a right-sided loculated pleural opacity, which most likely
 represents loculated fluid and does not appear to be significantly changed. 
 There is volume loss with shift of the mediastinum to the right and aeration
 of only a portion of the right lung.  A more focal oval consolidation in the
 left upper-to-mid lung is also seen suggestive of pneumonia, but is not
 significantly changed.  More patchy opacity at the left base may reflect other
 areas of pneumonia or patchy atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable
 given differences in positioning.
