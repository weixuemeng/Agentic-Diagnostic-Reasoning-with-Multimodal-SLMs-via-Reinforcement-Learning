                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with MRSA empyema decompensated cirrhosis with
 new pneumonia and acute shortness of breath.  Assess for worsening pneumonia
 or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube courses into the proximal duodenum and out of view.  Left PICC
 terminates in the mid-to-distal SVC.  A combination of opacity and lucency at
 the right base is compatible with known empyema and associated atelectasis. 
 Confluent opacification in the left lung is increased from the previous
 examination and likely reflects a combination of progressed new pneumonia as
 well as edema in the setting of increased right-sided opacities, prominent
 interstitial lines, and fullness of the pulmonary vessels.  The heart size is
 also slightly increased from the previous examination.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity of both lungs compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema superimposed on existing, perhaps slightly worsened, left sided
 pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged appearance to right basal empyema and accompanying atelectasis.
