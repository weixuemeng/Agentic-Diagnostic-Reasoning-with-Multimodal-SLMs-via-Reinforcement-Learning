                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis with pigtail placement.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Following thoracocentesis and pigtail catheter placement positioned at the
 right lung base, a large right pleural effusion has decreased but still at
 least moderate amount of right pleural fluid accompanying complete collapse of
 the right lower lobe and possibly at least partial collapse of the right upper
 lobe is persisting.  An ill-defined opacity in the left suprahilar region
 which was new on ___ radiograph is likely an aspiration pneumonia. 
 Left lower lung is clear.  Mild mediastinal shift to the left side owing to
 the right pleural effusion still persists, but better since yesterday.  There
 is no demonstrable pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Following thoracocentesis and right pigtail catheter placement,
 large right pleural effusion has decreased, but still at least moderate
 pleural effusion persists and accompanies complete collapse of the right lower
 lobe and possibly a partial collapse of the right upper lobe.
 
 Ill-defined left suprahilar opacity which was new on ___ is likely
 aspiration pneumonia.
