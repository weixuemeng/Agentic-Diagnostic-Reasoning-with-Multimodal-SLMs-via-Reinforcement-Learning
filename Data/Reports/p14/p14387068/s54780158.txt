                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hepatic hydrothorax, now status post
 right-sided pigtail placement, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest
 with contrast from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new right pigtail catheter in the right lower
 hemithorax.  The large right hydropneumothorax appears essentially unchanged
 from the prior exam within the limitations of technique.  Bilateral hazy
 opacification is suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  Focal opacity in left
 upper lobe is consistent with pneumonia and similar to the prior study.  NG
 tube is seen terminating in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right pigtail catheter.
 2.  No evidence for significant change in right hydropneumothorax.
 3.  Focal opacity in left upper lobe, most likely pneumonia.
 4.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
