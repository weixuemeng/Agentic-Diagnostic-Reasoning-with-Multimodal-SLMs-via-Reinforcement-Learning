                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph ___ at 18:39.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 6 cm from
 the carina.  An orogastric tube is with side port within the stomach.  There
 are low lung volumes.  The heart size is likely mildly enlarged.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  There is widening of the superior mediastinum likely due
 to supine technique and low lung volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present, but no definite pulmonary edema is noted.  Ill-defined
 patchy opacities are noted within the left upper lung field as well as both
 lower lung fields, which could reflect areas of  atelectasis, aspiration, or
 infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal and orogastric tubes in standard positions.
 2.  Ill-defined opacities in the left upper lung field as well as both lower
 lung fields.  Findings could reflect atelectasis, infection, or aspiration,
 and continued radiographic followup is advised.
