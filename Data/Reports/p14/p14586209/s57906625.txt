                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with back pain status post fall.  Evaluate for
 evidence of rib fracture or fracture of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are bibasilar reticular
 opacities with a more consolidated appearance in the left lower lung region,
 which obscures the left heart border.  There is some pleural thickening seen
 along the lateral aspect of the right lower lung.  No pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac size cannot be properly
 assessed due to obscuration of the left heart margin.  No rib fractures are
 identified. Diffuse decrease bone density is likely fom osteoporosis but no
 compression fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar reticular opacities, left worse than right, are
 compatible with interstitial lung disease.
