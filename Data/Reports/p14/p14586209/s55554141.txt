                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assessment for V/Q scan.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable with
 continued obscuration of the left heart border by left basilar reticular
 opacities.  The right base also remains stable in appearance with reticular
 opacities and pleural thickening. This appearance may be a combination of
 consolidation and honeycombing or honeycombing with emphysema. Paucity of
 vessels in the apices, especially on the right, is consistent with
 emphysematous changes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 no new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiograph with bibasilar interstitial abnormality.
 CT chest is recommended for further characterization. Given these parenchymal
 abnormalities, V/Q scan is likely to be limited. 
 
 Dr. ___ ___ the chest CT recommendation into the Critical Results
