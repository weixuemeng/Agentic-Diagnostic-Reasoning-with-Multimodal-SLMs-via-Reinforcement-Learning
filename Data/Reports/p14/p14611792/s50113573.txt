 changes are identified.  Allowing for differences in patient rotation, the the
 previously identified left upper lobe opacity is stable in size and
 appearance.  A focal, linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects
 scarring or atelectasis.  There is also stable scarring, atelectasis, or a
 small pleural effusion at the right costophrenic angle. There are
 calcifications within the wall of the aortic arch .  Bilateral hyper inflation
 is unchanged.  There is severe osteopenia and unchanged compression
 deformities of T11-T12.

 Unchanged appearance of left upper lobe mass.  No evidence of pneumonia.
