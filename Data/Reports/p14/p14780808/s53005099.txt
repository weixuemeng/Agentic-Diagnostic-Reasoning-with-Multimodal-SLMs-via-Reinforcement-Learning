                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, right lower lobe rhonchi.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the low SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Bronchiectasis with associated patchy opacity in the right lower
 lobe is similar compared to the recent CT.  Left lung is clear except for
 unchanged left upper lobe 8 mm pulmonary nodule.  Other previously seen
 pulmonary nodules on CT are not well assessed on the current radiograph.  No
 new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Right
 eleventh expansile lytic rib lesion is re- demonstrated.  Thoracolumbar
 fixation devices are re- demonstrated in the osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized unchanged appearance of compression deformities at the T10 and
 T11 vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lobe opacity with bronchiectasis, similar to the prior CT,
 which may reflect post radiation change or inflammation.  No new focal
 consolidation.  Similar appearance of right eleventh rib lytic metastasis.
