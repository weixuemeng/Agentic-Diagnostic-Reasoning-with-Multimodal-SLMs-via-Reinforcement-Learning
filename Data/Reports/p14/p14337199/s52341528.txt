                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever.
 
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 The only possible focal pulmonary abnormality is a 2 cm wide elliptical lesion
 projecting over the anterior aspect of the right sixth rib, which could be a
 calcification in the costosternal junction or a small lung nodule.  I would
 recommend shallow oblique views.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces are normal.
