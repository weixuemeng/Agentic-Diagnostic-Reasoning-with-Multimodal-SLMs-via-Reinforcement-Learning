                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and fatigue.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Substantial elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm anteriorly versus large pericardial cyst appears to be
 redemonstrated and unchanged since the prior study.  Large Morgagni hernia
 would be a possibility, although less likely.  Small amount of pleural
 effusion is noted.  Upper lungs are essentially clear and there is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small amount of pleural effusion which potentially can obscure lower lung
 pneumonia, followup of the patient in four weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy is recommended.
 
 Elevated right hemidiaphragm versus anterior mediastinal lesion, correlation
 with cross-sectional imaging might be considered if not obtained previously.
