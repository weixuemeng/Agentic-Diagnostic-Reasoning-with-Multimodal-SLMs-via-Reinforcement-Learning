                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with right chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes with crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures, with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  No definite
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Degenerative changes of the
 glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are noted bilaterally.  Mild
 degenerative changes are also seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture identified.  If there is continued
 clinical concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is suggested.
