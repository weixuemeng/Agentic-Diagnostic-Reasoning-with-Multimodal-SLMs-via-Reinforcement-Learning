 INDICATION:  Status post fall down five stairs, now complaining of left-sided
 pain.  Assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The bony
 thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 2.  No definite rib fracture identified.  If there is continued clinical
 concern for a rib fracture, further evaluation can be performed with a
 dedicated rib series, including an appropriately positioned radiopaque skin
 marker.
