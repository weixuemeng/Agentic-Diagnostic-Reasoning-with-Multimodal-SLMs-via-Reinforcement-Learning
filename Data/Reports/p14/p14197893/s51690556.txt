                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and left lower lobe abnormal breath sounds.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is left lower lobe consolidation associated with potentially minimal
 amount of pleural effusion, consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia,
 corresponding to the physical examination.  Rest of the lungs are clear.  The
 heart size is slightly enlarged but stable.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 There is questionable left upper lobe nodular opacity which potentially might
 reflect additional focus of infection, but should be followed in four weeks
 after completion of antibiotic therapy for documentation of entire resolution
 of the abnormality.
