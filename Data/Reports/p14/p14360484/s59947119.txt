 now with fevers  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam is limited by low lung volumes, scoliosis and suboptimal positioning. 
 With this limitation in mind, cardiomediastinal contours are grossly within
 normal limits.  Lungs are clear except for predominately linear opacities at
 the left base favoring atelectasis over infectious pneumonia.  Surgical clips
 in the upper paratracheal region may reflect previous thyroid surgery.
