                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation at OSH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 5.4 cm from the carina.
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  There is mild
 cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Hazy and patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis with small right pleural effusions. No  pneumothorax is
 identified. No displaced rib fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position. Patchy and hazy bibasilar opacities,
 potentially atelectasis with small layering pleural effusions, though
 infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
