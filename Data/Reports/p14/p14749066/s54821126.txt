                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Perihilar
 opacities are seen, raising concern for pulmonary edema.  However, there are
 also increased opacities at the right perihilar and right infrahilar/right
 basilar regions, right greater than left, which could relate to fluid
 overload; however, superimposed multifocal infectious process is not excluded.
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There appears to be mild prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery which may be due to a component of underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perihilar, infrahilar, and bibasilar opacities may be due to
 fluid overload, but superimposed multifocal infectious process is not
 excluded.  Recommend repeat after diuresis.  There may also be subtle opacity
 at the right upper lobe.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.
