                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD p/w stroke and COPD exacerbation  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 16:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly and evidence of background COPD.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora and mild vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.
 
 More focal opacities are seen at both lung bases and could represent either
 atelectasis or infectious/inflammatory opacities.  Allowing for technical
 differences, these are similar to the prior film.
 
 Blunting of the  costophrenic angles raises the possibility of small
 left-greater-than-right pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.
 
 Rectangular density superimposed over the lower thoracic spine likely reflects
 methylmethacrylate (segment) related to prior kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. 
 Curvilinear density superimposed over mid thoracic vertebral body may also
 represent methylmethacrylate.  Curvilinear vascular calcification is
 considered less likely.
 
 Carotid artery calcification also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and CHF with interstitial edema and suspected small bilateral
 effusions.
 
 Patchy opacities at both lung bases, similar to the study from 1 day earlier. 
 While this could represent atelectasis and/or scarring, infectious/
 inflammatory opacities are not excluded.  Differential diagnosis also includes
 changes related to aspiration pneumonitis.  This appearance is new compared
 with the chest x-ray from ___.
