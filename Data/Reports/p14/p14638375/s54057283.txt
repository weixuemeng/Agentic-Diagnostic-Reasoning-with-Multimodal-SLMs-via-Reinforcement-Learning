                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, new onset.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some improvement in
 the opacification at the left base, though there is still residual pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  The large
 left thyroid goiter again compresses and displaces the lower cervical trachea.
