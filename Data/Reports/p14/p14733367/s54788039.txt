                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent admission to outside hospital for pneumonia.  Symptoms
 improved with treatment, but has persistent hallucinations.  Evaluate for
 worsening or new infiltrate on chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single AP radiograph of the chest was obtained.  Moderate-to-severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed.  There is
 pulmonary venous congestion with predominantly perihilar and right lower lung
 heterogeneous opacities as well as Kerley B lines, most consistent with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Given the slight asymmetry of the opacities at
 the right lung base, a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 There may be a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic in nature given
 moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Possible small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base could be atelectasis,
 although an infectious process cannot be excluded.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful to evaluate further if clinically indicated.
