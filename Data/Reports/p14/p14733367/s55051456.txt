                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Psychosis and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is increasing relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which apparently accompanies increasing
 posterior basilar volume loss and probably a pleural effusion.  In addition to
 perihilar fullness and haziness, there is moderate interstitial abnormality
 suggesting pulmonary edema.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the
 left or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Volume loss and suspected pleural effusion in the right lower lobe with
 increased relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  This appearance may
 be due to sequelae of cardiac failure with atelectasis, but an infectious
 etiology is not excluded by this study.
