                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate lung opacities.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There has been interval improvement of now mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Bilateral perihilar opacities larger on the left side
 likely consistent with pneumonia have only minimally improved.  Right pleural
 effusion is small.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is in the low
 SVC.
