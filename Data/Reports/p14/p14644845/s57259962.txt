                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with rhonchi in the right lungs and upper
 respiratory infection symptoms with cough.  History of pneumonia twice this
 year.  Remote history of breast cancer with right mastectomy and radiation
 therapy.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is confluent increased opacity
 in the right lung apex. The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal. The hila are
 prominent bilaterally and there is also apparent enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery contour.  The patient is status post right mastectomy with
 reconstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right apical opacity could reflect pneumonia. However, given the remote
 history of radiation therapy, radiation fibrosis is an additional
 consideration.
 
 2.  Prominent hila and enlarged main pulmonary artery contour, possibly
 reflecting pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the absence of prior CXR, it is
 difficult to exclude lymphadenopathy.
 
 Contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended for further evaluation of the above
 findings.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 2:45 pm on ___, via telephone.
