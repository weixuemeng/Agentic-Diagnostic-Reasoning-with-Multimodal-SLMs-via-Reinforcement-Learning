                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and heart failure  // r/o worsening
 edema and consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of ___, interstitial edema has resolved.
 Faint opacity at right lung apex is probably due to summation of normal
 structures, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for
 more complete assessment of this region when the patient's condition permits.
