 aortic knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are demonstrated, larger on the right, not substantially changed in

 however assessment of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's
 neck and chin overlying these regions.  Patient is status post right shoulder
 arthroplasty.
