                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, shortness of breath, CHF,
 evaluate for infiltrates or worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Previously described cardiac enlargement
 persists and may even have increased slightly identified on the frontal views.
 Appearance of thoracic aorta unchanged.  The pulmonary vascular congestive
 pattern with upper zone re-distribution persists.  It has, however, not
 progressed to interstitial or alveolar edema, and there is still no evidence
 of any significant pleural effusion accumulating in the lateral or posterior
 pleural sinuses.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  No new discrete local
 parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic character have developed.
 
 Persistent cardiac enlargement as well as persistent evidence of chronic
 congestion.  No interstitial or alveolar edema has developed, and no pleural
 effusion has accumulated.  Continued treatment with emphasis on fluid
 reduction recommended.
