                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of shortness of breath,
 recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval decrease in previously seen right lung patchy opacities with
 smaller residual opacity persisting in the right mid-to-lower lung zone.  The
 left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a
 trace right pleural effusion may be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in previously seen patchy right pulmonary
 opacities, most consistent with resolving multifocal pneumonia.
