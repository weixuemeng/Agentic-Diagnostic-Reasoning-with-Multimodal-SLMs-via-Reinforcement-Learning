                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  There are linear areas of opacity
 in the right base likely reflecting atelectasis.  No focal airspace opacity is
 detected to suggest pneumonia.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Atelectasis at the right base but no evidence of pneumonia.
