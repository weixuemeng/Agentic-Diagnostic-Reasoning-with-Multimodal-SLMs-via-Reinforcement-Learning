                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with left-sided rib fractures ___ 6
 through 9.  Evaluate left-sided rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Available for comparison is the next preceding single AP chest view
 of ___.  On the frontal view, poor inspirational effort explains
 relatively high positioned diaphragms and low lung volume.  Crowded appearance
 of pulmonary vasculature on the bases, but no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 infiltrates.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any
 fluid accumulations and there is no evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  The heart size is mildly enlarged or at the upper limit of normal
 variation.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified.  The thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated as it was before.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  A deformity in the proximal left humerus
 indicative of a fracture, is the cause of patient's inability to elevate the
 arm for the lateral view.  Identification of the ribs is therefore very
 limited.  On the frontal view, one see mild deformities of the left lower
 ribs, but no acute fracture or clear dislocation can be identified.  Thus, the
 ribs are stable, considering comparison on the plain chest examinations. 
 Review of a chest CT performed on ___ reveals even now noticed
 left humeral neck fracture, three angulated deformities of left anterior ribs,
 probably 7 through 9 and a known displaced old non-united right lateral tenth
 rib fracture.  Follow assessment of these rib fractures in detail would
 require repeated chest CT, which at this time could not be expected to show
 significant healing.  Comparison of the plain frontal chest views shows that
 the findings are stable and no pneumothorax or pleural effusion has developed.
