                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with intubation, assess tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph obtained one hour prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable radiograph is obtained.  Endotracheal tube is
 satisfactorily positioned within the trachea.  Examination was slightly
 limited by motion with bilateral atelectasis and low lung volumes.  No
 pneumothorax is seen with exaggeration of heart and mediastinal size likely
 due to supine positioning. Old clavicular fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
