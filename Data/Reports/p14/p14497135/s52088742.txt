                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall from standing, knocked out front tooth, question
 tooth in lung.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Multiple surgical clips are seen
 overlying the cardiac silhouette and mediastinum.  There is a 3-mm radiopaque
 density projecting over the left cardiac silhouette on the frontal view only,
 not well substantiated on the lateral view, may represent post-surgical
 change/clips, although tooth is not excluded.  Consider oblique views for
 further evaluation.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Patient is status post cardiac valve replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  3-mm radiopaque structure projecting over the cardiac silhouette
 at left lower hemithorax could be post-surgical, although cannot exclude
 tooth; consider oblique radiograph for further evaluation.
