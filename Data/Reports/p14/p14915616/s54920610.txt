 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation. Slight
 blunting of the costophrenic angle is felt to be more likely due to
 atelectasis rather than trace pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles
 felt to more likely be due to atelectasis rather than trace pleural effusions.
