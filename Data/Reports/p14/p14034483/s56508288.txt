                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypertension, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT of the chest dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior chest radiographs.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, similar to
 prior CT.  There is associated right basilar atelectasis.  No significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 seen with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are exaggerated due to low lung volumes.  Within
 this limitation, there is no significant change from the prior study allowing
 for low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with right basilar atelectasis.
