                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  On chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, presenting with abdominal pain
 and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from a recent CT torso performed on ___
 can be used for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is similar mild relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Streaky right posterior basilar opacities are compatible with
 minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable aside from mild degenerative changes which are unchanged along
 the mid to lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
