                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post assault with right scapular pain and chest
 pain.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no rib
 fractures are identified, this study has suboptimal sensitivity for the
 detection of rib fractures.  If there is further clinical concern, dedicated
 rib views should be performed.
