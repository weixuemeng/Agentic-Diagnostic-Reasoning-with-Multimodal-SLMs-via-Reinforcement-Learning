                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Again seen is the opacity in the left lower
 lobe measuring approximately 2.4 x 1.7 cm, of uncertain etiology.  This may be
 a calcification at the costochondral junction however pulmonary nodule cannot
 be ruled out. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Again seen is nodular opacity
 in the left lower lobe adjacent to the left heart border.  This may be a
 calcification at the costochondral junction however pulmonary nodule cannot be
 excluded. Consider nonemergent CT chest for further evaluation.
