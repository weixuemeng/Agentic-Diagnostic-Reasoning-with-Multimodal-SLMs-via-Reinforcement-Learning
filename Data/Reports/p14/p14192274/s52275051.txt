                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a
 fracture of the posterior lateral right 7th rib of indeterminate age but there
 appears to be slight surrounding callus indicating that it is likely at least
 subacute.  Underlying atelectasis is seen without definite focal
 consolidation.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.  Some
 degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right posterior lateral 7th rib fracture of indeterminate age, but suggestion
 of some surrounding at slight callus suggests that this is most likely at
 least subacute.  Correlate with history and pain at this location.  Underlying
 mild streaky opacity may be due to atelectasis.
 
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
