 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with one week of cough and fever on the Z-Pak,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Blunting of the

 thickening.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or signs of edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusions versus pleural thickening
 accounting for blunted CP angles bilaterally.  No signs of pneumonia.
