                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement, ? pulmonary process that could be
 responsible for hypertrophic osteoarthritis seen on foot XR.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval placement of a right-sided PICC line.  Per IV
 nursing, the wire is pulled back roughly 3 cm from the tip of the catheter. 
 This will place the tip at the level of the mid SVC.  Lungs are well expanded.
 Heart is borderline normal in size.  Lungs are clear with no evidence of focal
 infiltrate.  No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
