 hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Appearing centered in the peripheral right anterior lung is a small cluster of
 irregular metallic densities measuring up to 2 mm; additionally, a more
 well-defined, approximately 13 mm oblong radiodensity is seen appearing
 centered in the right flank soft tissues.  These may represent embedded
 shrapnel.
