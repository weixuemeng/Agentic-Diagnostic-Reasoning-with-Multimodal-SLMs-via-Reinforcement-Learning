                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a dense left upper lobe opacity extending from the hilum.  There may
 be accompanying volume loss in the left upper lobe which is possibly reflected
 in mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right.  
 
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense left upper lobe opacity with suspected volume loss. 
 Although this may reflect dense consolidative pneumonia, findings at least
 raise concern for the possibility of an underlying mass with associated
 pneumonitis as a possible alternative diagnosis.  If pneumonia is suspected
 clinically, then short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered as
 follow-up management to show a trend toward resolution within a few weeks.  
 
 a few weeks.  Otherwise, particularly if pneumonia does not appear likely as
 the explanation clinically, then chest CT should be considered, preferably
 with intravenous contrast, if feasible.
