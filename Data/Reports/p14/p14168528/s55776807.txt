                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with a history of HTN, DMII, obesity and prior gluteal
 fold abscess presenting with gluteal fold swelling. // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Greater opacification of the right hemi thorax is probably due to a
 posteriorly layering moderate right pleural effusion.  The very wide
 mediastinum. could be due to fatty infiltration and mediastinal venous
 engorgement, but I cannot exclude hematoma or adenopathy on this single view
 alone. Heart is moderately enlarged. Pulmonary edema is mild to moderate. No
 pneumothorax.
