                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of new pacemaker lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Evaluation of the lateral view is limited due to patient arm
 positioning.  A new left pectoral pacer has leads ending in the expected
 locations of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Sternal fixation wires are
 aligned and intact.  Hyperinflated lungs and flattening of the hemidiaphragms
 is suggestive of emphysema.  The lungs are clear and there is no pneumothorax.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are minimal if present.  The heart size has
 decreased since ___ and is now top normal. The mediastinal contours are
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left pectoral pacer has leads ending in the expected locations of the
 right atrium and right ventricle without evidence of complication including
 pneumothorax.
 2.  The cardiac size has decreased since ___ and is now top normal.
 3.  Hyperinflated lungs and flattened hemidiaphrgams are suggestive of
 emphysema.
 4.  Bilateral pleural effusions are minimal if present.
