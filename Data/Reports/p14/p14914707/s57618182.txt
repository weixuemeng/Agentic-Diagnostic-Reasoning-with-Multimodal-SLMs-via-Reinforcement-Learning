 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, unknown origin, evaluation for aspiration
 or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The pre-existing bilateral areas of multifocal parenchymal
 opacities, strongly suggestive of multifocal pneumonia, have minimally
 increased in extent and severity.  This increase is more obvious on the left
 than on the right.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  No
 larger pleural effusions on the frontal or the lateral radiograph.  The
 nasogastric tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax.
