                                 FINAL REPORT
 An unresponsive patient status post intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates an
 endotracheal tube terminating appropriately in the mid trachea, approximately
 5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube traverses the esophagus, enters the
 stomach, and passes inferiorly out of the field of view.  There are bilateral
 perihilar opacities and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature.  The
 heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube in the mid trachea.
 2.  Likely pulmonary edema.  An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.
