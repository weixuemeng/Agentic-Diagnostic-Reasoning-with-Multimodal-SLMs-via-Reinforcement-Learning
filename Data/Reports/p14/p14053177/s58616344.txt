                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe dyspnea, on amiodarone, evaluate for interstitial
 pneumonitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and CT chest on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  A left-sided pacemaker/AICD is
 in appropriate position.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 There is an increase in perihilar opacities and interlobular septal thickening
 with predominantly basilar and peripheral opacities bilaterally, this is most
 consistent with pulmonary edema, however given the clinical history, this can
 also be seen in amiodarone toxicity. Previously seen small nodules are not as
 well seen on chest radiograph.   No pneumothorax.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema, however given the
 clinical history, this can also be seen in amiodarone toxicity.
