                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen, unchanged in position.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Haziness of the hila with perihilar opacities are
 again seen, somewhat similar to prior, which may be due to pulmonary edema;
 however, as also noted on the prior, amiodarone toxicity is also in the
 differential.  Bibasilar and peripheral right mid lung and left mid to lower
 lung opacities are again seen, as was also the case on the prior study. 
 Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes seen on chest CT from ___ are better
 assessed on that study.
 
 There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax, but there may
 be trace fluid tracking along a fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar to findings as compared to prior chest radiograph,
 perhaps increased opacity along the left lateral mid to lower lung.  Central
 opacities may be in part due to underlying pulmonary edema; however, there may
 also be a component of amiodarone toxicity or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
 as described on the recent prior chest CT.
