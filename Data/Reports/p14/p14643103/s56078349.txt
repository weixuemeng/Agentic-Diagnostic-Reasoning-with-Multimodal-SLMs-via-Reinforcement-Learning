                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with ett  // eval for ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemi thorax.  In combination with
 left-sided volume loss and surgical clips, findings are suggestive of prior
 left pneumonectomy.  Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 2.8 cm from the
 expected region of the carina which is not well visualized.  Hazy opacity
 projects over the right lung.  This could represent a combination of infection
 edema or layering effusion.  Right-sided central venous catheter projects to
 the left of midline, exact location is difficult to assess given altered
 anatomy.  Cardiac silhouette for similar reasons cannot be assessed.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube likely in appropriate position although delineating anatomic detail is
 difficult as detailed above.  Probable prior left pneumonectomy.  Right-sided
 parenchymal opacities could represent edema and/or infection.
