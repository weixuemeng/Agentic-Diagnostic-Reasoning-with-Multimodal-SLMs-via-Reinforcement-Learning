                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left sided pneumonectomy, with hypoxemia 
 // eval for pulm edema, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs performed between ___
 and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right central venous catheter is unchanged in appearance, terminating at the
 origin of the SVC.  The enteric and endotracheal tubes have been removed in
 the interim.
 
 Diffuse interstitial markings in the right lung are more pronounced at the
 lung base, gradually improving compared to the initial radiograph on ___.  This could reflect either resolving viral pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 No new consolidation.
 
 Post-pneumonectomy changes on the left are stable.  Of note, leftward shift of
 the mediastinum and right lung are more pronounced than expected after
 pneumonectomy in adulthood.  This can be seen in the setting of left mainstem
 bronchus compromise.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Gradually improving pulmonary edema or viral pneumonia in the right lung. 
 No new consolidation.
 2. Pronounced leftward shift of the right lung and mediastinum post
 pneumonectomy, which can be seen in the setting of right mainstem bronchus
 compromise (post-pneumonectomy syndrome).
