  1. New enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of
  view within the massively distended stomach.
  2. Multiple distended loops of small bowel in the right upper quadrant are
  better evaluated by recent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
  3. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with new NG tube placement, evaluate positioning of NG tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view radiograph of the chest and abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of
 view within the massively distended stomach.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited
 as the apices are excluded from the field of view.  Surgical clips project
 over the left upper quadrant.  Posterior spinal fusion hardware is partially
 imaged.  Chronic appearing left-sided rib deformities are related to prior
 fracture.  In addition to the massively distended, multiple distended loops of
 small bowel fill the upper abdomen.
