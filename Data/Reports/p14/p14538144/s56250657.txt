                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma, developed fever and hypotension.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 An indwelling right-sided catheter is present, tip over upper right atrium. 
 In addition, a right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC.  These are
 both unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette suggests mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Compared with
 the prior study, some patchy opacity and a small left effusion at the left
 base are new --  the possibility of an early infectious infiltrate in this
 area is considered.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate.  No right-sided effusion.
