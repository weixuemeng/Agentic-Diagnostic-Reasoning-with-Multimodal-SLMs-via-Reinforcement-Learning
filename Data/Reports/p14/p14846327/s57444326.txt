                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an infrahilar opacity partly obscuring the left cardiac
 border suggesting opacities in the lingula and left lower lobe probably due to
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  No free air is demonstrated.  There are a few
 air-fluid levels projecting over the left upper quadrant, probably in the
 colon although not optimally assessed, with dense dependent portions
 suggesting recent contrast administration or ingestion of other hyperdense
 substance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected minor atelectasis at the left lung base.  No free air
 identified.  Few air-fluid levels in the left upper quadrant, probably
 colonic, with suspected recent enteric contrast administration; correlation
 with any recent contrast administration is suggested.
