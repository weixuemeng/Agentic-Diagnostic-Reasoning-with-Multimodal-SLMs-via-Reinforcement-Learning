                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.  Continued asymmetric
 opacification at the right base posteriorly.  Although this most likely
 reflects atelectasis, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 The pulmonary vascularity has improved since previous study.
