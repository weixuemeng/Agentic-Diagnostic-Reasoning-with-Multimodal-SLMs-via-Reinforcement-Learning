  Retrocardiac opacification and blunting of the left costophrenic angle
  suggests small left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis or
  consolidation in the appropriate clinical context.  Blunting of right
  costophrenic angle compatible with trace right pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
  edema.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure, COPD and cirrhosis,
 assessment of shortness of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are assessed demonstrating cardiomegaly as well as
 prominence of the azygos vein that might potentially reflect vascular
 engorgement.  There is left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. 
 The findings might reflect atelectasis, but infectious process in this area is
 a possibility.  The right infrahilar opacity is still most likely represent
 engorgement of the vessels but focus of infection can be present as well. 
 Comparison with prior studies would be beneficial.
