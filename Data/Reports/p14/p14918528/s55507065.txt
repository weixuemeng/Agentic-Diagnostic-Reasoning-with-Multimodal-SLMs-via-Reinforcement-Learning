                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well-expanded lungs.
 Cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.  Focal opacities in the
 right mid and lower lung could represent infection. Blunting of posterior
 costophrenic angles suggest small effusions.   No pneumothorax. Tube-like
 opacity projecting over the right costophrenic sulcus is thought to be
 external.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Focal opacity in the right mid and lower lung could represent infection. 
 Possible small effusions.
