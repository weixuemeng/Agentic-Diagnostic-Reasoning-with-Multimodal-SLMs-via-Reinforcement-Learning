                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tachypnea.  // Eval for volume overload vs
 PNA      Eval for volume overload vs PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are low lung
 volumes with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  Although this most
 likely represents substantial pulmonary edema more prominent on the right, the
 coalescence of opacification on the right is worrisome for superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
