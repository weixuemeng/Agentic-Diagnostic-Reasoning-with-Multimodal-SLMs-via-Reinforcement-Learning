                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG // eval for pneumothorax s/p CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube and enteric tube have been removed.  Right internal
 jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 The heart is minimally enlarged from the prior exam.  The mediastinum is also
 minimally widened which may reflect a postoperative appearance and recent
 extubation.  Lung volumes are markedly low.  Left basal opacity suggests
 atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or appreciable pneumothorax.  Mild
 vascular congestion without edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly low lung volumes.  Widened mediastinum is most likely related to
 recent procedure and recent extubation/ removal of positive pressure
 ventilatory support.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Findings discussed with ___ on ___ at
 11:50 by Dr. ___.
