                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with repair of a large hiatal hernia on ___,
 who now presents with shortness of breath, evaluate for stable postoperative
 state and resolution of postop seroma.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest with and without constructions ___, PA
 and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted.  Cardiac silhouette is
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  There has been resolution of the previously
 noted right soft tissue density along the right heart border representing
 hematoma/seroma.  Linear atelectasis is noted within the left lung base.  A
 tiny rounded opacity projecting over the left lung base likely represents
 residual focus of atelectasis (prior CTA chest demonstrated pleural effusion
 and atelectasis in this region).
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Resolution of the soft tissue density along the right heart border
 representing seroma/hematoma.
 2. Tiny rounded opacity projecting over the left lung base likely represents
 residual focus of atelectasis (prior CTA chest demonstrated pleural effusion
 and atelectasis in this region). However, 
 recommend a follow up radiograph in 3 months to document resolution.
 
 Findings were posted to the radiology communication dashboard on ___ at
 13:58.
