 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset tachypnea  // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a
 relatively large perihilar opacity on the left, suspicious to reflect
 pneumonia.  The radial transparency of the right lung base has shown on going
 improvement, with only a remnant right basilar atelectasis. Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax.  The right PICC line has been slightly
 pulled back and now projects over the mid to lower SVC.
