 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis, s/p fluid resuscitation  // interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged and accompanied by widening of the vascular pedicle
 and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Within this context, asymmetrically
 distributed. Hilar and basilar opacities worse on the left than the right
 probably reflect asymmetrical edema although coexisting process such as
 aspiration or infection are also possible. Right hemidiaphragm is moderately
 elevated of uncertain chronicity in the absence of older radiographs for
 comparison.
