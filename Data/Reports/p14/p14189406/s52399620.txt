                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient intubated, eval ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in
 supine position.
 
 The ET tube has been advanced and the tip now terminates 3.4 cm above the
 carina.  The remaining support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Lung volumes remain low.  An area of increased opacity is present
 in the right lung base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube in appropriate position with the tip at 3.5 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Increased opacity in the right lung base, likely reflective of atelectasis
 and bronchovascular crowding, but will require attention on followup
 radiographs.
