                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma, fevers, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is atelectasis and/or scarring at both
 bases, similar to ___ -- no interval change is identified.  No focal
 infiltrate is seen.  The aorta is tortuous.  Clips are noted over the trachea
 at the level of the thoracic inlet.  There is upper zone redistribution, but
 no overt CHF.  No effusion.
 
 Lucency and expansion involving the lateral portion of the right clavicle and
 nonvisualization of the medial portion of the right clavicle is consistent
 with involvement by myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis or scarring, unchanged x 2 days.  No focal
 infiltrate identified.
 
 2.  UZRD without overt CHF.
 
 3.  Lytic areas in right clavicle, consistent with known myeloma.
