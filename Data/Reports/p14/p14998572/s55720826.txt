                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Palpitations, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating clear
 well expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Haziness along the right and left heart border is unchanged and most likely
 reflects the presence of epicardial fat pads.  Tiny clips are noted in the
 superior mediastinum, likely related to prior thyroidectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
