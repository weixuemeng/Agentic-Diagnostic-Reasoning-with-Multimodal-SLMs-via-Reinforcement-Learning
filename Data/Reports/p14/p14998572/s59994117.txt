                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple myeloma with fever.  Assess for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show bibasilar lower lobe opacities.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Note is made of near complete lucency of
 the mid right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Lucency of the medial clavicle is unchanged, likely represents
 myelomatous involvement.
