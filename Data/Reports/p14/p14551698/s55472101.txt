                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic cancer unknown primary PEs with
 persistent oxygen requirement.  // pulmonary edema? PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from___ at 01:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 01:29 , small right and left effusions are new
 or better seen.  A small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening is also
 seen along the lower lateral right chest wall.
 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation, though confluence
 at the right lung base makes it difficult to exclude an early pneumonic
 infiltrate or focus of aspiration.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 There is hyperinflation, consistent with background COPD.
 
 Linear lucency overlies the left third posterior rib.  While this most likely
 represents artifact due to multiple overlapping structures, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, a nondisplaced rib fracture could give rise to this
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right-greater-than- left pleural effusions are new or larger compared
 with ___.
 
 No definite consolidation, but confluent opacity at the right lung base makes
 it difficult to exclude an early pneumonic infiltrate or focus of aspiration.
 
 Linear lucency overlying left third posterior rib --___ artifact due to
 overlapping structures.  If the patient has focal tenderness in this location,
 the nondisplaced rib fracture would be considered.
 
 Upper zone redistribution.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
