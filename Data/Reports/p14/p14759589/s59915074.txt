                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, presumably related
 to the recent surgical procedure.  Marked dilatation of gas-filled loops of
 bowel are seen in the abdomen.
 
 Relatively low lung volumes but no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.  Mild atelectatic changes at the bases.
