 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with worsening shortness of breath, question
 change of prior.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 1:00 a.m.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 Compared with the earlier film, overall appearance is similar. Again seen is
 severe COPD with extensive parenchymal scarring.  Known pneumomediastinum 
 remains relatively subtle radiographically.   Subcutaneous emphysema over the
 right supraclavicular region is now more apparent.  Trace curvilinear lucency
 noted along the cardiac apex.  No pneumothorax identified. No free air seen
 beneath the diaphgrams. Mediastinum remains midline.
