                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure and sepsis, intubated 
 // Interval change      Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits.  The
 bibasilar opacifications are less prominent, though this could merely reflect
 a more upright position of the patient rather than improvement in pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Left hemidiaphragm is again obscured, consistent
 with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
