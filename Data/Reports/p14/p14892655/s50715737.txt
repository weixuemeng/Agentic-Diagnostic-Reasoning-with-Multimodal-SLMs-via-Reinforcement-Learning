 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 07:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright chest radiograph ___ at 05:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and bilateral internal jugular central lines are unchanged
 in position.  Status post median sternotomy for valve replacement with stable
 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Slightly worsening diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal process, but more focally in the left upper lobe and at
 both bases.  Although this may represent a worsening infectious process, this
 all could be related to progression of pulmonary and interstitial edema. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.  No pneumothorax.
