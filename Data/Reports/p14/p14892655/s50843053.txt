                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acutely dropping O2 sats  // Any interval
 change?      Any interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are lower lung
 volumes with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, pulmonary edema,
 in bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis on both
 sides.  Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 The monitoring and support devices appear stable.
