                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumothorax, significant for
 metastatic lung cancer, admitted with dyspnea and increasing right pleural
 effusion, now status post chest tube removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  During the examination interval, the
 previously present right-sided pigtail and pleural drainage catheter has been
 removed.  The previously described extensive parenchymal and interstitial
 densities occupying the right mid and lower lung zone remain rather unchanged.
 No new or reoccurring pneumothorax can be identified in the right apical area.
 Appearance of heart contours is unaltered and thus no evidence of significant
 cardiac enlargement.  This matches the absence of any pulmonary vascular
 congestion in the left hemithorax.  Left-sided basal peripheral plate
 atelectasis has developed, but no other new significant local abnormalities
 are seen.
