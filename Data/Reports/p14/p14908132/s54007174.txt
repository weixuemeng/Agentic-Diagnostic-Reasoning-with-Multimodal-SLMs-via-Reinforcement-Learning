 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer with right pleural effusion and plan for
 thoracentesis, now with severe shortness of breath, here to evaluate for
 worsening pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is increased
 opacification of the right mid and lower lung zones compatible with a large
 pleural effusion.  Known hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better
 characterized on PET-CT of ___.  The left lung is relatively clear
 with stable areas of parenchymal scarring and scattered calcified pleural
 plaques.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of large right pleural effusion with right lung
 opacification suggesting atelectasis or consolidation.
