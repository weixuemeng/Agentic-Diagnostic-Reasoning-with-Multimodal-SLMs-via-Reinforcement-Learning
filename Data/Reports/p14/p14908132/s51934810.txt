 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a status post

 bases, right more than left, are constant.  There is no evidence of newly
 appeared opacities or increasing pleural effusion.  The extent of the pleural
 and parenchymal changes is also constant on the lateral view.  No change in
 appearance of the heart and the mediastinum.  No acute changes such as
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
