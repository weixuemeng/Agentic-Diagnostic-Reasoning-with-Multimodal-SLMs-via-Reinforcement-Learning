                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer with a pericardial effusion status
 post drainage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed
 from the prior exam.  Bibasilar consolidations are likely a combination of
 edema and atelectasis, and are also unchanged.  There is no new consolidation.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac size has slightly decreased since the
 prior exam.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  The pericardial drain is
 not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable bilateral moderate pleural effusions with associated atelectasis
 and dependent edema.
 2.  Slight decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette.
