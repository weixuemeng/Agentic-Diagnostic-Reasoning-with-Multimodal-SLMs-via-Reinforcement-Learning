                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known lung cancer, now with cough, increased sputum and worsening
 dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the most recent prior study, the chronic pleural and
 parenchymal changes at the bilateral lower lung zones on the right greater
 than the left appear unchanged.  There is increased opacification at the left
 lung base from ___.  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Small pleural effusions are likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left basilar opacification may represent atelectasis;
 however, focal consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 context.
