                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and more recent PET-CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the previous chest x-ray of ___, a right pleural
 effusion has substantially increased it size. It is now moderate to large and
 apparently partially loculated laterally.  Although only a small amount of
 pleural fluid was present on the prior chest x-ray, a more recent PET-CT of
 ___, demonstrated a moderate amount of right pleural fluid.  Direct
 comparison to the PET CT is difficult due to positional differences, but the
 effusion likely has increased in size further since that time.  Known right
 mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy have been better characterized on the
 recent PET-CT.  Worsening lung opacities in the right middle and right lower
 lobe are present. On the left, nonspecific areas of parenchymal scarring are
 present as well as scattered calcified pleural plaques, not substantially
 changed from the prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large, partially loculated right pleural effusion,
 with adjacent right middle and lower lobe opacities, which could reflect
 atelectasis or infectious consolidation.  A post-obstructive process from
 known right hilar abnormality is an additional consideration.  
 
 Findings have been communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ ___ at 9:15
 a.m. on ___.
