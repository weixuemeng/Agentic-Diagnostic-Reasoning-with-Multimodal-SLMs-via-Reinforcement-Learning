                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with two-month history of productive cough, here
 to evaluate for pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and CT of
 the chest last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show stable scarring
 at the peripheral right lung.  A possible new nodule projecting peripherally
 between the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs is not identified on the
 preceding radiograph.  Multiple bilateral opacities corresponding to known
 calcified pleural plaques are unchanged and consistent with asbestos exposure.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  The aortic knob is
 partially calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible new pulmonary nodule in the peripheral right upper lobe.  A
 followup CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 2.  Multiple bilateral pleural plaques and scarring of the right mid lung is
 grossly unchanged.
 
 Findings were posted by Dr. ___ to the critical results dashboard for
 communication to Dr. ___  at 7:30pm on ___.
