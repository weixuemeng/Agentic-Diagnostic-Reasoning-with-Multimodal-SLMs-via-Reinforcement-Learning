 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:27 PM
  Increased bilateral pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis. Additional
  new bilateral lower lung consolidations are slightly greater than expected for
  compressive atelectasis in the setting of effusions, are non-specific, and may
  represent pneumonia, aspiration, dependent edema, or hemorrhage.
  Alternatively, this could be exaggerated by layering fluid. Continued follow-
  up is recommended. Pericardial catheter is difficult to follow on this study;
  clinical correlation for output is recommended. Discussed with ___
  by phone at 9:25 p.m. on ___ at time of initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of non-small cell lung cancer.  Status post
 pericardiocentesis.  New increasing oxygen requirement and shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the bilateral pleural effusions have slightly
 increased in size.  Associated bibasilar consolidations are new and most
 likely represent a combination of new edema and atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is severely enlarged and not significantly
 changed from prior exam.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Notably, the
 vascular pedicle has not increased in width to suggest progression of
 tamponade physiology.  A pericardial drain is seen overlying the cardiac
 silhouette, although the tip of the catheter is not well seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Increasing basilar opacities are most likely edema and atelectasis.
 3.  Stable, large pericardial effusion despite new pericardial drain.  No
 evidence of progressive cardiac tamponade.   
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:25 p.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
