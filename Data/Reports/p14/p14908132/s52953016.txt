                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer, followup pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ in conjunction with the PET-CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared with the most recent prior radiograph, the left pleural effusion has
 improved, with a persistent small residual effusion.  There is unchanged
 appearance of a moderate right pleural effusion.  Right mid and bilateral
 lower lung linear opacities are consistent with scarring.  Calcified pleural
 plaques are unchanged.  The heart size is unchanged.  Widening of the right
 peritracheal stripe and prominence of the right hila are consistent with
 lymphadenopathy seen on previous PET-CT.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement in small left pleural effusion; no change in moderate right
 effusion.
