 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a mild
 bilateral, right more than left, pleural effusions with subsequent areas of
 atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases.  These changes,
 however, might be emphasized by lower lung volumes, likely caused by a lesser
 inspiratory effort.
 
 Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  Known left lung calcifications.  No evidence
 of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
