                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right mid to
 lower lung opacity persists, but has decreased in the interval with slight
 improvement in aeration in this region.  There are stable calcific nodular
 densities particularly in the left upper to mid hemithorax, which are
 consistent with calcified pleural plaques.  Small right pleural effusion.  No
 focal consolidation or large pleural effusion is seen on the left.
