                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer.  Status post pericardiocentesis with
 increasing shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___, and multiple chest radiographs dating to ___.  ___,
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since the prior radiograph obtained approximately 8 hours
 earlier, moderate pleural effusions and the combination of edema and
 atelectasis at the lung bases are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable but the width of the
 mediastinum at the vascular pedicle has decreased slightly.  A pericardial
 drain is noted overlying the heart, although difficult to evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in bilateral moderate effusions and dependent edema
 and atelectasis.
 2.  Persistent large pericardial effusion. Slight decrease in size of the
 vascular pedicle suggests a decrease in central venous volume or receding
 cardiac tamponade.
