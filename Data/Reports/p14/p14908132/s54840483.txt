                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with stage IV lung cancer status post pericardial window
 ___ ___.  To assess for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 Compared to the prior study, the cardiac silhouette is not significantly
 changed given that the prior study was an AP radiograph and today's is a PA
 radiograph.  This would suggest that the silhouette has actually increased in
 size.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions noted slightly smaller on the right
 side, probably unchanged on the left side.  There are prominent vascular
 markings at the hila bilaterally and some unchanged opacification at the right
 mid zone.  The visualized osseous structures show multilevel degenerative
 changes in the spine.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Little change in cardiac silhouette when compared to prior study.
