                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for sternal wound dehisence
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Intact mediastinal wires are seen. There gas projecting over the sternum
 vertically in the expected location of the operative site. This has increased
 since the previous study. If there is high concern for sternal dehiscence,
 would recommend dedicated chest CT.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  There are low lung volumes with atelectasis at the lung bases.
 There are no pneumothoraces.
