                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary fibrosis, recently treatment at
 outside facility for a pneumonia.  Please assess for any interval change
 compared to ___ chest x-ray.  // ? interval change    ? interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneously distributed linear opacities, more pronounced in the left lung
 than the right have progressed only minimally since ___.  How much of this
 represents progression of underlying Lung Disease and how much might be the
 residual of recent pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate.  In addition
 some of the abnormality in the Lung that I ascribe to interstitial lung
 disease could be bronchiectasis.
 Heart is normal size and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement.
 A 9 mm wide round opacity projecting over the intersection of the left first
 rib anteriorly and the medial H of the left scapula could be an insignificant
 region of bone sclerosis or a lung nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recent prior chest imaging, particularly chest CT should
 be obtained, to determine the extent to which residual pneumonia may be
 present, and to assess the possibility of at least one small left lung nodule.
