                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly reduced but are improved compared to
 ___ radiograph.  Coarse reticular opacities are present with a
 peripheral and basilar predominance in keeping with known history of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  On the lateral view, a subtle area of opacity has
 developed overlying the lower thoracic spine.  It is uncertain whether this
 represents a confluent area of fibrosis or an early focus of pneumonia. 
 Otherwise, there are no new areas of opacity compared to the prior chest
 radiograph.  No pleural effusions are evident.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits and without change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Chronic peripheral and basilar interstitial lung disease, which may be due
 to fibrotic NSIP or UIP.  
 
 2.  Subtle opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 radiograph, possibly due to a coalescing area of basilar fibrosis.  However,
 if the patient is experiencing infectious symptoms, an early focus of
 pneumonia should be considered, and follow up radiographs may be helpful in
 this regard.
