                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient with chronic
 lymphocytic interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  CT
 torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral linear and patchy opacities have increased in the right
 upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe since ___.  These
 findings could represent progression of the previously seen pleuroparenchymal
 scarring characterized on the CT torso from ___ or could be due
 to superimposed infection.  Normal heart, mediastinal, and pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacities in the right upper, left lower, and right
 lower lobes could represent progression of known interstitial lung disease or
 superimposed infectious process.  Correlation with clinical symptoms is
 recommended.  If clinical symptoms of an infection are present, repeat chest
 radiograph after four weeks of antibiotic treatment is recommended to document
 resolution of the opacities; however, if the patient has no symptoms, CT is
 recommended for further characterization of a possible neoplastic process in
 the right lower lobe.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 at 4:27, 10 minutes after the time of discovery.
