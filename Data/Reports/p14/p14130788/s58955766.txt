                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right
 base opacity raises concern for underlying infection.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Overall the lung markings appear somewhat coarsened
 which could be due to chronic lung disease.  There also appears to be central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
