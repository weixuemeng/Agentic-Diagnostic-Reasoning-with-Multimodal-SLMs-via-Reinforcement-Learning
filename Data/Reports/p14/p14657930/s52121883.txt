 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  The chest drains have
 also been removed.  The Swan-Ganz catheter and the left chest tube persist. 
 There is minimal atelectasis and a potential minimal pleural effusion at the
 right lung bases.  Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.
