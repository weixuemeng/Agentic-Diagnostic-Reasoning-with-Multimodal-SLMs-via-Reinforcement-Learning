                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FROM ___ at 6:05
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypertension, end-stage renal disease
 with wheezing, shortness of breath.  Evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:46 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 6:05 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC,
 unchanged.  There is some overlying motion.  However, there are worsening
 bibasilar and interstitial opacities, consistent with worsening pulmonary
 edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 given marked patient rotation on the current examination.  No large
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are likely small layering bilateral effusions.
