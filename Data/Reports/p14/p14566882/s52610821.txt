                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, right sided PNA ___  // f/u PNA     
 f/u PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been almost complete
 clearing of the pulmonary vascular congestion.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Mild coarseness of interstitial markings with
 hyperexpansion of the lungs could reflect some chronic pulmonary disease.  No
 definite acute focal pneumonia, though there is increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region which, in the appropriate clinical setting, could certain
 the represent a developing consolidation.
