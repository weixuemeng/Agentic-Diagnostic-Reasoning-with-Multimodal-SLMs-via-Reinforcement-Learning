 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs evocative of
 pulmonary edema have almost completely disappeared.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette has also decreased.  There are areas of mild atelectasis at the
 right and left lung bases, but no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax or other
 pathological change.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
