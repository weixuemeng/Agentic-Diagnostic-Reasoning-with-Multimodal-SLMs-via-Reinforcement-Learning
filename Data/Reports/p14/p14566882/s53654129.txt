 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Heart remains enlarged.  There is calcification in the aorta consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  There is interstitial prominence which may reflect
 age-related changes or small airways disease.  Overall, there is somewhat
 improved aeration at the right lung base where there are residual streaky
 opacities which may represent scarring or residual atelectasis.  The
 previously described faint nodular opacity at the right base is not apparent
 on the current study.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
