                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and history of
 congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Peribronchial cuffing and
 fissural density suggests fluid overload.  Pulmonary vascular cephalization is
 again noted.  Mild cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity are also again noted. 
 No definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  The lungs are
 again noted to be hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable cardiomegaly and vascular cephalization with new peribronchial
 cuffing and fissural density, which are likely secondary to fluid overload;
 peribronchial cuffing can also be seen with bronchiolitis.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ by Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 3:10 p.m. on ___.
