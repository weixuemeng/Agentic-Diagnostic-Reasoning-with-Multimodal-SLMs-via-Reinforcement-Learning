                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged with marked mitral annular
 calcification.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.
 Mild pulmonary edema is new in the interval.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  More focal opacity in the right lung base may reflect
 an area of atelectasis.  Previously demonstrated right fat containing
 diaphragmatic hernia is not well assessed on the current radiograph.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.  The osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized with moderate multilevel degenerative changes seen throughout
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New mild pulmonary edema.  More focal right basilar opacity may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
