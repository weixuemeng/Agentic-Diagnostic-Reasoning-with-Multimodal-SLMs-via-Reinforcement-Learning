                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___, through
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 unchanged since at least ___.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion
 with associated interstitial edema is mild.  Increased opacity at the right
 lung base is more pronounced compared to prior examinations.  Pleural surfaces
 are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema. 
 Asymmetrically increased density at the right lung base is likely related
 edema, however, concurrent pneumonia is not excluded.  Consider repeat imaging
 after diuresis to assess for improvement.
