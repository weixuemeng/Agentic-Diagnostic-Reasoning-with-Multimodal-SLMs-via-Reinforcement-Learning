 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic hyperinflation, in the absence of emphysema, is due to long-standing
 small airway obstruction.
 
 Differences in radiographic technique may explain the change in contour of the
 diaphragmatic interface of the right lung, but it would be prudent to evaluate
 that with conventional radiographs to make sure there is no pneumonia.
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is also chronic.  Mitral annulus calcification
 is noted, occasionally this is hemodynamically significant, but there is no
 evidence of cardiac decompensation.
