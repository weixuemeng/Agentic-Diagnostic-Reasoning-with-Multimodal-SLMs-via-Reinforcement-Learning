                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior chest radiograph from earlier today as well as a PET
 CT dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, patient on Coumadin, history of gastric cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Port-A-Cath
 resides over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the expected
 level of the superior vena cava.  The lungs are clear bilaterally without
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  The imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  Cortical irregularity at the right distal clavicle likely indicates
 an old injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Port-A-Cath resides in appropriate position.  No acute
 intrathoracic process.
