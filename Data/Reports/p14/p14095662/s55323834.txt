                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer, here with lethargy. Evaluate
 for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with the known left upper lobe mass less well
 appreciated on the current radiograph than on the prior CT from ___. 
 Since the prior study, there is new opacification of the left lower lung,
 which could represent a combination of atelectasis, parenchymal consolidation,
 and pleural fluid.  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New left lower lobe opacification, likely representing combination of
 pleural fluid, atelectasis, and pulmonary consolidation. Findings support the
 diagnosis of pneumonia.
 2. Known left upper lobe mass is less well appreciated on the current
 radiograph than on prior cross-sectional imaging.
