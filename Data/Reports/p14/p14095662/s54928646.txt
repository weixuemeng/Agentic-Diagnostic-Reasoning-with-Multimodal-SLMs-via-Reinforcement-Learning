                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dry cough and malaise.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There is mild unfolding and calcification along the thoracic
 aorta.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Fissures are
 thickened and the interstitium is moderately prominent.  Projecting over the
 medial left upper lobe is a focal opacity which has vague borders and measures
 about 3 cm.  This is compatible but not diagnostic of a focal consolidation. 
 A pulmonary mass with associated atelectasis would be an additional
 consideration.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Focal opacity in the left upper lobe, which could be seen with
 consolidative pneumonia, but a mass is not excluded.  If clinical
 circumstances suggest pneumonia, then short-term followup radiographs could be
 considered within four weeks for close surveillance.  Otherwise, chest CT
 could be considered, although the latter cannot always distinguish malignancy
 from infection.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Atypical infection or severe airway inflammation are other possibilities, but
 probably less likely.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
