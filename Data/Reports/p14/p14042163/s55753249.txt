                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w lymphoma s/p R thoracentesis, cervical med  // eval pulm
 effusion s/p thoracentesis (RIGHT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
 
 There is a moderate to large right-sided hydro-pneumothorax seen predominantly
 at the right base status post recent thoracentesis.  The amount of right
 pleural fluid is markedly decreased.  A small to moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion is minimally increased.  Adjacent pulmonary opacity likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis.  Opacity at the base of the right lung likely
 reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right hydro pneumothorax seen at the base of the right lung is
 demonstrated however the amount of right pleural fluid is markedly decreased,
 reflecting invertal thoracentesis.  Moderate left effusion is minimally
 increased.  Pulmonary opacities at the bases likely reflects atelectasis or
 mild edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Findings discussed with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 16:11 on ___.
