                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  A dual-chamber pacemaker located in the left hemithorax has
 leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A new retrocardiac
 opacity could represent pneumonia given the clinical history.  The heart size
 is normal and there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New retrocardiac opacity could represent pneumonia considering
 the clinical history.
