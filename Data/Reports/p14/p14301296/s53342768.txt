                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hip fx.  // preop
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications. ___ x 9 mm calcification
 projecting over the medial aspect of the left apex is noted. Patchy opacities
 within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 ___ x 9 mm calcification projecting over the medial aspect of the left apex is
 likely benign, and correlation with previous imaging is recommended.
