                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal reconstruction.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Again seen is a drain overlying the upper trachea, possibly with minimal
 associated soft tissue density at the right lung apex medially.  Otherwise,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette shows mild cardiomegaly, slightly improved. 
 There is upper zone re-distribution, without overt CHF.  There is some
 atelectasis in the retrocardiac region.  However, no other focal opacities are
 identified.  No effusion.  No overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, without
 other evidence for acute pulmonary process.
