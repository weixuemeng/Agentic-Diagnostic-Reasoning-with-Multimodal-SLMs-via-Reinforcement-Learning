                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complex idiopathic subglottic proximal tracheal stenosis status post
 tracheal resection, reconstruction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 The head/chin overlies the upper chest and medial portion of both lung apices.
 Allowing for this, an oblique radiopacity in the area of interest may
 represent a drain.  Obscuration of the lung apices limits assessment for tiny
 pneumothorax, but no obvious pneumothorax is identified. The mediastinum
 remains midline and the visualized portion of the mediastinum is within normal
 limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.  Minimal atelectasis left
 base.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Drain. No obvius ptx or acute pulmonary process. Please see comment above.
