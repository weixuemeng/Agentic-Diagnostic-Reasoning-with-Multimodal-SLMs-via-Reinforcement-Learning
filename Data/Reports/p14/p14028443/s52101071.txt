  As before severe bullous disease limits visualization of pneumothorax in the
  right hemi thorax. Overall there is no appreciable change from the study
  earlier today. Small persistent apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
  Orientation of the pigtail catheter is slightly change but likely still in
  satisfactory position.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman likely bleeding into her chest after misplaced
 central line  // ? accumulation of hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:   Study performed 10 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are midline . Right lower lobe opacity has
 improved. Mild vascular congestion on the left has improved. Right pigtail
 catheter is in unchanged position. Evaluation of the right pneumothorax is
 limited by the presence of large subcutaneous gas collection and known severe
 bolus formation in the lungs.
