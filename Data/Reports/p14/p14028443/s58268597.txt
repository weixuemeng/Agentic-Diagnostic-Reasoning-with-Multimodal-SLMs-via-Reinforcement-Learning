                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with right pneumothorax.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval increase in the left
 mediastinal shift as well as interval change in the appearance of the right
 hilus and increase in the lucency of the right lung, finding that might
 potentially be representing worsening of the pneumothorax and potential fluid
 loculation versus mediastinal/hilar hemorrhage.  Attention on this area on the
 subsequent study is required.  
 
 The right basal opacity corresponds to the atelectasis of the right lower lobe
 demonstrated on the CT.
