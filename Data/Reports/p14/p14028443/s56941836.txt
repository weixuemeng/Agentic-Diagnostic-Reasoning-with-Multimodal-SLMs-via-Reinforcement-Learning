 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest pigtail catheter with
 significant interval decrease in  large right pneumothorax, which is now
 moderate to large but substantially decreased in size as compared to the prior
 study. No evidence of tension is seen. A new large amount of subcutaneous
 emphysema is seen overlying the right axilla and right chest wall, possibly
 extending in to the right upper arm, new since the prior study. There
 continues to be atelectasis of the right lung. The right internal jugular
 central venous catheter is grossly stable in position, given differences in
 patient position. The appearance of the left lung is stable.

 Extensive new right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.  Interval placement of right
 chest pigtail catheter with significant interval decrease in right
 pneumothorax, but with moderate to large right pneumothorax persisting. No
