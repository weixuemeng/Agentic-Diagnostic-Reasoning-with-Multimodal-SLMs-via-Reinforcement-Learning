                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Extensive bullous emphysematous disease is re- demonstrated, more
 pronounced on the right.  There may be a tiny residual right pleural effusion.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be completely excluded. No definite pneumothorax is identified. There
 are no acute osseous changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive bullous emphysema. Probable bibasilar atelectasis and residual
 minimal trace right pleural effusion. Infection at the lung bases cannot be
 completely excluded.
