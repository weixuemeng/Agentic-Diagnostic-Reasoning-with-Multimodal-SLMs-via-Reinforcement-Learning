                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There
 is minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal streaky opacity within the left lung base may
 reflect an area of atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base.  This could reflect an area of
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
