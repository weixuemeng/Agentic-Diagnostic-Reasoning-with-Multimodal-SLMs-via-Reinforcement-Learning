                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A confluent opacity adjacent to the left heart border has
 progressed since the recent study, and is concerning for an evolving pneumonia
 in the setting of fever and cough.  On the lateral view, this appears to
 involve both the inferior lingular segment and adjacent anteromedial basilar
 segment of the left lower lobe.  There is also a suggestion of a small focus
 of consolidation at the right lung base.  The heart size is normal.  Upper
 zone vascular redistribution is accompanied by perihilar haziness and
 scattered septal lines.  Small pleural effusions are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening consolidation involving portions of the lingula and left lower
 lobe, concerning for evolving infectious pneumonia.  Possible additional site
 in right lung base.
 2.  Interstitial edema and small pleural effusions.
