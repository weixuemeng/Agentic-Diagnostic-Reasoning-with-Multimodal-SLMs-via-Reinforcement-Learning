                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right middle lobe opacity with volume loss causing shift of the minor fissure
 is more pronounced on today's exam and best appreciated on the lateral view.
 The lungs are otherwise clear except for unchanged appearance of asymmetrical
 biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring, right greater than left.  No
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists and is without change.  The tortuous descending thoracic aorta is
 also overall unchanged.  The pulmonary arteries are prominent but not
 enlarged.  Moderate degenerative changes of thoracic spine with anterior
 osteophytes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increased prominence of right middle lobe opacity, suggesting
 possible chronic middle lobe syndrome with or potentially chronic MAC
 infection - follow-up with short-term radiographs or chest CT could be
 performed if warranted clinically.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:21 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
