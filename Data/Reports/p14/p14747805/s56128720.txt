                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with carotid body tumor,
 intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was obtained and reviewed.
 
 The ET tube tip is 2.7 cm above the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for potential minimal
 bibasilar areas of atelectasis potentially related to suboptimal inspiration
 at this point.
 
 Excretion of the IV contrast in the collecting system is noted and most likely
 related to recent CT obtained with IV contrast.
