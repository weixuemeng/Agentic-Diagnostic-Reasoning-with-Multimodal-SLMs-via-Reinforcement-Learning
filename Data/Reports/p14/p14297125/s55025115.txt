 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:29 PM
  ET tube approximately 1.0 cm above the carina and should be pulled back by
  several cm for more appropriate positioning. A catheter overlying is the left
  upper abdomen may be related to recent pericardial drainage. Right internal
  jugular line terminates in the upper to mid SVC. The cardiac silhouette
  remains enlarged after pericardial effusion drainage. Mild to moderate
  pulmonary edema. More confluent opacity at the right apex may indicate
  aspiration or infection, and attention on followup is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
   Comparison with old.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p emergent drainge pericardial effusion for
 tamponade  // eval for ETT position      eval for ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New endotracheal tube ends at the carina and should be withdrawn at least 3 cm
 for optimal position.  Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  Upper
 enteric drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view. 
 Mild pulmonary edema has increased.  Left lower lobe consolidation presumably
 atelectasis is stable.  Moderate enlargement of the postoperative
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Left pleural
 effusion small if any.
