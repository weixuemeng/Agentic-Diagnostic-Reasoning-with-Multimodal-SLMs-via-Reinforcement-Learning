 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower, which may account for an apparent increase in moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Left lower lobe is still largely atelectatic. The smaller
 region of consolidation at the right lung base medially is partially obscured,
 probably not significantly changed.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Right
 and left jugular lines end in the low and mid SVC respectively.
