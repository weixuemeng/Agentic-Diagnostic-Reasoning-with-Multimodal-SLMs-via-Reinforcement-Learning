                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual lead pacemaker/ ICD device again with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable. Interstitial prominence suggests mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the left lower lobe are nonspecific and
 not necessarily changed more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest interstitial pulmonary edema. Streaky opacification at the
 left lung base, probably unchanged and due to minor chronic atelectasis.
