 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:23 PM
  
  1. Low lung volumes and a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  Opacity at the right
  cardiophrenic angle likely reflects crowding of bronchovascular structures. 
  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without evidence of focal pneumonia.
  2. Tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta.
  3. No pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
  4. Reportedly known posterior right eleventh and twelfth rib fractures are not
  clearly seen.
  C.  Hostage ___ at 17:21.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall from standing, unwitnessed with scalp lacerations ?
 left eye gaze deviation with hypotension and unresponsiveness at OSH; R post
 ___ rib fx, C7,T2 TP fx  // Concern for PNA    Concern for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower, but this does not account for focus of greater
 opacification at the right lung base, either atelectasis or aspiration.  Right
 upper lung and left lung are clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
