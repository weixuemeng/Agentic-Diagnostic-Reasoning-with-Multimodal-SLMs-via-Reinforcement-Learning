                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes that may account for the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of
 the heart.  There is increasing opacification at both bases with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragms, most likely related to pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis.  No definite vascular congestion.  Nasogastric tube
 again extends to the upper stomach.  Side hole is very close to the
 esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward several cm.
