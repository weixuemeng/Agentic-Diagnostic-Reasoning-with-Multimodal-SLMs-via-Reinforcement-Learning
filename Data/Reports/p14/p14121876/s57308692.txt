                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 Compared with ___ at 6:33 a.m. and allowing for differences in positioning
 and technique, there may be slight interval improvement in the CHF findings.  
 
 Again seen is a large left effusion, with sparing of residual aerated lung in
 the left upper zone.  The degree of aeration in this portion of the lung does
 appear improved compared with ___.  The right lung is grossly clear,
 though there is suggestion of small nodular densities.  No right-sided
 infiltrate or effusion is detected. On the current study, mediastinum is
 closer to midline allowing for rotation. 
 
 Clinical correlation regarding the large left-sided effusion is requested.  Is
 there reason to suspect a malignant effusion?  This finding was discussed with
 Dr. ___ on the afternoon of the exam (___, phone).
