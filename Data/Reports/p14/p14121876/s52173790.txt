                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assessment of interval changes of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 most recent prior study, the left pleural effusion has markedly decreased and
 there is improved expansion in the left lung with residual opacity likely
 representing re-expansion edema and basilar atelectasis.  A chest tube enters
 the left lower hemithorax and there is a small left apical pneumothorax.  A
 small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectas are unchanged.  No
 right pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small left apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Marked decrease in small left pleural effusion.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 at 11:29 a.m. at the time of discovery.
