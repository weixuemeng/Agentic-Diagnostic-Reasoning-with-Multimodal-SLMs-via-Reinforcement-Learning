                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___ with SOB  // R/O acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT from ___ at 20:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is normal size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Lucent
 appearance of the upper lungs, right more than left, and hyperinflation is
 suggestive of underlying emphysema.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities
 with prominence of the hilar structures may represent mild pulmonary
 interstitial edema, however, an atypical infection may have a similar
 appearance.  Opacification of the left costophrenic angle may represent
 pleural thickening or a small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Underlying emphysema and chronic interstitial changes.
 
 2.  Bilateral interstitial opacities may be due to mild pulmonary interstitial
 edema or atypical pneumonia.  Follow-up chest radiograph after diuresis would
 be helpful.
