 The dictation of this study was lost in the system and is again redictated on
 ___, in the afternoon.
 
 This exam was compared to prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.  There has been interval worsening of moderate-to-severe pulmonary
 edema, asymmetric on the right, superimposed infection/pneumonia is likely
 present.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right central catheter
 tip is in the right atrium.  Left PICC tip is in the low SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are likely small and present, but given the
 position of the patient, they appear to be decreased.
