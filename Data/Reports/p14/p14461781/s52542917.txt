                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent CABG, HTN, HLD p/w SOB and productive cough  //
 any evidence of PNA? progression of bilateral pleural effusions? other abn?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are again noted.  Previously noted right IJ central venous
 catheter has been removed.  There is similar extent of left basal opacity
 consistent with at least moderate effusion and subjacent consolidation, likely
 atelectasis though difficult to exclude pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting.  There is a tiny right pleural effusion.  The heart size is difficult
 to assess.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Left basal
 consolidation likely atelectasis versus pneumonia.
