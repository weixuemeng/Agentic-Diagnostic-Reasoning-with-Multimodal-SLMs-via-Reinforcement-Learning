                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and right pleural effusion status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior evening.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube remains in the right hemithorax. This study shows reaccumulation
 of a pleural effusion on the right, probably small to moderate in size, with
 volume loss and opacity probably due to increasing atelectasis. Left basilar
 opacification appears similar to minimally improved. Perihilar congestion is
 new. Nondisplaced right third through fifth, and potentially sixth rib
 fractures, appear unchanged although the fourth rib fracture is better
 visualized on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Recurring right-sided pleural effusion with opacity probably due to
 atelectasis. Findings suggest new mild vascular congestion.
