                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MRSA pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion,
 s/p R chest tube placement  // effusion, pneumothorax?     effusion,
 pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable change in small right pleural effusion
 following removal of the right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter.
 However consolidation in the right lower lobe has worsened.  Some of this is
 probably atelectasis, but the change is concerning for worsening pneumonia or
 focal pulmonary hemorrhage. Mild edema in the left lower lobe has improved. 
 Borderline cardiomegaly is stable.  No left pneumothorax.  Biapical thickening
 of the pleural margins is stable.  Configurations suggests prior radiation to
 the upper chest or neck.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Close followup advised for increasing pneumonia or
 possible hemorrhage, right lower lobe.
