                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with encephalopathy and seizures  // PNA?     
 PNA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity
 of the aorta.  Increasing opacification of the left base with silhouetting
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with a combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 There also is increased opacification at the right base.  Although this could
 merely represent atelectasis, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would
 also have to be considered in this region as well.
