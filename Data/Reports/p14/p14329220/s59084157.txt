                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizure disorder, history of left frontal
 cerebral vascular accident, non ST elevation myocardial infarction, and atrial
 fibrillation who presents with unresponsiveness of unknown etiology.  The
 patient is being treated with levofloxacin for possible community-acquired
 pneumonia due to possible infiltrate on portable chest radiograph on
 admission.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, and a left retrocardiac opacity is improved from the
 recent radiograph and likely reflects atelectasis.  Minimal linear atelectasis
 is also demonstrated at the right lung base.  There are small pleural
 effusions.  No definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 heart is normal in size given low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions and improved aeration of the left
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  No new or progressive consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
