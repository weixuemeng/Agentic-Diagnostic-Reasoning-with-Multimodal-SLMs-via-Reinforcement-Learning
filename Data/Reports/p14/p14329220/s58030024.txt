                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizures and spastic paraparesis, has had
 intermittent hypoxia during hospital stay, now hypoxic again with diffusely
 rhonchorous lungs  // Evidence of new process to explain hypoxia -
 specifically infiltrate or pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ targeted review of chest CTA from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region medially, probably
 slightly worse compared with ___.  There is minimal atelectasis at the
 right base, also more pronounced.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF.  No gross effusion.
 
 Small left upper lobe nodule and left upper lobe opacities as well as small
 pericardial effusion and bronchial wall thickening seen on the CT scan
 performed 1 day earlier are not well depicted radiographically.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region medially and minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base, both slightly worse compared with ___.  While this could represent atelectasis, an early pneumonic infiltrative
 or changes related to aspiration could also account for the retrocardiac
 opacity.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, similar to the prior film.  No overt CHF.
