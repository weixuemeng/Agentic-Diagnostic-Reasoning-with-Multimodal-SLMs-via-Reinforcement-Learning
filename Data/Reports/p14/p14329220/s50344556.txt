                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p Dobhoff. Please evaluate placement.  //
 Dobhoff placement.      Dobhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 17:04 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The tube should be advanced at least 8-10 cm to
 ensure that is projecting within the stomach.  Subsequent imaging on a study
 at 18:03 demonstrates the tube to be in satisfactory position.  A left
 subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs appear well inflated with linear
 opacity at the left base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
