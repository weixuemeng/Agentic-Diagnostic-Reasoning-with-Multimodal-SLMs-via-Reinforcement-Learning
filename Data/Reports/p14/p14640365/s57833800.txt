                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Subtle,
 small, symmetric opacities overlying the lower lungs on the frontal projection
 may represent nipple shadows.  Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Bony structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  As detailed above, nipple shadows likely
 account for nodular opacities projecting over the lower lungs bilaterally. 
 This can be confirmed with repeat utilizing nipple markers.
