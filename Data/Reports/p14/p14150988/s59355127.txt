 eval for pulm edema or other hypoxia cause      eval for pulm edema or other
 hypoxia cause
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 indistinctness of ill defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  An area of more coalescent opacification is
 suggested at the right base with focal silhouetting hemidiaphragm.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this would raise the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia.
