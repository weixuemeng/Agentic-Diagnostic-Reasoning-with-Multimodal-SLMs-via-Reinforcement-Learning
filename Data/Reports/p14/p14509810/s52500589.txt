                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is mildly tortuous and
 demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is a result of the low lung volumes.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema, though mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be
 present.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis,
 similar compared to the prior exam.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and mild
 bibasilar atelectasis, similar compared to the prior exam.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.  If there is continued concern for rib fracture, a
 dedicated rib series is recommended.
