                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased work of breathing  // ?mucus plug
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 tracheostomy tube. The previously malpositioned left central venous access
 line has been removed.  There is a newly appeared retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 That could be causing the clinical presentation and might be the consequence
 of mucous plugging of the airway tree.  Presence of a small left pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. No
 pneumonia.
