 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with TBI  // eval for ETT position
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___:04.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube, right subclavian line, and nasogastric tube in standard placements
 respectively.
 
 Pulmonary edema has improved, moderate in most locations, but there is still a
 more significant consolidation in the right lower lobe which needs to be
 followed to distinguish dependent edema and atelectasis from concurrent
 pneumonia. Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly larger. The heart is
 normal size. Hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
