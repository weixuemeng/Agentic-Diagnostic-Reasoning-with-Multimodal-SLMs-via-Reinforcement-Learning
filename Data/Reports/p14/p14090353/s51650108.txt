 ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at
 the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and blunting of the
 costophrenic angle.  The configuration is consistent with substantial volume
 loss in the left lower lobe and associated pleural effusion.  There appears to
 be shift of the mediastinum to the left, though some of this could be related
 to obliquity of the patient port this side.
 The right lung is clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion. 
 Gastrostomy tube is in place and there is evidence of an old healed fracture
 of the midportion of the right clavicle.  The right PICC line is been removed.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___, the nurse taking care of the patient in the SICU who
 will contact the resident.
