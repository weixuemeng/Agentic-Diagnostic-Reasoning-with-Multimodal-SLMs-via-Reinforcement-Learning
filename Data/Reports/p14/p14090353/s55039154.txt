                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tracheostomy back on vent  // pna?      pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged. There again is increased opacification at the left base with
 poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. Although this could merely reflect
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would
 have to be seriously considered.  Much less prominent atelectatic changes are
 seen on the right.
