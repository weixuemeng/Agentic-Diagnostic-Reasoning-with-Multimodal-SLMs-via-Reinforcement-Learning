                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe brain injury now desaturating on high
 vent settings  // pulmonary edema, worsening infiltrate?
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Background pulmonary edema is improving, but severe consolidation persists in
 the lower lobes right greater than left. Whether this is residual edema or
 concurrent pneumonia due to aspiration is difficult to say.  Moderate right
 and small left pleural effusions are stable. Heart is normal size.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is mild.
 
 ET tube in standard position.  Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.
 Nasogastric tube is coiled in a nondistended stomach.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not
 sufficient for detection or characterization of chest cage lesions. Any focal
 findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or
 CT scanning.
