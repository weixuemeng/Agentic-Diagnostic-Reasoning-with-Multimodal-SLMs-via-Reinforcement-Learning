 The retrocardiac opacification is improved compared to prior.  This is likely
 an atelectasis, however in appropriate clinical setting pneumonia is difficult
 to exclude.  Tracheostomy tube is in similar position as prior. A PEG tube is
 noted in the stomach which is distended with air. The radiodense line looped
 near the neck is likely external to the patient.
