                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cancer lung mets generalized weakness, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Opacity in the right upper
 lobe has substantially decreased, leaving residual nodularity which may
 reflect residual malignancy at the site, but opacification is markedly
 decreased.  Elsewhere the lungs remain clear.  There are no pleural effusions.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent nodularity in the right upper lobe, but overall marked decrease in
 opacification.  Findings suggest improvement in malignancy and associated
 atelectasis; acute process is doubtful.
