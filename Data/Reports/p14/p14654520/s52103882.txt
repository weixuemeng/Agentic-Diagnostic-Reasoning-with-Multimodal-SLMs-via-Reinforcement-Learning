                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic NSCLC from RUL, s/p transbronch
 bx on right  // PTX?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.  Targeted review of chest CT from
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large area of somewhat patchy opacity in the right upper zone, with
 evidence of slight volume loss in the right upper lobe.  The appearance is in
 keeping with findings on the ___ CT scan, though direct assessment
 for any subtle interval change is limited by differences in the ___ modalities.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline and is grossly unchanged. 
 Mild unfolding of the aorta is again noted.
 
 There is somewhat patchy atelectasis at the left lung base, which is new
 compared with  ___ and probably also ___.  No frank
 consolidation is identified.  No evidence of CHF.  No gross effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy partially confluent opacity right upper zone with mild right upper lobe
 volume loss.  Please see comment above.  Assessment of this finding is best
 correlated with the full clinical scenario.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Patchy subsegmental atelectasis left base.  Attention to this area on followup
 films is recommended to exclude evidence of aspiration or developing
 pneumonia.
