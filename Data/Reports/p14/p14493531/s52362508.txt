 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with with lightheadness  // role out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting vascular
 engorgement. The right hilum appears more prominent than the left which may
 relate to prominent vessels, however underlying lymphadenopathy is not
 excluded. No focal consolidation is seen. There is minor left basilar
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.

 due to vascular engorgement but underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded.
 Findings could be further assessed on a nonurgent chest CT.
