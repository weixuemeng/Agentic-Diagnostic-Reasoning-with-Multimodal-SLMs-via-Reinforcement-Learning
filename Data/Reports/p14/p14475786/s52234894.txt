  Bibasilar opacities likely representing at least in part atelectasis noting
  that focal infection, particularly at the left lung base cannot be excluded
  and clinical correlation will be necessary.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:14 PM
  
  1. Bibasilar opacities likely representing pulmonary vascular congestion with
  a superimposed mild pulmonary edema.
  2. Left basilar retrocardiac opacity may represent additional component of
  atelectasis or superimposed consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes noted with crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is streaky right basilar
 opacity with more focal consolidation at the left lung base in the
 retrocardiac region.  There is no pneumothorax nor pleural effusion, although
 the extreme costophrenic angles are excluded from the field of view. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely representing at least in part atelectasis noting
 that focal infection, particularly at the left lung base cannot be excluded
 and clinical correlation will be necessary.
