                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sudden onset of severe back pain 5 days ago  /
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again noted with left
 ventricular predominance.  The aorta is tortuous but unchanged mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lung
 volumes are low with streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases compatible
 with atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized with compression
 deformity of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction appearing
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Diffuse osteopenia with compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction
 appearing unchanged.  Please note that the assessment for compression
 fractures is limited given the presence of osteopenia and if there is high
 concern for a vertebral body fracture, CT is recommended.
