 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation.  Relatively well inflated lungs.  Subtle patchy
 opacity in the right mid to lower lung could reflect an area of atelectasis,
 although an early infectious process should also be considered.  Followup
 imaging would be advised.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  No acute bony abnormality.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
