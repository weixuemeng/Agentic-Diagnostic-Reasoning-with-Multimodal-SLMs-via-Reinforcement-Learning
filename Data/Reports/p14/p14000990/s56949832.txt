                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A series of three portable AP sequential images of the chest, the first at
 ___, the second at ___ and the third at ___, are submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval attempted placement of a nasogastric tube which
 courses into the stomach but the tip ends up in the mid esophagus on all three
 images.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs are
 relatively well inflated.  The subtle opacity in the right mid lung on the
 previous study does not persist and therefore is felt to correspond to an area
 of patchy atelectasis.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
