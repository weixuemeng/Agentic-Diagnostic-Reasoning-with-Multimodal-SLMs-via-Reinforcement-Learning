                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rhabdomyolysis s/p fall. He received 7L of
 IVF resuscitation, now with increasing oxygen requirement and crackles on
 exam.  // Concern for fluid overload vs. possible infectious etiology. Please
 evaluate. Thanks.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by
 worsening asymmetrically distributed, alveolar and interstitial opacities
 which probably represent a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are apparently new.  There is no
 visible pneumothorax.
