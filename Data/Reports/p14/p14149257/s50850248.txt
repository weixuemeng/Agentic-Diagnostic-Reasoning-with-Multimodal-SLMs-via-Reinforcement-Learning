                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, question effusion or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  In this patient
 with history of lung cancer, a Port-A-Cath is again seen residing over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip in the region of the mid SVC.  The lungs
 appear clear, though volumes are low.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. 
 There was mild blunting of the CP angles posteriorly which likely reflects the
 presence of small bilateral pleural effusions.  The heart size cannot be
 assessed and the mediastinal contour appears stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable tiny pleural effusions.  Port-A-Cath in appropriate and
 unchanged position.  No definite signs of pneumonia.
