                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph again demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  This may also mask a pneumonia. 
 Allowing for this limitation, there is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to
 delineate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but no evidence of pneumonia.  PA and lateral
 views would be helpful, if obtainable.
