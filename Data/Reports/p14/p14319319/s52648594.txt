                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with abdominal pain and tachycardia.  Rule out free
 air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single erect portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung
 volumes, which accentuate the vasculature. Given the low lung volumes, it's
 difficult to discern the heart size, but it is likely normal.  No pleural
 effusion, edema, pneumothorax or evidence of pneumonia.  There is no evidence
 of free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Given low lung volumes, no acute cardiopulmonary process or
 evidence of free air.
