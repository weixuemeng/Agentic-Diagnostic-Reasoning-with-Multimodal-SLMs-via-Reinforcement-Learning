                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  There again is some increase in opacification in the perihilar
 and infrahilar region on the left.  This again could reflect an area of
 consolidation.
 
 The area of subtle opacity in the right lower lung is again seen, which also
 could reflect an infectious focus.
