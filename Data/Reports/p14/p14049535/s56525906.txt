 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:29 PM
  There is no focal airspace opacity to suggest aspiration pneumonia.
  Enlargement of the right hilum may be related to esophageal cancer or
  lymphadenopathy. There is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous
  air in the chest, likely from the recent jejunostomy placement. There is no
  pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The catheter of a right
  chest wall infusion port terminates in the low SVC. There is an esophageal
  stent in the lower chest and surgical clips in the left upper quadrant of the
  abdomen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no
 evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Right hilar
 enlargement, most likely is related to esophageal cancer or lymphadenopathy in
 a patient with a lower chest esophageal shunt.  Gas along the lateral chest
 walls and small amount of pneumoperitoneum likely reflect the recent
 jejunostomy placement.  The right IJ catheter tip lies in the mid-to-lower
 SVC.
