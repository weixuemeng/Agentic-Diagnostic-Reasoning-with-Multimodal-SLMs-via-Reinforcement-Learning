                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with PCV and secondary myelofibrosis,
 now with new cough, question pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 10:57 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of right internal jugular central line with its tip in
 the distal SVC.  The left subclavian catheter remains in place, unchanged. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient positioning between studies.  The lungs appear well inflated
 without evidence of pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  There continue to be some streaky opacities at both lung bases,
 but these appear to be chronic.  They were present in ___ and therefore
 likely reflect post-inflammatory scarring.  No pneumothorax.  No effusions. 
 If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
