                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AML, acute on chronic multifactorial respiratory
 dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia with recent reintubation, here to
 evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, the patient has been
 intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube terminating at the level of
 the thoracic inlet, approximately 43 mm above the carina.  An abandoned left
 subclavian catheter fragment is unchanged over multiple prior studies.  A left
 supraclavicular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and the SVC. 
 Suture chain material is again noted in the right lung base.  The inspiratory
 lung volumes remain low with associated mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal in size but stable with minimal
 calcification at the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate position of ET tube at the level of the thoracic inlet. 
 Otherwise, unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
