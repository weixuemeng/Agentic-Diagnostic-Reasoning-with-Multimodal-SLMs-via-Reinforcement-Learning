                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:55 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Breast carcinoma, polycythemia ___ and myelofibrosis after stem
 cell transplant.  New wheezes.  Possible pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no
 edema or pleural effusion.  Lung volumes are always large, not appreciably
 changed. Subject to technical limitations of bedside radiographs in this
 patient, it is possible that there is a new nodular lesion in the left mid
 lung laterally.  I would strongly recommend conventional chest radiographs for
 confirmation.
 
 Left subclavian line and a right supraclavicular dual-channel central venous
 line both end in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
