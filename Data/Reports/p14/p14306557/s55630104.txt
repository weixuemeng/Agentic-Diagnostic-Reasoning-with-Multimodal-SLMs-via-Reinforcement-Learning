                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two day history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Several chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  Left internal jugular Port-A-Cath ends in the upper superior
 vena cava.  A right internal jugular line ends in the lower SVC.  A left
 subclavian line remnant ends in the lower superior vena cava.  Right lower
 lobe lung scarring is unchanged and consistent with the patient's history of
 right lower lobe wedge resection. Linear left lower lobe opacities likely
 represent scarring or atelectasis.  Slight mediastinal widening is due to
 mediastinal lipomatosis that is better characterized on chest CT from ___.  Normal heart and pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
