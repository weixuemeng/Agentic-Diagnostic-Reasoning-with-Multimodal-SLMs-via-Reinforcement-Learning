                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malpositioned central line, status post flush.  Question has central
 line flipped into the superior vena cava.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Three portable chest radiographs were provided demonstrating the leftsided
 central line placement in different configurations, presumably pre and post
 power flush.  Initial radiograph demonstrates positioning of central line in
 the azygos vein.  Final image demonstrates left-sided central venous catheter
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  In addition there is a large
 fragmented leftsided venous catheter extending from the subclavian veins to
 the cavoatrial junction related to prior unsuccessful retrieval, unchanged in
 position compared to ___.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 evident.  Stable linear opacifications are noted within bilateral lung bases
 likely representing combination of postsurgical scarring and atelectasis.  No
 new pulmonary opacifications evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Successful repositioning of a left-sided central venous catheter with tip at
 cavoatrial junction.  No migration of remnant left central venous catheter
 fragment spanning the subclavian vein to cavoatrial junction.
