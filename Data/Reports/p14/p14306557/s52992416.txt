                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling lines are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities have
 slightly worsened, and favor atelectasis, but co-existing infectious pneumonia
 is possible in the setting of a neutropenic fever.  Remainder of lungs are
 clear with no new areas of consolidation.
