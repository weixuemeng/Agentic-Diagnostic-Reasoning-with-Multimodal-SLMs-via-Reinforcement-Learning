                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP CHEST, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and wheezing. 
 Evaluate for edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC.  There
 is also a left-sided central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the
 distal SVC.  Heart size is within normal limits.  There is evidence of prior
 surgery at the right base with parenchymal sutures.  There is some increased
 density at both lung bases, which may be due to a combination of scarring,
 atelectasis, and/or developing infiltrate, particularly on the right base. 
 Continued attention to this area is recommended on subsequent films.  There is
 no overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
