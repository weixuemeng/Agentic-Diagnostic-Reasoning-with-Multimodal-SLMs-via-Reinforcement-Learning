                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 309  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with AFib and worsening respiratory
 distress. Evaluate for worsening edema, effusions.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:09 a.m. is submitted and compared
 to ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian line and right internal jugular central line are unchanged
 in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given differences in positioning.  There is likely an increasing right pleural
 effusion.  Overall, the focal airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe
 is not significantly changed.  Other patchy opacities in the right upper lobe
 and in the left lower lobe are also stable.  Findings would be more consistent
 with an infectious process such as multifocal pneumonia.  There continues to
 be mild vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema is evident.  No
 pneumothorax.
