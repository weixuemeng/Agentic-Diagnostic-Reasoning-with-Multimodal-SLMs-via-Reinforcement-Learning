                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of polycythemia ___ and secondary myelofibrosis status post
 MUD allo-HCT on ___, GVHD, evaluate for acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD. 
 
 There is streaky opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and there appear to
 be sutures.  This may represent scarring.  Allowing for technical differences,
 this is probably similar to ___.  
 
 Otherwise, no focal opacity.  No gross effusion.  The heart is not enlarged. 
 There is no CHF.  
 
 Again seen are two lines, apparently right IJ and left subclavian lines, both
 tips are over distal SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant change
 compared with ___.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  Scarring
 at right base again noted.
