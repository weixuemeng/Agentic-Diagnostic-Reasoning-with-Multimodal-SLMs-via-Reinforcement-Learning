 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___,
 and CT chest examination is dated ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous
 line, as well as interval placement of a right tunneled central line which
 terminates in the mid SVC.  A retained fragment of a left central venous line
 is in unchanged position, terminating in the lower SVC.  There is no
 associated pneumothorax.  A stable right lower lobe linear opacity is stable
 and better characterized on prior CT examination.  There are no additional
 acute findings of consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  The
 heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right tunneled central venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  No radiologic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process or chronic
 granulomatous disease.
