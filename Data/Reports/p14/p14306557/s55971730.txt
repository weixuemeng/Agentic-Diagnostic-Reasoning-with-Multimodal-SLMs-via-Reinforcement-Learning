                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with resolving multifocal pneumonia, aortic
 regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and new hypoxia and hypercapnia.  Evaluate
 for worsening of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___ and CT of the chest dated ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 improvement in right lower lobe opacification. Persistent right pleural
 effusion is moderate in size. Left pleural effusion has decreased in size over
 the interval, and now is small. Bilateral peribronchovascular infiltration has
 improved, but is persistent. Nodular opacities are less confluent as compared
 to the prior radiograph.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 The fragment of the left-sided subclavian central venous line is in unchanged
 position.  The right-sided central venous line is in unchanged position, with
 the tip ending at the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Slight interval improvement in bilateral multifocal pulmonary opacities
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  
 
 2.  Persistent moderate sized right pleural effusion with interval decrease in
 left pleural effusion, which is now small.
