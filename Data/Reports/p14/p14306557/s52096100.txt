 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with VRE bacteremia, endocarditis, now

 similar study of ___.  On the present single frontal view chest
 examination, the previously described right internal jugular approach and
 left-sided subclavian approach central venous lines are identified and in
 unchanged position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size remains normal,
 and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Crowded appearance
 of pulmonary structures in right lower area, some increased interstitial
 markings are noted, but no suspicious parenchymal infiltrate remains.  Similar
 changes also noted on the left lung base with a peripheral plate atelectasis
 completely unchanged in appearance.  The diaphragmatic contours are free and
 the lateral pleural sinuses do not show any fluid accumulation.

 examinations.  No evidence of new acute infiltrates in this single AP chest
 view examination.
