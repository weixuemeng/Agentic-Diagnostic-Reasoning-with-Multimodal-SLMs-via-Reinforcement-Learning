                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, liver failure, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are clear
 bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Small
 nodular opacities are noted in the right upper lung.  No definite signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours appear normal.  Bony structures appear intact.  There is a tunneled
 screw in the right humeral head.  Calcific densities project over the right
 upper quadrant, corresponding with areas of embolization as seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny nodular densities in the right upper lung for which
 non-emergent CT may be performed to further assess.  No acute intrathoracic
 process.
