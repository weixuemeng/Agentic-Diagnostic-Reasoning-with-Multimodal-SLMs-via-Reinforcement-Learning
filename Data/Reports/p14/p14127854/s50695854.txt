 An NG tube is present, the tip lies approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There is rotated positioning with low inspiratory volumes.  This likely
 contributes to accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 17:13 p.m., the patchy opacity at the left base is
 slightly more pronounced.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
