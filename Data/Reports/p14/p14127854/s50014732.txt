                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fatigue, history of HCV, cirrhosis,
 TACE, hepatocellular carcinoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Low lung
 volumes significantly limit the evaluation.  Allowing for this,
 bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for the relative increase in
 bronchovascular opacities in the lower lungs.  No definite sign of pneumonia,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
 with top normal heart size.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
