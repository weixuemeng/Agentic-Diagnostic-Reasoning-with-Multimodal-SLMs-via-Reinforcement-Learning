 The lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace disease to
 suggest pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 There has been marked interval decrease in the amount of pneumoperitoneum with
 only a trace area of radiolucency underneath both hemidiaphragms.  The left
 hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated of uncertain significance.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is scattered air within
 non-distended loops of bowel.
