 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardio mediastinal silhouette is
 essentially unchanged. Opacification at the bases silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and and
 underlying compressive atelectasis. The pulmonary vascularity is essentially

 clinical setting it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia.
 Right IJ sheath remains in place.
