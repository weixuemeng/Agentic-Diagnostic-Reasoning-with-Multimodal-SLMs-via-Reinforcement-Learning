                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 patchy medial right base opacity likely represents combination of vascular
 structures and possibly atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
