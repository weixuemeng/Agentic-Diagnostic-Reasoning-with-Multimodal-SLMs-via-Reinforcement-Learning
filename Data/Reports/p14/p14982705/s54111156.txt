                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with heart failure symptoms, evaluate
 for possible pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The patient is status post sternotomy and
 previous bypass surgery.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The configuration
 is the same with some relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to
 the left and posteriorly.  Left atrial enlargement is also present but of more
 moderate degree.  Previously described coronary calcifications and multiple
 surgical clips related to bypass surgery appear unchanged.  Again noted is an
 upper zone re-distribution pattern with distended vessel in the upper
 pulmonary area and some interstitial edema on the bases with perivascular haze
 and a few peripheral lymph lines.  Also noted is accentuated visibility of
 both minor and major fissure related to some wetness in the pleural spaces. 
 There is evidence of some mild degree of chronic pulmonary congestion, may
 have increased slightly, but there is no significant advancement into
 interstitial edema and no central alveolar edema can be identified.  No new
 discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present.  No pneumothorax is
 seen in the apical area.  In comparison with the next previous examination of
 ___, there may be a mild degree of progression of CHF.  Same can
 be stated when comparison is extended to the chest examination of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild degree of chronic CHF in patient, moderate cardiomegaly
 status post bypass surgery.  No new acute infiltrates are seen and no major
 pleural effusions can be identified.
