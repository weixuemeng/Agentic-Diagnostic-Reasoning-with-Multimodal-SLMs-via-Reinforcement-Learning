                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload, renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior examination.  The
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  A new consolidation at the right lung
 base may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, although it appears out of
 proportion to only mild central pulmonary vascular congestion with relative
 lack of interstitial edema elsewhere.  A right internal jugular wide-bore
 catheter terminates at the level of the mid SVC.  A left anterior chest wall
 ICD remains in position with unchanged position of the intracardiac as well as
 a single extracardiac lead.  This extracardiac lead follows a somewhat
 tortuous path but is unchanged since at least ___.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New focal consolidation at the right lung base which may
 represent asymmetric edema, although it appears out of proportion to mild
 central vascular congestion and lack of interstitial edema favoring a
 diagnosis of pneumonia.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 11:40AM on ___ at time of initial review.
