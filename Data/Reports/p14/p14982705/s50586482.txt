                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy, aortic valve replacement,
 and likely coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  There is a three-lead
 pacemaker/ICD device, with leads terminating in the right atrium, right
 ventricle and coronary sinus, respectively, as before.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is a persistent reticulation at the lung
 bases and a right infrahilar opacity, but unchanged.  Fissures are minimally
 thickened, which could be seen with slight fluid overload.  The diaphragms are
 flattened.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative
 changes are present along the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest, with no acute findings, including
 mild predominantly basilar peripheral interstitial abnormality, although not
 widespread or striking.  This may be due to a degree of mild chronic pulmonary
 congestion among other potential causes.
