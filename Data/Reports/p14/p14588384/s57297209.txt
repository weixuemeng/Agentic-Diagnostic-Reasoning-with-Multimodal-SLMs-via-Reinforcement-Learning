                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Both lungs demonstrate no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild opacification within the lung bases posteriorly on the
 lateral view most likely in the left lung base which may represent
 atelectasis, however infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
