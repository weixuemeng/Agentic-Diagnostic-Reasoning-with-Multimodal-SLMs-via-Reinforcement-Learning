                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  In review of subsequent imaging, the opacity projecting over the
 right breast, initially thought to reflect a nipple shadow, represents a
 rounded consolidation. This is confirmed on the lateral view. Please refer to
 the subsequent CTA chest for further details.
