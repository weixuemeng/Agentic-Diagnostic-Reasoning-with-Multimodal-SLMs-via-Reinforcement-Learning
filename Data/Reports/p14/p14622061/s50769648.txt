                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistence of cough > month  // please
 evaluate      please evaluate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The lung volumes are low.  Both upper lobes show areas of
 parenchymal scarring and subtle small nodular opacities.  The presence of
 bilateral apical infectious or post infectious changes must be suspected. 
 Given that this region is difficult to assess on chest radiographs, CT is
 recommended to further workup these lung parenchymal changes.  The mid and
 lower portions of the lungs are unremarkable.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT is recommended to clarify both nodular and interstitial
 right and left upper lobe changes.
