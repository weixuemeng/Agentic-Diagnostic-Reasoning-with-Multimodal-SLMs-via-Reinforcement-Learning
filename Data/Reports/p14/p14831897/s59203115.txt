                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for acute process in a patient with nausea, vomiting,
 diarrhea, and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a mildly enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, unchanged compared to ___.  Diffusely increased opacity
 bilaterally is consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally, slightly
 increased opacity in the right lower lung is likely atelectasis.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable, except for clips in the right upper
 quadrant suggestive of prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Linear opacity in the right lower lung is likely atelectasis.
