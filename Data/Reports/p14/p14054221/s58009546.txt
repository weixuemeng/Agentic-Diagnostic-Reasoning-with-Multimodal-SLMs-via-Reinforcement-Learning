                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after surgery with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for opacity projecting over the right mid lower lung most likely
 reflecting atelectasis, but potentially consolidation in right middle lobe or
 right lower lobe.  Correlation with lateral view would be beneficial.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
