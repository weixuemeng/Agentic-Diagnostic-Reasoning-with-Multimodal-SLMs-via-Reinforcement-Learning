 AP CHEST, 6:34 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis.  CHF.  Confusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:  
 
 Large right pleural effusion has remained stable since ___.  There is
 extensive new opacification in the left lung in a generally perihilar
 distribution, most readily explained by pulmonary edema though pulmonary
 hemorrhage and pneumonia could be contributory.  Heart is enlarged, but hard
 to assess because of adjacent right pleural effusion.  Right jugular line ends
 in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
