                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new weight gain, ascites, dyspnea, evaluate
 for consolidation or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Calcific density
 following the peripheral margin of the heart likely reflects calcifications
 within the pericardium.  Cardiomediastinal contours otherwise normal.  Lungs
 are symmetrically expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires and multiple surgical clips projecting over
 the heart are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.
