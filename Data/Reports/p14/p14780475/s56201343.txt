                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF now with desats.  Pulmonary edema or infiltrates?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is severe kyphosis which limits the assessment.  Cardiac size appears
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.  No focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Streaky opacities at the right hilum
 as well as the base consistent with atelectasis.  Suprahilar opacities
 projecting over the right upper lobe are thought to represent costochondral
 degenerative changes rather than parenchymal changes.  Generalized bony
 demineralization is present.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No overt evidence of pneumonia.
