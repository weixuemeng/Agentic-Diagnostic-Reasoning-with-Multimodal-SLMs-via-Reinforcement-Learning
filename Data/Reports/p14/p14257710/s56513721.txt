                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Evaluate postoperative effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small-to-moderate right and small dependent left pleural effusions are stable.
 Lateral view shows substantial anterior fluid collection that could be in the
 mediastinum or anterior pleural space, probably left-sided.  If the patient
 has clinical evidence of blood loss or infection, I would recommend CT
 scanning to localize sampling.  A nodule in the left upper lobe, obscured
 today by a metallic snap, is smaller than it was on ___ when it first
 appeared.  Although I do not see a pleural tube in that location, it could be
 an artifact from thoracostomy.  Careful followup advised.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is normal size.  There is no pulmonary edema, and no
 pneumothorax.
