                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p cabg  // eval for effusion      eval
 for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the lower lungs and hemidiaphragms
 are better seen.  This could reflect improved pleural effusions and
 atelectasis, though some of it may merely be a manifestation of a more upright
 position of the patient.
 Streaks of atelectasis are seen in the mid to lower zones bilaterally. 
 Pulmonary vessels are mildly indistinct, suggesting some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Central catheter is unchanged.
