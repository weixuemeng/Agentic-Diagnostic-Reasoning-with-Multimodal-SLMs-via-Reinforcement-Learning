                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of gastric carcinoma on chemoradiation, now with fever. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, ___, at ___, as well as a CT course of dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  Streaky bibasilar
 atelectasis is noted.  A rounded opacity is seen overlying the left lower
 lobe, which may represent a nipple shadow although a parenchymal opacity
 cannot be excluded.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Rounded opacity overlying the left lower lobe. Recommend oblique views
 with nipple markers to further characterize the opacity.
