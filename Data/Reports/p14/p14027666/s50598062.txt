                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette.
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits, and there is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities are noted in the lung bases,
 possibly atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection
 or aspiration are not excluded.
