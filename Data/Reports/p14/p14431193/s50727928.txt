                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fall and tachypnea.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding.  No
 focal parenchymal opacities are identified.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are intact.  There is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic free
 air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiographic examination.  No fractures
 identified.  However, as this examination has limited sensitivity for
 detection of rib fractures, dedicated rib views should be obtained if there is
 further concern.
