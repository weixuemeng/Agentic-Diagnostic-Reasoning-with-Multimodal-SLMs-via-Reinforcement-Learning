                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hx of dementia p/w worsening confusion  // r/o
 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Given low lung volumes,
 evaluation is limited. Allowing for this, no convincing signs of pneumonia,
 effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to assess. Mediastinal
 contour is slightly prominent likely reflecting on full but thoracic aorta.
 Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study without definite signs of acute intrathoracic process. If there
 is strong clinical concern, would recommend repeat with more optimal
 inspiratory effort.
