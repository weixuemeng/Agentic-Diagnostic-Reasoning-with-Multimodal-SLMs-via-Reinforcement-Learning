                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, four days of throat tightness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Prominent breast
 tissue.  Underpenetration of the lower lungs.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Subtle haziness along the right
 heart border is not confirmed on the lateral view and therefore likely
 reflects the overlying soft tissues/breast.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
