                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with atrial fibrillation with  rapid ventricular
 rate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Re- demonstrated are diffuse
 ill-defined nodular opacities compatible with bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
 with bronchial wall thickening, thought to be due to chronic nontuberculous
 mycobacterium infection, perhaps slightly worse in the interval.  No pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild to
 moderate multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and bronchiolitis
 compatible chronic nontuberculous mycobacterium infection, slightly worse in
 the interval.
