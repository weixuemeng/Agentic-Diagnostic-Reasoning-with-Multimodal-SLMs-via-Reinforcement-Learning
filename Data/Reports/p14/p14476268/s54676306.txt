                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ at 23:08 and
 outside hospital chest radiograph from ___ at 16:57.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities in the lung bases
 correspond with areas of subsegmental atelectasis seen on concurrent CT.  No
 confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  A subcentimeter
 pulmonary nodule seen on concurrent CT is not well visualized on this
 radiographic examination.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis
