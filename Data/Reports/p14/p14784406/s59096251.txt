                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place, terminating in the right apical
 region.  A very small right apical lateral pneumothorax is newly identified. 
 Worsening relatively homogeneous opacity is present in the right mid and lower
 lungs, probably a combination of enlarging right pleural effusion and adjacent
 lung parenchymal consolidation and/or atelectasis.  Within the left lung,
 there is slightly worsening atelectasis at the left base as well as a small
 left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apicolateral pneumothorax with chest tube in place. 
 Enlarging right pleural effusion with adjacent worsening right mid and lower
 lung opacities.
