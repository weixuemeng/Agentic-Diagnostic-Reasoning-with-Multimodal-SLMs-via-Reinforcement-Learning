                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, right chest tube
 is in place and the ipsilateral lung has substantially re-expanded with a
 small residual pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contents are now in normal position
 though there is some continued increased opacification in the left lung.  Tip
 of the endotracheal tube is now properly positioned about 4 cm above the
 carina.
