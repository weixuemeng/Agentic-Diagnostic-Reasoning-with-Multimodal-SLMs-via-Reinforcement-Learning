                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable radiograph of chest was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is seen to course into the right main
 bronchus, and there is a moderate-to-large right pneumothorax causing a
 partial collapse of right lung and some element of tension in the form of mild
 mediastinal shift to the left side.  Increased opacity in the left lung is due
 to the poor aeration from selective intubation of the right bronchus.  Heart
 size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Selective intubation of the right main bronchus with right-sided
 tension pneumothorax.  The findings are discussed by Dr. ___ with the
 clinical team on ___ at 4:48 p.m.
