                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CVA tenderness, UTI.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left base
 opacity likely represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis with
 underlying consolidation.  Right base opacity is seen which may be due to
 atelectasis and possible consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis with consolidation.  Patchy right base opacity may be a second
 focus of consolidation versus possible atelectasis.
