                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and productive cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study. This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is top normal. Aorta is mildly tortuous
 and demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. Minimal linear atelectasis is seen in the
 lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
