                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain, fever  // eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are grossly clear
 except for a smoothly marginated 1.6 cm diameter opacity overlying the right
 fourth anterior rib, very likely due to a nipple shadow.  As a lateral
 radiograph was not obtained, and as in this appears asymmetrical compared to
 the left side, a repeat radiograph with nipple markers is suggested to confirm
 this is a nipple and not a lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  Repeat radiograph with nipple markers is
 recommended to confirm a presumed nipple shadow on the right as described
 above.
