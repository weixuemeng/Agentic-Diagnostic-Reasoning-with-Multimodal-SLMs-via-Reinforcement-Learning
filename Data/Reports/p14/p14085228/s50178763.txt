 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. The cardiac silhouette appears
 enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although percardial effusion should
 also be considered.. The lungs appear clear. The hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is in position, with leads
 ending in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Stable cardiac enlargement.
