                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, likely due
 to mild congestion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy left perihilar opacity appears chronic and
 probably due to minor scarring from prior surgery or infection.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The heart size is normal.  The
 patient is status post an aortic valve replacement and probable coronary
 bypass surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mild vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
