                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a very mild interstitial abnormality including
 peribronchial cuffing, an appearance which may be associated with mild
 congestion among other causes.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement with
 sternotomy.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interstitial abnormality which, in overall context,
 probably reflects mild pulmonary vascular congestion, although atypical
 infection or bronchial inflammation could have a similar appearance.
