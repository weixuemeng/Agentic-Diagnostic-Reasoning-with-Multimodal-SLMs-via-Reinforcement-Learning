 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:

 most suggestive of nipple shadows.  There is no effusion or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Minor
 atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular opacities projecting over
 the lung bases suggestive of nipple shadows but should be confirmed with
 repeat frontal view with nipple markers in place.
