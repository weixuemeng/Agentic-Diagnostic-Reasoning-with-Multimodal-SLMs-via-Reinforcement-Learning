                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nonproductive cough for three months, remote smoking history. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal increase in
 density of the retrocardiac lung region, potentially reflecting the presence
 of a small hiatal hernia.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left lung bases, seen on both the lateral and the frontal radiograph.  No
 acute lung disease, in particular no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
