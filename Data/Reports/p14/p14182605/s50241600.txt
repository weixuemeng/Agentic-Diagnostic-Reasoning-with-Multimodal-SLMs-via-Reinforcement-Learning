 appears volume up on exam.  // ? pulm edema     ? pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 02:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size of a left pleural effusion which likely has a
 loculated component laterally.  There is stable retrocardiac consolidation
 consistent with compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Overall, there is
 increasing pulmonary vascular indistinctness and worsening opacity in the left
 mid lung favoring asymmetric pulmonary edema, athough an infectious process in
 the left mid lung should also be considered.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  Status post median sternotomy.  Given patient rotation, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are essentially stable.  No pneumothorax.
