                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with SOB  // eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small left pleural effusion and probable trace right pleural
 effusion.  Possible trace right pleural effusion is noted.  Increased
 interstitial markings are seen bilaterally, particularly at the bases.  This
 could be in part due to atelectasis given effusions although chronic
 interstitial process or potentially aspiration is possible.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the aortic arch. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Increased interstitial
 markings at the bases potentially atelectasis noting that infection or
 aspiration would be difficult to exclude.
