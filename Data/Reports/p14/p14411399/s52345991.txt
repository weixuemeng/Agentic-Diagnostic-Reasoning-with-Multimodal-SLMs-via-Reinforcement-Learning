                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchiectasis and from MAC now on antibiotics for ___ year.  Evaluate
 for improvement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. 
 Chest CT without contrast ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: Extensive, accentuated and dilated bronchi, most predominant in the
 right lung, are unchanged.  There is slight improvement in aeration of the
 right lung base.  Hyperinflation of the left lung is stable.  There is no
 focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 A nodule seen in the right upper lung is thought to correspond to an area of
 scarring seen on the prior chest CT (601B:14 on that study). 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: Severe right lower lobe bronchiectasis without a focal
 consolidation and improved aeration of the right lung base.
