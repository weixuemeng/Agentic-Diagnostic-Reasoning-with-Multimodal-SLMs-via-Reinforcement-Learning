                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with non-small cell lung cancer  // assessment of
 R pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:44, the moderate-size right-sided effusion
 has increased.  There is likely underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 There is possible increased retrocardiac otic opacity, and obscuration of left
 costophrenic angle is new, though this appearance is likely accentuated by
 overlying soft tissues on the frontal view.
 
 There is increased vascular plethora.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 Increased opacity at the left base is probably accentuated by overlying soft
 tissues, but the possibility of a very small left effusion and left base
 atelectasis/early infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 Increased vascular plethora, consistent with CHF/fluid overload.
