 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stage IV NSCLC with right pleural effusion
 s/p pleurx placement  // s/p pleurx placement, ? pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-___ from ___ at 09:42

 obvious pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Mild vascular plethora and
 previously seen retrocardiac opacity are improved.  Minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle noted, without gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided catheter with decrease in size of the
 previously seen right pleural effusion.  Underlying atelectasis noted.  No
 obvious pneumothorax.Possibility of a small occult pneumothorax is not
 entirely excluded.
 
 Interval improvement in vascular plethora and retrocardiac opacity.
