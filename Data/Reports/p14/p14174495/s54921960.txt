                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Note is made that the previous (___ 10:44 a.m.) chest x-ray
 showed an area of serpiginous increased density in the proximal diaphysis of
 the left humerus.  This is not fully characterized radiographically, but the
 most likely differential is an enchondroma versus a bone infarct.  If
 clinically indicated, dedicated left humeral radiographs and, more fully, left
 humerus MRI could help for further characterization.  This could certainly be
 deferred until the patient is stable and able to tolerate additional imaging
 examinations.
