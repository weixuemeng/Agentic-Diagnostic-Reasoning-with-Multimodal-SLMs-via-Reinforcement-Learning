                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  r/o pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased density at the right lung base consistent with atelectasis
 or consolidation.  The right costophrenic angle is indistinct.  The left lung
 is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart appears large but cardiac size
 may be exaggerated by AP technique.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal
 structures are otherwise unremarkable. There are no concerning bone findings.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density at the right base consistent with atelectasis or
 consolidation.  Evidence for small right effusion.
