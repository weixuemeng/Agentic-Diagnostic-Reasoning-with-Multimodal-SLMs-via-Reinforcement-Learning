                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, new a-fib RVR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild pulmonary edema is present with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities
 in lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, however infection cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
