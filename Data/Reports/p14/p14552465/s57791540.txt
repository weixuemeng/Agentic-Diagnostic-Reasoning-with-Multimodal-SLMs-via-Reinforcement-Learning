                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacing device has been placed in the interval with a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The generator pack is in the left
 anterior chest.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Heart is enlarged, but
 there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes have improved since the
 prior study and a right basilar opacity has nearly resolved with only minimal
 residual linear atelectasis remaining.  Probable very small pleural effusions
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pacing lead within the right ventricle.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
