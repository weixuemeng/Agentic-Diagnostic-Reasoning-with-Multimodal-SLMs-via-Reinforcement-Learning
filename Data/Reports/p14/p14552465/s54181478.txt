                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new oxygen requirement of unclear etiology,
 rule out acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest view was reviewed.  The radiograph
 was read in comparison with prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Because of the gross rotation, assessment of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited.  A vague opacity in the right
 lower lung could be function of rotation and low lung volumes or true
 abnormality secondary to a combination of atelectasis and/or small pleural
 effusion.  Right upper and left lung are without opacities of concern.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
