                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacemaker device appears unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is patchy left basilar density, as seen previously. but
 possibly due to normal bronchovascular structures or minor atelectasis. 
 Pneumonia is doubtful.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary disease.  If pulmonary symptoms
 are present and were to persist, or if there were to continue to be an
 unexplained potential source for fever, radiographs could be considered with
 standard PA and lateral technique.
