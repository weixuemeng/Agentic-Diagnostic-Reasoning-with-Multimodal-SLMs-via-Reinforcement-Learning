                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pleural effusion versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is opacification at the
 right base with meniscus formation, consistent with a substantial right
 pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.  No vascular
 congestion or definite acute focal pneumonia.  The hiatal hernia seen on the
 previous study is difficult to assess on the current examination.
