                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, s/p thoracentesis.  // Interval
 improvement in pleural effusion? any evidence of pneumothorax?      Interval
 improvement in pleural effusion? any evidence of pn
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a thoracentesis on the
 right with substantial reduction in pleural fluid and no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Opacification at the right base is consistent with some
 combination of residual pleural effusion, atelectasis, and re-expansion edema
 of the previously collapsed portion of the lower right lung.
 There is some increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels.  This could
 reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though it also could be a
 manifestation of the AP supine view when compared to the previous erect PA
 projection.
