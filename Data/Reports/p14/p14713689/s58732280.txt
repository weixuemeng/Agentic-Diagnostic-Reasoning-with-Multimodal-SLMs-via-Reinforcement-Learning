                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness and dizziness, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided demonstrating no
 confluent consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  There is probable mild
 atelectasis in the lower lungs which appears similar to prior exam.
 Superimposed breast tissue may account for the subtle lower lung opacities
 seen on this radiograph as well as the prior radiograph of the chest. Please
 note, given this appearance, a very early pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  As seen on prior exams, subtle lower lung opacities likely
 represent atelectasis versus superimposed breast tissue though an early
 pneumonia is impossible to exclude.
