                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible stroke.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall, there are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there is mild right basilar opacity which may be due to
 atelectasis although underlying infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No focal consolidation is seen on the left. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Subtle right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis
 although mild infection or underlying aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
