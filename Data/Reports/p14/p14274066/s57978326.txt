                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset diabetes and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views of the chest.  The study is limited by overlying soft tissues and low
 lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is normal size and slightly rotated. 
 Bronchovascular crowding is likely due to poor inspiratory volume.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 Spinal stabilization rods across multiple thoracic levels are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study with no evidence for pneumonia.
