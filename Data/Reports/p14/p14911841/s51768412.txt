                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Three AP portable views of the chest are provided.
 
 FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Bones are intact.  
 
 Along the right side of the thorax and extending to the neck, there is
 subcutaneous emphysema from an unclear etiology. No definite pneumothorax is
 seen, query subtle right pneumothorax; the subcutaneous air could be a sign
 that one is present and we are not as well appreciating it on this portable
 radiograph - inspiratory/expiratory films may help in the differentiation.
 Linear atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subcutaneous air tracking along the right neck and right chest
 wall.  Query subtle right pneumothorax.  Inspiratory/expiratory films may help
 in the delineating a pneumothorax if one exists.  Findings were discussed with
 Dr. ___ in the ___ after the conclusion of the study on ___.
