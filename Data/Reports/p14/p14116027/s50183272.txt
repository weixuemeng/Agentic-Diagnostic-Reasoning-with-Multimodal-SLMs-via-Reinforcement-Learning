 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded
 and clear.  A patchy new left basilar opacity suggests atelectasis but is not
 specific.  A left chest Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Right third and fourth rib
 fractures were already present before.

 Patchy new left basilar opacity, probably atelectasis but not specific.
