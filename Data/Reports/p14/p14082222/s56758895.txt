                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Massive cardiomegaly is demonstrated, not substantially changed from the prior
 study.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Lungs are hyperinflated with unchanged
 moderate paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema again noted.  Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is worse in the interval.  Pulmonary arteries
 remain enlarged suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse in the interval, superimposed on a
 background of moderate emphysema.  Severe cardiomegaly and evidence of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
