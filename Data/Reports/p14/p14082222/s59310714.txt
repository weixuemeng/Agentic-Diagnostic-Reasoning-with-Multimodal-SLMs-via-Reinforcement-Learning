                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again is substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal if any elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  This discrepancy raises the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia, though the area behind the heart is
 difficult to assess in the absence of a lateral view.
