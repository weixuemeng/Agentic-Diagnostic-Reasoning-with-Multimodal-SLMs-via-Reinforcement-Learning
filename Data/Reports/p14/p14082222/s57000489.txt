                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper extremity cellulitis and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged allowing
 for differences in technique, including a convex contour to the right upper
 mediastinum, which is commonly due to tortuosity of great vessels.  There is
 no focal opacification.  The interstitium is again mildly coarse, but similar
 to baseline.  Fissures are mildly thickened as best depicted on the lateral
 view and there are also trace posterior pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload.
