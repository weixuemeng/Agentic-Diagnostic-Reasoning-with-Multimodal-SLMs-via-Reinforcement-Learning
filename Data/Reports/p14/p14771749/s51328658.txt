                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of palpitations.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  Increased retrocardiac opacity with less distinctness
 of the lateral border of the thoracic aorta since ___ probably reflects
 increasing atelectasis in the setting of new elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm which supports volume loss.  However, underlying infection in
 the appropriate clinical scenario cannot be completely excluded.  Slightly
 increased opacity in the right lower hemithorax on the frontal view may
 reflect positional changes.  A right lower lobe subpleural nodule is better
 appreciated on the CT from ___.  The heart remains moderate to severely
 enlarged, similar to the prior exam.  Mediastinal contours and position of the
 trachea on the frontal view are also similar to the prior CT from ___. 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No frank pulmonary edema.  Degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine are extensive in the bones appear relatively
 demineralized, unchanged.  Surgical clips in the left upper abdomen are new
 from the prior chest radiographs, but present on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased retrocardiac opacity with new elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is probably increasing atelectasis; however, underlying
 pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.
 
 2.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly, unchanged.  No pulmonary edema or
 effusion.
 
 3.  Please see CT report of ___ for recommendation of nodule
 follow-up.
