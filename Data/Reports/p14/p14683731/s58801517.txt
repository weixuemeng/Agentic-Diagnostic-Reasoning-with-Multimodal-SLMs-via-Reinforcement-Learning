                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fall.  Evaluate for evidence of
 trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  Lung
 volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or large pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable from the most recent prior.  No displaced
 rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intrathoracic trauma. Note, conventional
 radiography is not the best study to evaluate for chest cage injury. If there
 are focal findings, detailed views of those areas should be obtained with
 consideration for CT if clinically indicated.
