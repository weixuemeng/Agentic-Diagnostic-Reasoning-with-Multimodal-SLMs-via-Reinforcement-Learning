                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pneumoperitoneum, presumably from recent gastrostomy tube placement

 Probable small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased right basilar opacification, most likely atelectasis.
 
 2. Pneumoperitoneum, stable and likely related to recent gastrostomy tube
 placement.  However, its persistence raises question of a leak.
