 evidence of acute infiltrates are remaining.  General appearance of lungs with
 low positioned and flattened diaphragms, irregular distribution of pulmonary
 vasculature on the periphery with increased interstitial markings mostly on
 the left base remain and are rather typical for advanced COPD.  No
 pneumothorax in the apical area.
