                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia with ambulation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  New focal opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe
 and the left lower lobe as well as tiny bilateral pleural effusions are
 concerning for pneumonia.  The heart and mediastinal surfaces are normal.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Hyperinflated lungs and flattened hemidiaphragms
 are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left upper and lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragms consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.
