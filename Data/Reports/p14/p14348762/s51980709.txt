                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cp, sob.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar opacities are seen and are suggestive of
 atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous. The hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  There is no evidence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Multiple chronic appearing right-sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis
 however infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
