                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of past medical history of suicidal ideations who
 presents with TCA ingestion.  Patient is currently intubated.  Please evaluate
 for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal. There is mild bilateral perihilar
 fullness, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 There is a large consolidation at the right lower lobe as well as diffuse
 opacities throughout the right upper lung. Mild peribronchiolar cuffing with
 interstitial thickening is seen at the left lung base, consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  There is likely a moderate right pleural effusion. Note is
 made of a subtle increase in lucency at the left lung base. ET tube terminates
 approximately 6.1 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large consolidation at the right lung base with diffuse opacities seen
 throughout the right upper lung is concerning for pneumonia. Moderate right
 pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema, with evidence of peribronchiolar cuffing at the left
 lung base.
 
 3.  Subtle increased lucency at the left lung base is concerning for a
 possible anterior pneumothorax. When clinically able, an upright film would be
 recommended for further evaluation.
 
 4.  ET tube terminates appropriately approximately 6.1 cm above the carina.
