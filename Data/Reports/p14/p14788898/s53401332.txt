                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TCA overdose, large aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm off film.  A
 right IJ central line is present, tip overlying the distal SVC.  
 
 Slightly low inspiratory volumes.  There is upper zone redistribution
 suggestive of CHF.  The previously seen dense opacity and layering effusion at
 the right base shows some interval clearing, without gross effusion visible on
 the current exam.  There is, however, some faint patchy interstitial opacity
 in the right lung, asymmetric to the left, raising the question of a
 background infiltrate. There is some patchy opacity at the left base, but this
 also appears slightly improved compared with the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Residual opacity at right lung, with evidence of interval improvement. 
 Also, improvement in the left base.
 
 2) ? faint backgroun  interstial infiltrate in right lung.   
 
 3) Question mild vascular plethora.
