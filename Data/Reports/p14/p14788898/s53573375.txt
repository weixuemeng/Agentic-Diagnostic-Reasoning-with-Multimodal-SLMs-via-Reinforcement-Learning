                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure status post TCA overdose, status post
 intubation, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared to prior study, and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  A right IJ
 central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  
 
 There is upper zone re-distribution and probable mild CHF.  There is opacity
 throughout much of the right lung, with more confluent opacity and air
 bronchograms at the right lung base and with obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm, likely with a right effusion.  There is also patchy opacity at
 the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant change compared with ___.
