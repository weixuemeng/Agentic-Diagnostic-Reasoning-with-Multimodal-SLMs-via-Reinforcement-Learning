 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic heart failure.  Home PICC

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is even more pronounced, but lungs are clear and pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Right PIC
 line passes at least as far as the origin of the SVC where it is obscured by
 both a transvenous pacer defibrillator lead, which ends high in the right
 ventricle, and a superficial EKG lead.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 abnormality.
