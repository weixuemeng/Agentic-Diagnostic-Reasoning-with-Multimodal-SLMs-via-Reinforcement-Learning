                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  The
 right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  Aortic stent grafting is again seen in
 the descending aorta.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Again, there is right apical pleural thickening/scarring, stable in appearance
 as compared to the prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.  Additionally, there may be partial
 collapse of the right middle lobe, similar compared to prior, with related
 pleural effusion.
