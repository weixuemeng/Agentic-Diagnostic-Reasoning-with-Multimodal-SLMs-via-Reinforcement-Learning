                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with previously treated lung cancer
 and increased dullness over left lung.  Question larger effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Comparison demonstrates stable chest
 findings.  Thus, there is status post aortic stent grafting in the entire
 descending aorta, old radiation treatment scar formations in right upper lobe
 status post malignancy treatment and right-sided pleural thickenings and scar
 formations.  The left lung base remains clear and there is no evidence of
 left-sided pleural effusion as the pleural sinus remains free.  The extensive
 right-sided pleural densities remain unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new left-sided pleural effusion.  Prominence of
 the heart within the left hemithorax may explain the observed increased
 dullness over the left base.
