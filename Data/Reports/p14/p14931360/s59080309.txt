                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to previous exam, there has been no significant interval
 change.  Again seen is volume loss in the right hemithorax with increased
 density in the right paratracheal region.  Some of this is likely due to
 post-radiation changes.  There is no visualized pneumothorax on the current
 exam.  Right basilar Pleurx catheter remains in place with some fluid within
 the major fissure, unchanged.  The left lung remains grossly clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Stents again identified in the
 descending thoracic and upper abdominal aorta.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Presumably in part
 post-treatment changes with volume loss in the right Pleurx catheter and right
 paramediastinal soft tissue density.
