 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracoscopy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after right
 thoracoscopy.  Right pigtail catheter has been inserted into the pleural
 space.  There is a large basal and minimal apical post-procedural pneumothorax
 without evidence of tension.  Pre-existing pleural effusion on the right has
 decreased and a cavitary component of a left upper lobe consolidation is
 better seen than on the previous image.  The width of the mediastinum on the
 right has slightly decreased.
 
 On the left, there is blunting of the costophrenic sinus, likely associated
 with a small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta that that is stented.
