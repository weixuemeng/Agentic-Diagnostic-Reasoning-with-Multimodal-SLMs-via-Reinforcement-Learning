                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly re- demonstrated, with diffuse calcification and
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Graft stent within the descending thoracic
 aorta is in unchanged position.  Opacity within the right paramediastinal
 upper lung is unchanged compatible with known radiation changes for non-small
 cell lung cancer.  No overt pulmonary edema is identified.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged.  Left basilar opacification is
 new, and is compatible with the presence of a small to moderate left pleural
 effusion and probable adjacent atelectasis. A left basilar infectious process
 is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent moderate size right pleural effusion. New small to moderate sized
 left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity either reflecting atelectasis
 or possibly infection.  Unchanged post radiation treatment changes within the
 right upper paramediastinal lung.
