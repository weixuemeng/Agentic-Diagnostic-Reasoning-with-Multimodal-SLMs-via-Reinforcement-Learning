                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pleurex catheter with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged with dense mitral annular
 calcifications.  The aorta is tortuous with a stent graft noted within the
 descending thoracic aorta as well as within the upper abdominal aorta.  Medial
 right upper lobe opacity is compatible with postradiation changes, and appears
 similar compared to the recent exam.  Small right apical pneumothorax appears
 relatively unchanged.  The right basal pleurex catheter is again noted, with a
 moderate size pleural effusion, increased in the interval.  There is adjacent
 right basilar atelectasis.  No left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion which is now moderate
 in size.  Small right apical pneumothorax, unchanged.
 
 2.  Unchanged post radiation changes within the medial aspect of the right
 upper lobe.
