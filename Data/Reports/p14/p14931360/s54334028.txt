                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of non-small cell lung cancer, now with worsening
 dyspnea, here to evaluate for increased pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is improved
 aeration at the left lung base with mild blunting at the left costophrenic
 angle compatible with decreased size of small left pleural effusion from
 ___.  There is elevation of the right hemithorax compared to the left.  A
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Opacity at the right
 paratracheal stripe and lung apex is unchanged, compatible with radiation
 changes of non-small cell lung cancer.  No pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable.  There is diffuse
 calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with a graft stent in the
 descending thoracic aorta, as before.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration of the left lung base with decreased size of small left
 pleural effusion and improving atelectasis.
 2.  Persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 3.  Unchanged post-radiation changes of the right paratracheal lung.
