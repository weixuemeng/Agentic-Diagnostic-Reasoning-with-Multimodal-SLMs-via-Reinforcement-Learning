                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged,
 with a descending thoracic aortic stent graft re- demonstrated.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and dilated, but similar in appearance compared to the
 previous exam. Rightward deviation of the upper trachea is due to the presence
 of a thyroid goiter. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right upper
 lobe paramediastinal opacity compatible with radiation changes is unchanged. 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated.  Mild atelectatic
 changes are noted in the lung bases.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little interval change compared to the previous exam.  Persistent moderate
 size right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.  Post radiation
 changes in the medial right upper lobe. Dilated and tortuous aorta status post
 descending thoracic aortic stent graft.
