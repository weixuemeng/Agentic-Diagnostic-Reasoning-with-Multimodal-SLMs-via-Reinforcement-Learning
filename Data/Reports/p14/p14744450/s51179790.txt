                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-Whipple for cholangiocarcinoma, assessing interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an ET tube terminating 2.5 cm
 from the carina.  There has also been interval placement of an enteric tube
 with distal tip not visualized but coursing below the diaphragm.  Right PICC
 line is seen with tip terminating in the upper SVC. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable. Despite interval intubation, lung volumes are lower
 than on the previous chest radiograph, which account for apparent slight
 increase in bilateral linear opacities. There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of ET tube with lower lung volumes than on
 the most recent prior chest radiograph. No other change from most recent
 prior.
