                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the central catheter has been
 removed.  There is some opacification at the left base, most likely reflecting
 post-operative atelectatic change.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.
 
 Impression on the lower right side of the cervical trachea suggests a thyroid
 mass.
