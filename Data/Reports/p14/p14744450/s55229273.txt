                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The right upper
 extremity PICC line is again seen with its tip residing in the low SVC.  There
 are bilateral pleural effusions, small in size with mild compressive lower
 lung atelectasis.  There is retrocardiac opacity which could also represent
 pneumonia, though overall findings appear improved from prior exam.  The mid
 to upper lungs are well aerated.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with retrocardiac opacity
 likely representing atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia.  PICC line
 positioned appropriately.
