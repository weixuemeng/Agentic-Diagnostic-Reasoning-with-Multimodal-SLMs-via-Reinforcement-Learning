                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cholangiocarcinoma status post Whipple, now
 with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 In the setting of the low lung volumes, there is minimal increase in density
 of the parenchyma at the left base, with a morphology more consistent with
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increased density of the parenchyma at the left base
 likely consistent with atelectasis.
