                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation of upper enteric tube placement in a patient with
 painless jaundice, mid CBD stricture, cholangiocarcinoma now status post
 Whipple procedure complicated by SBO and pancreatic leak.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Upright frontal chest radiographs demonstrate an upper enteric tube
 ending in the body of the stomach.  The right-sided PICC line ends in the
 upper to mid superior vena cava.  A tubular structure overlying the left upper
 chest extends cephalad and in the absence of an existing chest tube this may
 represent oxygen tubing for mask or nasal cannula that was present during the
 examination.  There are multiple millimetric densities in the right mid lung
 that likely represent granulomas. Otherwise, there is no consolidaiton,
 pleural effusions or obvious pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 The upper enteric tube ends in the body of the stomach.
