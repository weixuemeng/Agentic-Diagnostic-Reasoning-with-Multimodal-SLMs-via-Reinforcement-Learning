                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess NG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 An NG tube is present, new compared with ___.  The tip is difficult to
 trace beyond the level of the lower mediastinum, though this could be due to
 technical factors.   
 
 A right PICC line, with tip over proximal SVC, is again noted.  No
 pneumothorax detected.  The left pleural effusion is smaller or resolved and
 there is residual left base atelectasis, which is improved compared with the
 prior study.  No CHF or focal infiltrate identified.
