                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, status post AAA repair, increasing O2 requirement.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  Compared with ___ at 18:51 p.m.
 
 A right IJ central line is present, tip over SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  
 
 There is background COPD with hyperinflation and cardiomegaly.  
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density and a small left effusion.  The
 effusion is probably slightly larger. Adjoining subcutaneous emphysema
 slightly improved.
 
 There is a small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 which appears new.  
 
 Smooth bordered hazy ovoid density in the left paratracheal region is noted,
 unchanged compared with ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and suspected background COPD.
 2.  Small-to-moderate left effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, slightly more pronounced than on ___.  
 3.  Small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation appears
 new.
 4.  Left paratracheal opacity, unchanged compared with ___, not fully
 characterized.  Most likely etiology includes vascular ectasia or aneurysmal
 dilatation or a goiter.  If clinically indicated, cross-sectional imaging
 could help to more completely characterize this.
 5.  Subcutaneous emphysema along left chest wall decreased.  Clinical
 correlation is requested, as the etiology for this is uncertain.
