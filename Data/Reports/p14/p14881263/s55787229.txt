                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Open aortic aneurysm repair.  Bilateral iliac grafts, evaluation
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:47 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged bilateral basal
 opacities, left more than right, suggestive of atelectasis.  Presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the lung
 parenchyma is unremarkable.  No pneumothorax, no pneumomediastinum.  Two
 linear lucencies projecting over the left lung apex are caused by skin folds.
 
 The right internal jugular vein catheter is in constant position.
