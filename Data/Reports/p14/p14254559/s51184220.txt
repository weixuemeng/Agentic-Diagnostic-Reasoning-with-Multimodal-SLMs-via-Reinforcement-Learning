 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with rising white count and desaturation,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right infrahilar, and left basilar opacity is unchanged, with a
 small left pleural effusion also unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette remains

 There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are notable only for a
 tortuous aorta.  A pigtail catheter is noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar, and left basilar opacity, which could reflect
 pneumonia and/or atelectasis.  There is a small associated left pleural
 effusion. Recommend repeat dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph upon
 improvement in symptoms to document resolution.
