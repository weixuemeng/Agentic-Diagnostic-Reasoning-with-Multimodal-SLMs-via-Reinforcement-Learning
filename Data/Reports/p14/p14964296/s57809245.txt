                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, hypoxemia  // Please assess for PNA,
 effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  A poorly defined area of
 consolidation within the right lower lobe posteriorly is new.  Multifocal
 poorly defined nodular opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree
 than the right are unchanged since the recent study of ___ when
 consideration is given to larger lung volumes on the current exam.  Bilateral
 bronchial wall thickening is also demonstrated as well as apparent areas of
 tubular opacification which could potentially represent regions of mucoid
 impaction.  The described lung and airway findings are new compared to a more
 remote study of ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Poorly defined nodular opacities accompanied by a more focal consolidation in
 the right lower lobe, concerning for multifocal infection.  Considering
 history of immune suppression, an opportunistic infection should be
 considered.  Further evaluation by CT would be helpful to more fully
 characterize these findings.  .
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 9:38 AM, 25 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
