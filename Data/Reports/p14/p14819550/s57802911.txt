                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Pleural calcifications are
 noted at the pleura bilaterally, right more than left.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the right shoulder are
 again noted.  They might include loose bodies in the shoulder joint.
 
 The calcifications were not clearly seen on prior examination but most likely
 due to slightly different projection of the radiograph.
