                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cardiac catheterization stents, now with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal, pleural and pulmonary structures are unremarkable. 
 Haziness of the left heart border likely relates to mediastinal fat as seen on
 previous CT.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  Midline sternotomy wires and CABG
 clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
