                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intermittent sputum production x 1 month
 and night sweats, history of treatment for posisitve PPD  // rule out active
 tb or pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2 centimeter-sized ring shadows projecting over the inferior margin of the
 interior right second rib look artifactual. I would recommend a repeat frontal
 chest radiograph of the patient fully dystrophic to the waist. If the findings
 persist shallow oblique view should be obtained to determine if the findings
 are in the bone or alternatively in the right upper lobe where they might be
 small cavities. Lungs are fully expanded and otherwise clear.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
