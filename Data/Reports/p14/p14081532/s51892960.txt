                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cardiomyopathy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  The left lower lung
 nodular opacities are noted and potentially reflect the sequela of the prior
 more extensive opacity seen on the prior chest radiograph.  No new
 consolidations demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
