                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p intubation eval for ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube projects approximately 6 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 terminates in the left upper quadrant.  Heart size is within normal limits. 
 Interrupted appearance of the aortic arch calcification is unchanged from a
 prior radiograph.  Mild bilateral hilar fullness may be secondary to
 lymphadenopathy or vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Satisfactory position of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2.  Bilateral hilar fullness suggestive of hilar congestion though difficult
 to exclude lymphadenopathy.
