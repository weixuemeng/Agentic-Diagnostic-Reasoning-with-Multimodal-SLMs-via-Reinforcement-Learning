                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure, intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage and pneumonia.  Please evaluate for progression.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiographs with the most recent from ___, acquired approximately
 ___ hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 8 cm above the carina and right internal jugular line
 tip is in the mid SVC.  Over the last approximately 17 hours,  consolidation
 in the right lower lung and mild to moderately severe pulmonary edema have
 improved.  Small right and presumed minimal left pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  Heart size is top normal and stable.  There is no mediastinal
 widening or hilar prominence.  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm
 into the stomach; however, its distal end is off radiographic view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over last 17 hours, mild to moderately severe pulmonary edema and
 right lower lung consolidation, presumably pneumonia have improved.
