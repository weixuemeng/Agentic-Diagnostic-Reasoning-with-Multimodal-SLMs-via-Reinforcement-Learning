 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has
 mildly increased.  Also increased is the elongation of the descending aorta. 
 With respect to the lung parenchyma, there is hyperlucency at the level of the
 right and left upper lobe, likely reflecting apical pulmonary emphysema.  In
 addition, there are at least ___ mm nodular opacities in the right upper
 lobe that could reflect exposure to granulomatous disease, notably in the
 light of the positive PPD given in the clinical history.  Further clinical
 workup must be performed accordingly.
 
 No pleural effusions.  Interval increase in radiodensity an diameter of the
 right hilus, potentially caused by enlarged lymph nodes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT is strongly recommended to clarify the interval
 enlargement of the right hilus, as well as the left and right upper lobe
 changes described above.
