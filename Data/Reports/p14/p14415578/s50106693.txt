                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with febrile neutropenia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. FDG PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with an abnormal contour at the
 level of AP window and to the right lower paratracheal stripe reflective of
 known FDG avid mediastinal mass.  Aortic arch calcifications are re-
 demonstrated.  There is no new focal lung consolidation.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Abnormality of the cardiomediastinal contour is consistent with known
 mediastinal FDG avid mass, better evaluated on prior PET-CT from ___.
 2. No evidence of superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.  No focal lung
 consolidation.
