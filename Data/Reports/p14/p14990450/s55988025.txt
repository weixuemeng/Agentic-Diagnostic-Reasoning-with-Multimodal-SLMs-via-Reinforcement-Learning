 There is no large right pneumothorax but there may be a growing postsurgical
 pneumatocele at the lateral margin of the right midlung.  Right pleural
 effusion is small if any.
 
 Moderate Bibasilar atelectasis unchanged.  Greater caliber of the pulmonary
 and mediastinal vessels suggests increased intravascular volume but heart is
 not enlarged and there is no edema.  Severe subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right neck and chest wall has redistributed but is probably no larger.
