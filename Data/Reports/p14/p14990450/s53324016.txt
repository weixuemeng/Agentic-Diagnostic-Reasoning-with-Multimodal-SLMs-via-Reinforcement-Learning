                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with TBM s/p tracheobronchoplasty.  // eval
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 4x
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Multiple lines, leads and tubes overlie the chest. One may represent an
 epidural catheter.
 
 Again seen is a right chest tube, similar in configuration. Compared with the
 study from one day earlier, there has been progression of subcutaneous
 emphysema across the chest, which obscures fine detail. Extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema is also seen on both sides of the neck and over in the
 right-greater-than-left supraclavicular regions. Allowing for this, no obvious
 pneumothorax is detected. The defect in the right upper posterior rib is again
 noted, likely postsurgical.
 
 Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is more pronounced. No gross
 right effusion is identified. Some focal opacity in the right upper zone
 laterally is noted --  if real, this is new, but it could represent artifact
 due to the presence of the subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 On the left, there is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base in the
 retrocardiac region, with slight blunting of left costophrenic angle. Left
 lung is otherwise grossly clear. No findings suggestive of CHF on the left.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left chest tube again noted. Increased subcutaneous emphysema, but no
 obvious pneumothorax.
 2. Opacity in right upper zone laterally--___ artifact versus new focal
 opacity. Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 3. Small patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, more pronounced
 than the film from one day earlier.
