 eval for aspiration or PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are low relatively low lung volumes.  Substantial

 appeared to be bilateral calcified pleural plaques.  Given these extensive
 changes, it is impossible to exclude superimposed aspiration or pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
