                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVA 1 week prior now with continuing pleuritic chest
 pain.  Right foot fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no displaced rib fracture
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present.  The heart size and
 pulmonary vascularity are normal.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No displaced rib fracture.  If concern for rib fracture persists,
 a dedicated rib series with markers would be of utility.
