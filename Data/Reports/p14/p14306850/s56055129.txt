                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is patchy right basilar opacity which could be due to consolidation from
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Alternatively, findings could
 relate to atelectasis.  There may also be a trace right pleural effusion.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are stable and
 unremarkable.
