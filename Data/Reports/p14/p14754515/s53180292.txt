                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension  // eval for pulm edema / acute
 biliary pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at ___:___ from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the mid the low SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The proximal portion of the venous catheter appears
 possibly coiled upon itself, however, part of the catheter may be external to
 the patient, and may just be overlapping.  There are relatively low lung
 volumes.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, likely accentuated by
 AP, portable technique.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
