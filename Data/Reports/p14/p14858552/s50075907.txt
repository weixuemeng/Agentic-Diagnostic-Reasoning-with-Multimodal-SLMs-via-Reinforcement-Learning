 Minimal pleural effusions have newly occurred bilaterally. In addition, areas
 of basilar atelectasis are seen. At the bases of the left lung, better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph, is a subtle
 increase in radiodensity that could potentially reflect developing pneumonia.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
