  Limited by thoracic kyphosis.  Right upper extremity PICC and enteric tube
  satisfactory.  Cervical fusion hardware unchanged.  Opacities of the right
  lung base could represent atelectasis, although, pneumonia should be
  considered.  Old rib fractures noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New oxygen requirement, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in constant position.  The lung volumes have slightly decreased,
 leading to crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures, in particular at
 the right lung base.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Known
 bilateral old rib fractures.  The tip of the right PICC line projects more
 distally on today's examination, approximately at the level of the
 mid-to-lower SVC.
