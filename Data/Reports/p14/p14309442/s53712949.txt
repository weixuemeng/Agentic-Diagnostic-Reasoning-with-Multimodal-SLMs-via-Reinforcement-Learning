                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low sats.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Markedly rotating positioning.  
 
 There are posterior rods and screws overlying the cervical spine with
 overlying skin ___, not fully evaluated.  A Dobbhoff-type tube is present,
 with the radiopaque portion of the tube overlying the left mid abdomen, not
 clearly extending beyond the pylorus.  Increased density in the right
 paratracheal  thoracic inlet most likely represents the known vertebral fusion
 construct, distorted by patient obliquity.
 
 
 Allowing for markedly rotated positioning, no overt CHF, frank consolidation,
 or gross effusion is detected.  Possibility of some bibasilar atelectasis
 cannot be excluded.  An old healed fracture of a left posterior mid chest rib
 is noted. 
  
 Review of the ___ lateral views suggests deformity of the manubrium,
 raising the question of a fracture of indeterminate acuity.  Assessment of the
 thoracic spine is quite limited on these views -- prior films show a gibbous
 type focally accentuated kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Limited exam, but doubt overt CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion.
 Please note that subtle infiltrate might not be apparent on these views and
 that the mediastinum is poorly evaluated.  
 
 2) Fractures of the thoracic spine and manubrium not directly visualized on
 this exam, but suggested on correlative studies.
