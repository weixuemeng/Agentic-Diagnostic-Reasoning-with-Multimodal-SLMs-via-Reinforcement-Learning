 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits as are the mediastinal

 small amount of pleural fluid is seen tracking along the right lateral pleural
 space.  Clips in the gallbladder fossa represent prior cholecystectomy with
 couple of dropped clips sitting just at the dome of the liver.  A plastic CBD
 stent is also present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and small right pleural effusion.
