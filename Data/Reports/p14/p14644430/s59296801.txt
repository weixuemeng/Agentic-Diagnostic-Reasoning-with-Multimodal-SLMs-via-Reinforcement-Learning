                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lung volumes are slightly low which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings. Streaky bibasilar opacities are most
 consistent with atelectasis. No focal consolidation is identified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Of note, the patient's arm is down on the
 lateral view which somewhat limits evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation is identified to suggest
 pneumonia.
