 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 6:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with post-extubation, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 6:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval extubation.  Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip
 in the mid SVC.  Interval appearance of patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 region, likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a
 small effusion.  The patchy opacity at the right base is unchanged.  However,
 there is increasing perihilar fullness and suggestion ___ ___'s lines in the
 right lung.  These findings favor interval development of mild perihilar and
 interstitial edema.  Heart remains enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded and tortuous. 
 No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is
 diminished given supine technique.
