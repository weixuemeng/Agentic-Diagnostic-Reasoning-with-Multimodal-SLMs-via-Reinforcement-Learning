                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with removal of left acetabular hardware,
 now with question allergic reaction to antibiotics.  Evaluate for pneumonia,
 effusion, edema or atelectasis.
 
 A comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Markedly low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater
 than left, most likely reflecting atelectasis rather than an early pneumonia. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusions, or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in inspiration and technique between studies. 
 No acute bony abnormality.
