                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath for three days.  Reports a
 fever at home.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior exam, there is a new large opacity
 involving the left middle and lower lung zones, most consistent with
 pneumonia.  A component of pleural fluid is difficult to exclude.  There is
 mild streaky opacification at the right base with obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  This could be due to atelectasis, or a second focus of
 pneumonia.  
 
 The mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate given the adjacent opacity,
 though they appear increased in diameter since the prior exam.  This is may be
 due to technique and obscuration from the left hemithorax opacity.  The heart
 size is difficult to determine because of the adjacent opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New large left middle and lower lung zone opacity, most consistent with
 pneumonia.  A component of pleural fluid is difficult to completely exclude. 
 Recommend follow-up to resolution to exclude an underlyingmass.
 2.  Smaller opacity at the right base may represent atelectasis or second
 focus of pneumonia.  
 3.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum may be related to the AP technique
 and patient rotation.  Recommend a repeat PA and lateral radiograph when the
 patient is more clinically stable, if high clinical concern for acute
 mediastinal/aortic process, CT is more sensitive.
