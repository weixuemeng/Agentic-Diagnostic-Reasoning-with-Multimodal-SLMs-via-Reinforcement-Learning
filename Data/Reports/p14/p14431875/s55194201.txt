 bilateral multifocal opacities described on ___, with residual
 atelectasis of the lingula and some residual opacity in the left lung base,
 likely left lower lobe.  Mild eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is new,
 might be due to some post-inflammatory traction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild scoliosis is
 unchanged.
