                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post aortic valve replacement.  Assess for
 interval change of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Overall, aeration of the lung bases appears
 improved compared to recent prior examination.  There is still a residual
 moderate left pleural effusion and probable trace right pleural effusion. 
 Atelectasis is presumed on the left.  A rounded opacity within the right lung
 base likely represents focal atelectasis, though followup radiographs are
 recommended to confirm resolution.  There is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Evaluation of the
 cardiac silhouette is limited secondary to the bibasal opacities.  A
 prosthetic aortic valve is in expected position.  Median sternotomy wires
 appear intact.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration of the lung bases, though with persistent bilateral
 pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right.
 
 2.  Ill-defined right basilar opacity may reflect residual atelectasis, though
 followup radiographs are recommended as developing infection remains in the
 differential.
