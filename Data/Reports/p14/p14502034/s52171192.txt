                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 10:28 a.m.
 
 The heart size and mediastinal silhouettes appears to be grossly unchanged,
 although it is difficult to exactly assess in the presence of bilateral large
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are demonstrated, at least
 partially secondary due to effusion.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
