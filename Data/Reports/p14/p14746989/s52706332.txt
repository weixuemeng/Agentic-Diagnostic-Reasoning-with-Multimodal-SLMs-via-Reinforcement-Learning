                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with hypotension and altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is rotated to
 the right.  There is a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is
 prominence of the hila, right greater than left, most likely relating to
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, increased since the prior study.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable given the
 right pleural effusion.  Mitral annulus calcification is noted.
