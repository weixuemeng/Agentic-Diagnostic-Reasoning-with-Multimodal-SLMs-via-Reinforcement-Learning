                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Wires of a left chest wall pacer terminate over the right atrium
 and right ventricle, similar to prior.  The heart is normal size with stable
 cardiomediastinal contours.  The aortic knob calcification is similar to
 prior.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and elevation of the apparent
 right hemidiaphragm is compatible with a moderate-sized pleural effusion, not
 appreciably changed since the prior exam, allowing for difference in patient
 position.  Adjacent opacity is compatible with atelectasis, but underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Pulmonary vascular markings are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized right pleural effusion, similar to prior. 
 Adjacent opacity may represent atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
