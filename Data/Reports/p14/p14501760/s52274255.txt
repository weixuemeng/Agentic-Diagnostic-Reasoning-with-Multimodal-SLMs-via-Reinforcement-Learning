                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, its tip terminates in the gastric
 fundus. As compared to prior chest radiograph, there is a an area of
 hyperlucency at the right lung base which likely represents a pneumothorax. 
 The heart remains enlarged with tortuosity of the aorta.  There are bibasilar
 opacities which likely reflect a combination of pleural fluid and volume loss,
 not significantly changed from prior examination. Multiple rib fractures are
 noted on the right and there is an area of soft tissue swelling overlying the
 lateral chest wall on the right. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased lucency at right lung base likely represents a pneumothorax.
 
 2. ET tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina, withdrawal of at least 2 cm is
 recommeded for adequate positioning.
