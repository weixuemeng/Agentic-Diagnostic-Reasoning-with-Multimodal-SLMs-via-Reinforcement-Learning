                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is mild unfolding of the descending thoracic
 aorta with calcification along the arch.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Patchy
 opacities are streaky in association with mild-to-moderate relative elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm, suggesting minor associated atelectasis or perhaps
 scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are
 noted along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
