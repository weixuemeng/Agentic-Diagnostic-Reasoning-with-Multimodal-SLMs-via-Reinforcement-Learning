                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:57.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with strep pneumonia and complicated
 effusion, evaluate for interval change, continued reexpansion of the lung.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:43.
 
 AP semi-erect and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 8:57, are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left chest tube remains in place.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There
 continues to be left lateral pleural thickening as well as patchy opacity at
 the left base and some scattered linear opacities which likely reflect patchy
 and subsegmental atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 The right lung remains clear.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable, although difficult to assess as the left heart border is
 obscured by overlying airspace process.  No pulmonary edema.
