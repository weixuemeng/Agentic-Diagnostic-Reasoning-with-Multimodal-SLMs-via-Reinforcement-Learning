                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chronic cough and sense of congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 The only abnormality I see in the lungs is a 9-mm opacity projecting over the
 anterior aspect of the right second and posterior fifth ribs which could be
 superimposition of normal structures, including minimal calcification of
 anterior rib end.  Because the patient has symptoms, it could also be
 inflammatory.  Therefore, I would recommend a repeat frontal radiograph in
 three to four weeks, to be shown to the radiologist before the patient leaves
 the department to determine if additional images are necessary.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces are normal.
