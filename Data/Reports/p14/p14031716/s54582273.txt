 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Increased density overlying the
 spine on the lateral view is more likely due to atelectasis and elevation of
 the hemidiaphragm compared to prior.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
