                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung volumes
 limits evaluation.  Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged though stable. 
 Aorta is somewhat unfolded.  Bony structures appear intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Otherwise, unremarkable study. 
 Specifically, no evidence of pneumonia.
