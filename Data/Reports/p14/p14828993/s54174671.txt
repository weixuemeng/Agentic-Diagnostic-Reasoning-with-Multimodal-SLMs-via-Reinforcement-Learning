                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes and underpenetrated technique.  The
 heart appears mildly enlarged with an LV configuration.  The apparent
 ground-glass opacity within the lungs could in part reflect inspiratory
 effort, though the possibility of mild edema is not excluded.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to low lung volumes and underpenetrated
 technique with mild cardiomegaly and possible mild pulmonary edema.
