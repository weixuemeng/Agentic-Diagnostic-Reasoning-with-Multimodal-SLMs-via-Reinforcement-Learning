                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope episode.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are low lung
 volumes, accentuating bronchovascular markings.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm persists.  There is minimal left base, linear atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There may be minimal vascular
 congestion, but this most likely relates to low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal lateral left base, linear atelectasis.  Otherwise no significant
 interval change since the prior study, including low lung volumes which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings; possible minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion, however, likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
