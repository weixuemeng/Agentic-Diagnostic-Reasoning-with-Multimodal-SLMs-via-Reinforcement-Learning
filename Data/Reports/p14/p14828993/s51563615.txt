                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Found on ground.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, there
 are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion/edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette top normal.
