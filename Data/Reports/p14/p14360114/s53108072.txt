                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS, facial weakness  // evaluate for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are quite
 low limiting assessment.  Vague opacities throughout both lungs may represent
 areas of scattered atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude an atypical pneumonia. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette likely normal
 allowing for suboptimal technique.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague scattered lung opacities likely atelectasis, difficult to exclude an
 atypical pneumonia.  Recommend repeat with more optimal inspiratory effort to
 better assess if there is further clinical concern.
