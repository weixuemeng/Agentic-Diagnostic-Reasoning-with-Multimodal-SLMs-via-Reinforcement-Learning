 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with mvr  // check L ptx      check L ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a left chest tube.  There has been improved expansion of the left hemithorax,
 though it is difficult to unequivocally exclude a small pneumothorax due to
 overlying bony structures an external devices in the region.  The endotracheal
 tube has been repositioned so that the tip lies approximately 2 cm above the
 carina.
 Lower lung volumes, but otherwise little change.
