 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PICC placement  // verify PICC placement
 for home infusion company      verify PICC placement for home infusion company
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the PICC line
 lies within the right atrium.  It could be pulled back approximately 2 cm to
 definitely be at or above the cavoatrial junction.  Prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette is again seen.  The pulmonary vessels are more engorged and
 indistinct, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Basilar opacifications probably reflect small pleural effusion underlying
 atelectatic changes.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be
 considered, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
