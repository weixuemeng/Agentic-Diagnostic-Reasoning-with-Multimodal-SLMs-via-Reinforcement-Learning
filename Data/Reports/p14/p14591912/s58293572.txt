                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo F with complicated PMHx presenting to the hospital several
 days ago with symptoms of abdominal pain, recent UTI, and treatment for
 pyelonephritis with clinical decompensation and found to have c.diff and CT
 abdomen concerning for toxic megacolon s/p total colectomy, end ileostomy off
 of pressors and extubated w/ desaturations intermittently in setting of recent
 emesis  // intrapulmonary process  intrapulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  The hazy opacification at the right base has
 decreased, but is still consistent with pleural fluid and underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  Is unclear whether the a apparent improvement could
 merely represent a more upright position of the patient.  At the left base,
 the hemidiaphragm is again obscured consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion.  Indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels, is consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
