                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cervical mass, concern for cancer  //
 assess for lung nodules.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior exams available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 There is a circular opacity projecting over the left lower lung which is well
 circumscribed and most likely represents left nipple, less likely left lower
 lung true parenchymal lesion. There is no definitive lower lung lesion seen on
 lateral view. Given clinical indication for chest x-ray, it is recommended to
 obtain repeat PA x-ray with bilateral shallow oblique views and nipple
 markers.
 
 There are no other focal lung consolidations. There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Well-circumscribed circular opacity projecting over left lower lung, most
 likely represents left nipple, less likely a true left lower lung nodule. 
 Recommend repeat PA with bilateral oblique views and nipple markers. Otherwise
 unremarkable chest x-ray.
