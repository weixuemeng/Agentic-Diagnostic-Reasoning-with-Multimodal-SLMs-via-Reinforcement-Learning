                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with crackles bilaterally, edema  // ? CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggest obstructive disease.  Coarseness of lung markings
 could reflect either chronic lung disease, vascular congestion or both.  There
 is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Note is made of
 calcification of the mitral valve annulus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Hyperinflated lungs are consistent with obstructive disease.
 3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
