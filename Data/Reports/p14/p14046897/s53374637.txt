                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall with multiple bruises, question rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs are
 clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  There is a subtle deformity of the right posterolateral eighth rib,
 which is unchanged from prior exam.  No acute displaced rib fractures are
 identified.  Right AC joint arthropathy is again noted.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  No definite compression fractures are seen within the
 imaged spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No injury seen.  If strong clinical concern for rib fracture,
 consider dedicated rib series.
