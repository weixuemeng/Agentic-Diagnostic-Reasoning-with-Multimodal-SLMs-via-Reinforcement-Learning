  1. Increased left base and retrocardiac opacities could reflect pneumonia in
  the appropriate clinical setting. Short interval imaging follow up is
  recommended after treatment to document resolution.
  
  2. 16 mm rounded opacity at the right lung base, for which further evaluation
  is recommended with a non urgent chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, heavy smoker.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Lungs are hyperexpanded. Increased left base and retrocardia opacities could
 represent an early infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting.
 There is 16 mm rounded opacity at the right lung base, for which further
 evaluation is recommended with a non urgent chest CT. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
