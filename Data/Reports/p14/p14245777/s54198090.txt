                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L thoracotomy, L upper segmentectomy
 complicated by PA injury  // interval change, please evaluate
 
 COMPARISON:  Change sixth ___ at 07:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been slight improvement in CHF findings.
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is a left subclavian central line with tip over distal most SVC. 
 There is cardiomegaly, possibly slightly improved.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unchanged.   There is upper zone redistribution, but
 without other evidence of CHF. Minimal patchy opacity at the right base is
 improved. Minimal linear atelectasis the left lung base is also seen.  Left
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated.   Pleural thickening along the left chest wall
 is again noted.  Probable azygos lobe in the right upper zone.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in CHF findings.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.
