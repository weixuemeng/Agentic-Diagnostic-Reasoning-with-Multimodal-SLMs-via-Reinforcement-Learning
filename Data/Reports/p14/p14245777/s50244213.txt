                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  70G w/ lepitic type adenoca in LUL, no evidence of
 lymphadenopathy or metastases s/p robotic-assisted converted to L thoracotomy,
 L upper segmentectomy c/b L PA injury  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left apical chest tube remains in place.  A left subclavian central venous
 catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax.  Left-sided volume loss with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 is stable.  The mediastinal contour appears slightly wider today.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is
 unchanged.  The lungs are grossly clear.  No radiopaque foreign body is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased mediastinal widening may be due to a combination of in cord
 mediastinal vessels and atelectasis, but a contrast-enhanced chest CT may be
 obtained to exclude a mediastinal hematoma.
