                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper quadrant and left lower lung pain.  Status post
 splenectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Faintly visualized nodular focus in the
 left mid lung, probably within the lingula, measuring about 5 mm in diameter
 may correspond to a known nodule on a remote prior CT from ___. 
 There is potentially a second nodule versus confluence of bronchovascular
 shadows projecting more inferiorly in the left lower lung.  Otherwise, the
 lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute process.  One or perhaps two nodular foci,
 small in size, within the left mid-to-lower lung, not specific and possibly
 correlating with previously seen lung nodules.  It is difficult to confirm
 whether these may be different and accordingly new nodules than seen
 previously, however.  
 
 Consideration of chest CT is suggested, particularly if symptoms were to
 persist, and radiographic surveillance may otherwise be appropriate within
 three months.
