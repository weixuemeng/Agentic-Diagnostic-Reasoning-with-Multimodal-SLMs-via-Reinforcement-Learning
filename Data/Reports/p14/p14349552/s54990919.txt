                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 Bilateral perihilar regions appear less well aerated with slightly increased
 opacification.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: Possible perihilar pneumonia.  Oblique views may be obtained for
 confirmation now, otherwise we suggest a repeat study in 24 hours if patient
 does not declare clinically.
