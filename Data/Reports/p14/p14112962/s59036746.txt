                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation.  Heart size appears mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted diffusely in the aorta.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema with bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis.  Small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions are noted,
 larger on the right.  No large pneumothorax is identified.  No displaced
 fractures are seen.  Marked degenerative changes are noted involving both
 glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination due to patient rotation.  Mild pulmonary edema with
 bilateral small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect compressive atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
