 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A persistent lucency is identified adjacent to the left cardiac and
 mediastinal contour extending to the level of the aortic knob.  This may
 reflect pneumopericardium or an anteromedial pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged.  Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Persistent
 bilateral retrocardiac atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
