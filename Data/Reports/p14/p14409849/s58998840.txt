                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post tissue aortic valve
 replacement and bypass surgery, followup left apical pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding study of ___.  The heart contours remain enlarged and
 similar.  There is again evidence of some mediastinal air along the left
 lateral cardiac contours.  There is no evidence of remaining pneumothorax in
 the apical area.  The loculated hydropneumothorax along the anterior chest
 wall as identified on the lateral view remains unaltered.  No new pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities are identified and the accessible pulmonary
 vasculature is not more congested than before.Left-sided basal pulmonary
 pleural densities suggestive of post-operative atelectasis remain unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Loculated post-operative hydropneumothorax along anterior chest
 wall.  No significant interval change during latest day.
