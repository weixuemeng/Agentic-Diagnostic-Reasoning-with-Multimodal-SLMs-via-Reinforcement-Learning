                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 Status post median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery with similar
 postoperative appearance of enlarged cardiac silhouette which may reflect
 pericardial effusion given increase from baseline preoperative chest
 radiograph.  Curvilinear lucency persists adjacent to the left mediastinal and
 cardiac contours could reflect persistent pneumopericardium as demonstrated on
 the initial postoperative radiograph or a small anteromedial left
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased.
