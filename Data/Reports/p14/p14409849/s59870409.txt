                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient  is status post recent median sternotomy and
 cardiovascular surgery.  Various indwelling support and monitoring devices
 have been removed, with no visible pneumothorax.  Pneumopericardium is again
 visualized, however.  Worsening atelectasis is present in both retrocardiac
 regions, and there remains evidence of a small left pleural effusion. 
 Postoperative widening of cardiac silhouette is stable since the previous
 study and probably represents a combination of baseline cardiomegaly and
 pericardial effusion.
