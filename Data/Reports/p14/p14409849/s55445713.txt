                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR and CABG.  Evaluate for subcutaneous gas or left
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains significantly enlarged compared to pre-op
 radiograph suggesting a pericardial effusion.  Persistent curvilinear lucency
 around the left heart border suggests pneumomediastinum.  A region of
 subcutaneous emphysema in the left supraclavicular soft tissue and a small,
 loculated retrosternal hydropneumothorax (likely left sided) are not clearly
 identified on the prior exam.  Bibasilar (left greater than right atelectasis)
 and bilateral effusions have improved compared to prior study.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned at the time of dictation for relay of
 results.
