                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right chest wall resection and right
 pneumonectomy for rhabdomyosarcoma.  Chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 Comparison none.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Postoperative changes of right
 pneumonectomy are seen with air-fluid level in the midlung.  There is no prior
 available for comparison to evaluate for expected superior migration of this
 air-fluid level.  Postthoracotomy changes are identified on the right.  Right
 chest wall port is seen with tip in the upper SVC.  Stent projects over the
 expected region of the mid and lower SVC.  The left lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given opacity at the right
 lung base however is grossly unremarkable.
