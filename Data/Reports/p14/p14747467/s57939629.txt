 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HA, abd pain and vomiting  // ICH, ?
 appendicitis, colitis      ICH, ? appendicitis, colitis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms, consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Given the hyperexpansion, there is enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  However, no evidence of
 acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 On the lateral view, there again are metallic densities posteriorly in the
 right soft tissues, possibly related to previous gunshot fragments.  However,
 on the frontal view, the abdomen is not visualized so the fat pathology in
 this region cannot be assessed.
