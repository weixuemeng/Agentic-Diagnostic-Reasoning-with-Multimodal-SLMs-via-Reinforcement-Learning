                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male presenting with ventricular tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increased opacity within the
 right upper to mid lung laterally, new from prior examination.  Findings may
 reflect developing infection but are non-specific.  The remainder of the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no overt interstitial edema.  No large pleural
 effusions are evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  An AICD generator and single
 lead appear in expected unchanged position terminating in the region of the
 right ventricle.  Numerous mediastinal clips from prior CABG are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New peripheral opacities in the right mid to upper lung may
 reflect developing infection.  Recommend PA and lateral chest radiograph when
 patient is able for further assessment.
