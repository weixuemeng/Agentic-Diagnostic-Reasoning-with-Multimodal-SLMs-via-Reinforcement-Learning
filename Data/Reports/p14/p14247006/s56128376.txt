 ventricle and the left epicardial vein.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable
 in the patient who is after median sternotomy and CABG.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  There is interval development of new opacity projecting just above the
 minor fissure that potentially might reflect a focus of developing infection. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.

 Suspected right upper lobe developing infectious process, otherwise stable
 appearance of the radiograph.
