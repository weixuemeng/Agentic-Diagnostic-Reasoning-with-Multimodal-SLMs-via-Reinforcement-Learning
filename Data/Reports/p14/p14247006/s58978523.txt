                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and chills, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased from the most
 recent prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  Increased opacification at the lateral left lung on
 the frontal view, without definite correlate on the corresponding lateral view
 may represent underpenetration of soft tissues.  There is mild atelectasis of
 the left lower lobe.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Multiple mediastinal
 surgical clips are compatible with prior CABG.  A left pectoral pacemaker is
 unchanged with three leads in stable position.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly decreased lung volumes with increased opacification at
 the left lung base, most likely representing atelectasis.
