                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CHF exacerbation, getting diuresed.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Small left effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar increased opacities greater on the left
 side are the combination of atelectasis, effusions, and the pulmonary edema. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.
