                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R pleural effusion, suspected alcoholic
 hepatitis  // evaluate for presence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is a moderate to moderately large right pleural effusion.  There is
 likely underlying collapse and/or consolidation, although the level of the
 diaphragm is obscured.  A small amount of fluid is again seen extending into
 the minor fissure.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains midline.  The left lung and the upper right lung remain grossly clear.
 No CHF or left-sided effusion.
 
 A small, somewhat rounded density is noted along the lower edge of the left
 anterior fourth rib adjacent to the chest wall, not fully characterized --?
 question due to something outside the patient.
 
 Minimal wedging of the presumptive T10 and ___ vertebral bodies, slight
 accentuation of kyphosis at T10-___ is again noted, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to moderately large right base effusion, unchanged , with underlying
 right base collapse and/or consolidation.  The right hemidiaphragm itself is
 obscured.
 
 Heart size at the upper limits of normal.
 
 No CHF, left effusion, or other focal opacity.  The left lung remains well
 expanded.
 
 Small (approximately 8.6 mm),  rounded density adjacent to the left chest wall
 in the mid zone --  question something outside the patient.  Attention to this
 area on followup films is requested.  If clinically indicated, oblique views
 of the chest may help for further characterization.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Oblique views of the chest may help for further
 characterization of the small rounded opacity adjacent to the mid left chest
 wall.  Please see comment above.
