                                 FINAL REPORT
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.  Again
 there is a persistent mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy as well as
 an infiltrative mass with associated collapse of the right mid and lower lobes
 and moderate right pleural effusion.  Pulmonary nodules are again seen, though
 better appreciated on the previous CT scan.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
