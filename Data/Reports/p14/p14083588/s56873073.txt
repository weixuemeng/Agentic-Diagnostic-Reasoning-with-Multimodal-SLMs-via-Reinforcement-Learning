                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison with prior exams dated ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided, which again
 demonstrate opacification of the right mid-to-lower lung, compatible with
 known lung mass and associated right effusion.  There are small nodular
 opacities within the left lung which are compatible with pulmonary metastasis.
 The heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour remains prominent,
 compatible with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  No significant interval
 change is seen.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of the chest with right mid-lower lung
 opacity compatible with known malignant tumor with associated mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy and small left pulmonary nodular metastases.
