                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, s/p thoracentesis  // Eval for
 interval resolution of R pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Right basilar opacity again seen, concerning for pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis, appears somewhat decreased as compared to the prior
 study, but still significant. A larger component of the opacity may now
 represent atelectasis and known underlying pulmonary malignancy, however,
 there is persistent shift of the mediastinum to the left.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen. Pulmonary nodules seen on prior chest CT from ___ are better appreciated on that study. No new focal consolidation is seen
 in the left lung. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___ at 16:23
