                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs with history of right
 pleural effusion and new dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the most recent CT exam, there has been interval development of a
 moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with associated right basilar
 atelectasis.  Rounded opacity within the right lung base likely reflects a
 metastatic lesion.  Other known pulmonary nodules within the lungs are not
 well seen on the current exam.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Assessment of the cardiac
 silhouette size is difficult given the presence of the right pleural effusion.
 Fullness of the right mediastinal contour is compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy, and appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior CT
 exam.  No acute osseous lesion is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis. 
 Rounded opacity within the right lung base likely reflects a metastatic
 lesion.  Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
