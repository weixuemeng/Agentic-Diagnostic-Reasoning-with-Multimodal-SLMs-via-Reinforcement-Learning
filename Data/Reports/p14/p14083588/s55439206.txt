                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RUL stricture s/p bronch  // interval
 imaging
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support and monitoring devices are stable in position except for new upward
 turned of the nasogastric tube within the fundus.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable allowing for patient rotation. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema. Atelectasis of right
 middle and right lower lobes is again demonstrated accompanied by pleural
 effusion. Worsening opacity at left lung base probably reflects a combination
 of increasing small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis and or
 consolidation at the left base.
