                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleural effusion, dyspnea // Eval for
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacity is similar
 in comparison to the prior study, allowing for differences in imaging
 acquisition technique and patient positioning. The heart size is stable. No
 pneumothorax is seen. There is no pulmonary edema. The left lung is grossly
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in appearance of large right pleural effusion
 and right basilar opacity, compatible with known metastatic disease.
