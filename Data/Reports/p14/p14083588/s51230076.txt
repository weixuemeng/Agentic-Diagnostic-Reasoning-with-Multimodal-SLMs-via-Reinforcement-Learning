                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath. History of RCC.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an interval increase in right-sided
 moderate-to-large pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. 
 Redemonstrated is complete collapse of the right middle and right lower lobes.
 Widespread metastatic nodules are better assessed on the recent CT performed
 on the same day.  There has been an interval increase in bilateral perihilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in the aeration of the right lung secondary to worsening
 atelectasis and right pleural effusion.  A superimposed infectious process
 cannot be excluded.
 2.  Widespread metastatic disease is better evaluated on the CT performed on
 the same day.
