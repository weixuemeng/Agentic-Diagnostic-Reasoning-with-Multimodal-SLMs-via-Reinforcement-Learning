 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following thoracentesis, a right pleural effusion has slightly
 decreased in size with residual moderate effusion remaining.  Unusual rounded
 contour at the superior aspect of the effusion may relate to unusual
 orientation of right middle and right lower lobe collapse based on
 corresponding CT of ___, likely with associated tumor
 infiltration within the collapsed lobe.  Widespread mediastinal and right
 hilar lymphadenopathy are similar, as well as small lung nodules, have been
 more fully evaluated by CT as well.
