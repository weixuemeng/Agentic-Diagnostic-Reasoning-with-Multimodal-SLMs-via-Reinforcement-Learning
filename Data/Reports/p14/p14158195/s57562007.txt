                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain status post CABG, question enlarged
 cardiac silhouette.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Prominent interstitial markings are seen in the
 lungs bilaterally without confluent consolidation or effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal, stable. 
 Multiple coronary artery stents are identified, best seen on the lateral view.
 Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.  The osseous
 structures and soft tissues are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent interstitial markings in the lungs bilaterally which
 can be due to mild interstitial edema versus chronic underlying lung disease. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change from prior.
