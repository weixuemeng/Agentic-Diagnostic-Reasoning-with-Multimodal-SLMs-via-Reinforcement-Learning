                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is significant opacification of the right hemi thorax, with some
 residual aerated right upper lobe, better seen on chest CT to be a combination
 of neoplasm, inflammatory consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion.
 The left lung is clear. There is no left-sided effusion. No pneumothorax is
 identified. The left cardiac margin is preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification of the right hemi thorax with some aerated right upper lobe is
 likely a combination of neoplasm, infiltrative process and pleural effusion,
 and is better seen in concurrent chest CT.
