                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with confusion, liver failure, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval development of bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe
 consolidation which could reflect atelectasis.  Heart size cannot be assessed.
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures appear intact.  No
 definite sign of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions with
 lower lobe compressive atelectasis.  Cannot exclude underlying pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution.
