                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 737 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post pleurodesis, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 737 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar chest tube remains in place.  There is right lateral pleural
 thickening and blunting of the right costophrenic angle which likely reflects
 pleural fluid and thickening.  A more elliptical opacity in the right mid to
 lower lung is also stable and may represent loculated fluid within the fissure
 or partial middle lobe collapse.  Overall, there has been no significant
 interval change in appearance of the right lung.  Left lung continues to
 demonstrate some patchy retrocardiac opacity which could reflect partial lower
 lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
