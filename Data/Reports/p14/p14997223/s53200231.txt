 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle along with right
 lateral pleural thickening, findings similar to the prior exam. This maybe
 related to the patient's previous loculated pleural effusion and pleurodesis.
 There is no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from prior with no acute cardiopulmonary
 process. Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle and right lateral
 pleural thickening, likely related to the patient's history of pleurodesis and
 pleural effusion.
