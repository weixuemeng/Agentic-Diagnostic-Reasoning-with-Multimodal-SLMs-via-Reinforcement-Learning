                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate effusion in patient with end-stage liver disease and
 chronic pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is a moderate right-sided
 pleural effusion with basilar compressive atelectasis, which obscures the
 right hemidiaphragm and layers posteriorly.  There does not appear to be a
 left-sided pleural effusion, although assessment is incomplete without lateral
 image.  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  A Dobbhoff
 feeding tube can be seen traversing the esophagus and entering the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion, stable to possibly mildly
 increased, given differences in patient position.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, stable, without evidence of pulmonary edema.
