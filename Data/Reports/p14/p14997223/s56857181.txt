                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 12:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with OLT, effusions, status post
 pleurodesis, chest tube removal, check for any interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 8:32.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 12:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar chest tube remains in place.  There continue to be bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated airspace disease
 which is concerning for atelectasis or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  In addition, a more focal elliptical opacity in the right mid lung
 either represents loculated fluid within the minor fissure or could be related
 to partial middle lobe collapse.  Overall, when compared to the most recent
 study, ther is likely no significant interval change.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
