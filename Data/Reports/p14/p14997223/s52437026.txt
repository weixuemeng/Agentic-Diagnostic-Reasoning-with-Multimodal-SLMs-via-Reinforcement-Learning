                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the opacification involving the
 right hemithorax has essentially cleared with minimal residual blunting of the
 costophrenic angle and fibrotic streaks in the mid and lower zones.  The left
 lung is essentially clear and the cardiac silhouette is unchanged given the
 different position of the patient.
