 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post removal of the Dobbhoff with new Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a new Dobbhoff has been
 placed.  The course of the new tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the
 middle parts of the stomach.
 
 No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The pleural effusions,
 low lung volumes and areas of atelectasis as well as the extent of the
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
