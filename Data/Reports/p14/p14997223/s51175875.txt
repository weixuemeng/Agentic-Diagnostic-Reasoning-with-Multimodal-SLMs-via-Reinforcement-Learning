                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male transferred with apparent right lower
 lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right basilar
 opacity previously noted to represent pleural effusion and atelectasis with
 the right hemidiaphragm remaining elevated.  A lateral view would be helpful
 for further evaluation.  The left lung is clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity previously seen to represent right pleural
 effusion and atelectasis has decreased as compared to the prior study; a
 lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation.
