                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent pleural biopsy, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study dated ___.  The present AP single view obtained with
 patient in semi-upright position demonstrates increasing basal density with
 increased blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses.  Previously described
 pleural density along the entire right chest wall remains unchanged and the
 same holds for the previously described two right basal draining pleural
 tubes.  Observed is that also the left pleural sinus shows now some fluid
 blunting its contours.
 
 No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of increasing pulmonary congestion with increasing
 pleural effusions.
