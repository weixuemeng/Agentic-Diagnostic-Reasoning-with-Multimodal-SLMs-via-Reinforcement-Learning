                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath, minimal lung sounds on right
 lung field to mid way.  Assess effusion and atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This patient had a recent liver transplant.
 
 There is a new large round right lower lobe convexity : the diaphragm contour
 is difficult to see.  There is certainly some pleural effusion, but that does
 not explain all of it and the sonogram done yesterday showed only
 mild-to-moderate pleural effusion.  The left lung is unremarkable.  Mild
 cardiac enlargement is stable.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient with recent liver transplant.  New large round density in right lower
 lobe . Small amount of pleural effusion seen on abdominal US most likely
 correspond to just part of it.  Diaphragmatic eventration or
 infradiaphragmatic process has to be excluded.  Further assessment with CT
 scan is suggested.
 
 Dr. ___ has been verbally contacted for the results at 4:15 p.m. 
 Time of the exam 3:27 p.m.
