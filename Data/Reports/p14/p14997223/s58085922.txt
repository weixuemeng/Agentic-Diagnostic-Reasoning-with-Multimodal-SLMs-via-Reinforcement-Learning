                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath but stable O2 sats, ?
 effusion versus opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained. Heart is moderately
 enlarged. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The opacity seen in the
 right lower lobe is stable. Right hemidiaphragm is not readily visilble and
 the opacity extends to the edge of the right major fissure on the lateral
 view, reflecting collapse of the lower lobe with possible sparing of the
 superior segment. The minor fisure is not readily itenfied raising the
 possibility of right middle lobe collapse as well. Mild left pleural effusion.
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable RLL and possibly RML collapse.
