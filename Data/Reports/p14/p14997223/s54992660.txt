                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post Pleurx insertion with tachypnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two chest tubes remain in good position.  Increased opacification
 of the right lung likely due to either redistribution of right pleural
 effusion or slight worsening of the pleural effusion.  Left pleural effusion
 is stable.  The left basilar atelectasis is slightly improved, and the right
 basilar atelectasis is stable.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable or possibly slightly increased right pleural effusion.
 2.  Improved left basilar atelectasis.
