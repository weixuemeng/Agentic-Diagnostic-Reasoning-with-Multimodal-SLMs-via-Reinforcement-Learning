                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of end-stage liver
 disease, positive blood cultures, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, most consistent with bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Additional right base opacity is seen which could relate
 to effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is of concern. 
 No focal consolidation is seen in the left lung.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
