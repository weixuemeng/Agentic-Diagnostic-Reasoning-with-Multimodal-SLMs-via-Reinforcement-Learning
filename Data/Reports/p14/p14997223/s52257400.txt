                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, GI bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Since the prior study, there has
 been interval increase in size of the right pleural effusion which is now
 large, with associated atelectasis of the right lung.  Ill-defined
 retrocardiac opacity persists, and may reflect atelectasis, though infection
 is not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Evaluation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due to the presence of the large
 effusion.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Previously noted gastric
 tube has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion, increased in size from the prior
 study, with associated compressive atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity is
 unchanged, and may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
