                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP semi-erect upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A feeding
 tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm on the left, inferior
 aspect not seen.  The patient is rotated slightly to the left.  There is a
 large area of right-sided opacification likely representing combination of
 large right pleural effusion with possible overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  There is likely a small left pleural effusion. 
 No new evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 accurately assess due to the large right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large right pleural effusion with likely some degree of underlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  Likely small left pleural
 effusion.
 
 2.  Feeding tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, although
 inferior aspect not visualized.
