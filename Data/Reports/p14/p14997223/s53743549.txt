                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis
 complicated with varices, ascites, jaundice, and recent hyponatremia listed
 for liver transplant.  Presents from nursing facility with shortness of breath
 where he developed pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Marked elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm is noted,
 coinciding with blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinus indicative
 of pleural effusion.  The cardiac contours are correspondingly obliterated on
 the right side and heart size cannot be assessed with certainty.  However, the
 left-sided cardiac contours and that of the thoracic aorta are rather
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature in the left hemithorax and the
 accessible areas on the right side do not show pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Also, the left lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid
 accumulation.  An NG tube can be identified to pass far below the diaphragm
 and appears unchanged in comparison with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.
 
 Comparison of the latest portable examination with the present examination
 demonstrates that there exists free fluid in the right pleural space as the
 thickness of the pleural density changes with patient position.  The
 corresponding diffuse densities on the right lung base, most likely represent
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unilateral right-sided pleural effusion in patient with ascites. 
 No conclusive evidence for cardiac enlargement or pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but right-sided basal atelectasis is present in this patient with
 clinical history of cirrhosis of the liver.
