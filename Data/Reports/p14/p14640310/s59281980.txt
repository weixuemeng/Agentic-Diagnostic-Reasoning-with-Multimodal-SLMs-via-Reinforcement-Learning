                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left upper lobe/suprahilar streaky opacity is seen which may be due to
 underlying consolidation.  Overall, there is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There may also be patchy left base retrocardiac opacity.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left suprahilar opacity and possible patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity raises concern for underlying consolidations which may be due to
 infection and/or aspiration.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Dedicated
 PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
