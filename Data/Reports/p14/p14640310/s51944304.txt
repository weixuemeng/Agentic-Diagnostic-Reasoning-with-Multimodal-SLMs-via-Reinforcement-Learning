                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of chest radiation, two days of cough, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-described left
 upper lobe opacity is smaller and less severe.  On the lateral image, this
 opacity is not visible.  Although the change could reflect pneumonia, the
 short-term change makes atelectasis more likely.  Nevertheless, further
 followup is recommenced.
 
 No other relevant changes.  Moderate scoliosis with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta and mild asymmetry of the rib cage.  No pleural effusions.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
