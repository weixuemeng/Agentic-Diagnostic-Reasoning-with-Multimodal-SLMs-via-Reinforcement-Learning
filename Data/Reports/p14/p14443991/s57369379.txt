                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  History: ___M with respiratory distress status post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:22

 Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 2.6 cm from the
 carina. An enteric tube is noted with tip likely in the proximal duodenum.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema appears
 slightly worse in the interval.  Layering pleural effusions are again noted
 with bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis or aspiration. No
 large pneumothorax is present.
