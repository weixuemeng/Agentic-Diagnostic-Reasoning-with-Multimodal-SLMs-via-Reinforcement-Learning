                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Pulmonary
 vasculature does not appear engorged. Hazy opacities in both lungs likely
 reflects small layering pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect atelectasis or aspiration. No pneumothorax is identified.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is present. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small layering bilateral pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema and
 bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis or aspiration.
