                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated male, status post transfer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube traceable to
 the inferior margin of the clavicles, likely satisfactory in location.  An
 enteric tube extends inferiorly with tip in the stomach and side port above
 the GE junction.  Recommend further advancement by 5-8 cm to achieve
 intragastric location.  Allowing for low lung volume and AP technique, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The lungs are
 relatively clear, without pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild vascular
 congestion may be present, likely related to resuscitation.  Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enteric tube with side port above the GE junction.  Recommend 5-8 cm of
 advancement to achieve intragastric location.
 2.  ET tube, likely satisfactory in location on this limited view.
 3.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
