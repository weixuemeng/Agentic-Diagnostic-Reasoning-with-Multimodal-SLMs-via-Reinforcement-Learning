                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with IPH.  Evaluate position of orogastric

 endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic knob appropriately sited. 
 There is some coarsening of bronchovascular markings without overt pulmonary
 edema, focal consolidation or pleural effusions.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
