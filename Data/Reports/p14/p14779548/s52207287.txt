                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, shortness of breath  // eval for
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  Enlargement of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear
 slightly more prominent as compared to the prior study from ___ years prior,
 likely exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  If there is clinical
 concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CT is more sensitive.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Low lung volumes AP technique likely
 accentuates the enlargement of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes,
 although they appear slightly more prominent compared to the prior study from
 ___ years prior.  If there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal process,
 chest CT is more sensitive.
