                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, 11:45 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural and pericardial effusion and new lung
 nodules.  Evaluate PICC placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New opacification has recurred at both lung bases, previously cleared on the
 right after thoracentesis.  Findings could be due to dependent edema, since
 the heart is severely enlarged, but the pulmonary vasculature is not
 particularly engorged.  I would recommend careful followup for possible
 pneumonia.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the right atrium, approximately 8.5 cm below the level
 of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 4.5 cm to position it low in the
 SVC.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 2:45 p.m.
