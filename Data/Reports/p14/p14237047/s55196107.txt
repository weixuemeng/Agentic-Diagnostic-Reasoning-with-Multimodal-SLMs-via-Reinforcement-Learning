 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ through ___.  Bibasilar consolidation, either pneumonia or
 atelectasis and moderate bilateral pleural effusion right greater than left,
 all unchanged since ___.
 
 It is very difficult to distinguish colonic interposition in the right upper
 abdominal quadrant from multi loculated pneumo peritoneum.  That determination
 is more reliably made with dedicated abdominal imaging.  The right pleural
 effusion however is the most likely reflective of the abdominal contents,
 whether ascites, infection, or bile leak.
