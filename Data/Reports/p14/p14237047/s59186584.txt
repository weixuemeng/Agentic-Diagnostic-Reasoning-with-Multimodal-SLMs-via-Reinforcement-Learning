                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, ? PNA  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a prior CT
 of the abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Free air persists below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  There is a small residual right pleural effusion with
 mild right basal opacity likely representing atelectasis.  There is no
 convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  A calcific density projecting over the mediastinum likely
 represents a calcified lymph node.  Calcified granulomas project over the left
 upper lung.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Free air below the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior CT abdomen
 pelvis.
 2. Small right pleural effusion with right basal atelectasis.
