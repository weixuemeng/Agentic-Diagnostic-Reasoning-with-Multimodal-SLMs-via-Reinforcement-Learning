                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with leukocytosis, fall  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the right pleural drainage catheter.  No
 pneumothorax or gross pleural effusion detected.
 
 There is linear atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes.  There is
 increased retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects atelectasis though
 superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude. Cardiomediastinal
 contours, including left ventricular configuration and calcified unfolded
 aorta, are unchanged.  No CHF.
 
 Probable left upper zone calcified granulomas and calcified hilar or
 mediastinal lymph nodes, suggesting prior granulomatous infection.  Subtle
 noncalcified nodes a be present, better seen on ___.
 
 Mesh metallic density seen overlying the upper abdomen in the midline
 extending beyond the edge of this film is compatible with a stent of some
 kind.  The appearance is similar to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right-sided catheter.  No pneumothorax or gross effusion
 identified.
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis, though superimposed
 infection is difficult to completely exclude.
 
 Nodular densities in left upper lobe, some of which are calcified.  These were
 better seen on the ___ chest CT.  In the absence of supervening
 symptoms, consider follow-up CT in ___ months to assess for
 resolution/stability.
