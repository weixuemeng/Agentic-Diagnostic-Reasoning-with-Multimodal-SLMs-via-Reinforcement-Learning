 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Coffee-ground emesis, hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of massive diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely representing a
 combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, as described in previous
 reports.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No new parenchymal opacities.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  Unchanged position of the left PICC line.
