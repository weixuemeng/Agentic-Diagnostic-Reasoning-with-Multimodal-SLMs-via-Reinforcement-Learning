                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Permanent pacemaker is
 present with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs demonstrate
 biapical scarring as well as a vague 8 mm diameter right upper lobe opacity,
 possibly corresponding to an area of increased extrapleural fat and adjacent
 scarring in this region on recent PET-CT.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of mild compression
 deformity in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite pneumonia.  Vague 8 mm opacity in right upper lobe is
 potentially due to scarring, but a short-term followup radiograph may be
 helpful to exclude an early focus of pneumonia in this region if warranted
 clinically.
