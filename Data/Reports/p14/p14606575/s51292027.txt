                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Radiographs of the chest.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and PET-CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears in place with leads again terminating
 in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  The lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. A mild compression deformity of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body appears stable.  However, a mild to moderate upper thoracic
 vertebral body compression deformity is new since the prior radiographs,
 although it likely corresponds to increased FDG uptake noted previously in the
 T5 vertebral body on the recent prior PET.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
