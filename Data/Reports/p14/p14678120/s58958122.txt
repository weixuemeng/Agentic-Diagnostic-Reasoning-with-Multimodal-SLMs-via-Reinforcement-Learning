                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR and CABG with removal of his chest tube. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 19:46.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the endotracheal tube, enteric tube, Swan-Ganz
 catheter, and bilateral chest tubes have been removed.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower,
 accentuating by the bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for the changes in
 lung volume, mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions appear grossly stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has an
 expected postoperative appearance.  Sternal wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post chest tube removal.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
