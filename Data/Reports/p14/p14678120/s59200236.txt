                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG and aortic valve repair with postoperative
 pneumonia, interval followup.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ oral ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Compared
 to priors, the pulmonary vasculature is more engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  The left lower lung opacification is unchanged and
 likely represents atelectasis and a small effusion.  There is no right pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in vascular engorgement. 
 
 2.  Stable left lower lobe opacification likely represents atelectasis and a
 small effusion.
