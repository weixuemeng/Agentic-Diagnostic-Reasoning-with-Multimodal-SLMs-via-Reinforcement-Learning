                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles is most likely related to
 overlying soft tissue although trace pleural effusions would be difficult to
 exclude.  There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
