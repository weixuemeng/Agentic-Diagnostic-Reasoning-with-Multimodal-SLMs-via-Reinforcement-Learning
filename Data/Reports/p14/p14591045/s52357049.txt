                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with low grade temps and cough/hypoxia, also
 metastatic cancer unknown primary w/ lung nodules  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A cardiac conduction device is contiguous with leads which appear to terminate
 in right ventricle and bilateral atria.  Median sternotomy wires appear
 intact.  Surgical ___ appear unchanged.  Innumerable rounded pulmonary
 nodules are unchanged and consistent with metastatic disease.  Assessment for
 a consolidation is limited by numerous metastases, however there appears to be
 a loss of the cardiac silhouette and increased opacity at the cardiac apex,
 concerning for pneumonia.    Vertebral body heights are preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Assessment for pneumonia is somewhat limited given the patient's widespread
 metastatic disease, however increased consolidation at the cardiac apex and
 loss of cardiac silhouette is concerning for pneumonia.
