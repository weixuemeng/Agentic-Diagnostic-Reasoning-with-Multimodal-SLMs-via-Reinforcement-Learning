                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Rising white blood count.  Assess for infection.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Bibasilar opacities have increased due
 to increasing atelectasis on the right and likely aspiration on the left.  The
 right upper lobe opacities consistent with contusion have minimally improved. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
