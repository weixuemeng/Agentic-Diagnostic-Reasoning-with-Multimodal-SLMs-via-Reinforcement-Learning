                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and fungemia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation and the patient's chin and
 neck projecting over and obscuring assessment of the right lung apex medially.
 
 
 Right PICC tip appears to terminate in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes are reduced
 compared to the previous study.  Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is
 again noted.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable with minimal aortic knob
 calcifications.  Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly progressed compared to
 the previous exam.  There is persistent left perihilar opacity compatible with
 pneumonia, which appears unchanged.  Right basilar opacification appears
 slightly progressed  and is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Chronic
 fracture deformity of the left humeral neck is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Slight interval progression of mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 2. Worsening right basilar opacification concerning for pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Left perihilar opacification appears similar, and also likely
 reflects an area of infection.
