                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemodialysis with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is substantial increase
 in the opacification involving the left hemithorax.  However, there is also
 increased opacification of engorged pulmonary vessels on the right, suggesting
 that much of the change on the left may reflect pulmonary venous congestion
 rather than necessarily worsening pneumonia.  A lateral view would be helpful
 for further evaluation.
