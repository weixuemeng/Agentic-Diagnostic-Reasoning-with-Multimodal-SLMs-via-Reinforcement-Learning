                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Low-grade fever following recent right total knee replacement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for differences in technique,
 the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged.  There is
 similar mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the
 right.  Although there are patchy opacities at the left lung base, these are
 not probably out of proportion to what could be expected with post-operative
 volume loss.  It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions, particularly on
 the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite findings to suggest acute cardiopulmonary disease. 
 However, if there is persistent clinical concern for possible pneumonia,
 standard PA and lateral radiography may be helpful to assess the lungs with
 greater sensitivity for any possible infection.
