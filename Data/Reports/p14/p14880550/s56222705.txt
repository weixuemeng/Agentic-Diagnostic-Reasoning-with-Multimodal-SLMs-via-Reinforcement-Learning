                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis status post right total knee replacement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.  Single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes remain low exaggerating heart size and pulmonary vasculature. 
 The mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  There is stable blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle and eventration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 There is mild compressive bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with possible small left-sided effusion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No clear focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia however
 this study is limited and conventional PA and lateral views may be helpful if
 possible.
