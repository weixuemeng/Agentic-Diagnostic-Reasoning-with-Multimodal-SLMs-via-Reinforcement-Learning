                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  Elevated white blood count, evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition did not permit PA and lateral chest technique,
 but had to convert it to sitting examination using AP frontal and left lateral
 views.  Enlarged heart, as before.  High-positioned diaphragms conceal major
 portion of the heart shadow and diaphragmatic contours obscured by bilateral
 pleural densities that blunt the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses. 
 Mostly linear densities on the bases indicate crowded pulmonary vasculature
 most likely related to the bilateral pleural effusions.  Pulmonary vasculature
 again shows perivascular haze on the bases consistent with marked pulmonary
 congestion.  As before, the patient has a marked S-shaped scoliosis in the
 thoracolumbar spine with advanced degenerative changes.
 
 Comparison with the next previous examination demonstrates that the patient is
 still in left-sided heart failure with dilated heart shadow and bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates can be identified,
 but the possibility of some processes in the lung bases with the crowded
 pulmonary vasculature and partial atelectasis cannot be excluded.
