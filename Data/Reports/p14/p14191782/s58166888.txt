                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure and hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged.  Post-sternotomy wires are unchanged. 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of the right ventricle. 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities most likely consistent with mild degree of
 interstitial pulmonary edema newly developed as compared to prior radiograph. 
 No overt pleural effusion is seen with bibasal pleural thickening being
 unchanged.  No focal consolidations to suggest interval development of
 infectious process demonstrated.
