                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hip fracture. Preoperative chest films.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A single lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle. The patient
 is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart is mildly
 enlarged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Streaky
 opacities indicate chronic scarring at the left lung base with a small,
 probably chronic pleural effusion including loculation. The chest is
 hyperinflated. Very mild vascular congestion is suspected. The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest very mild vascular congestion. Stable atelectatic changes at
 the left lung base and chronic small left-sided pleural effusion. Stable
 cardiomegaly.
