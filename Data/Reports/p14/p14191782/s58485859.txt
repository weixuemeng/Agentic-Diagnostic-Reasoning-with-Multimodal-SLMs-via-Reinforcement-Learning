 clinical setting. There is mild pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is persistent cardiomegaly. No
 pneumothorax. There has been interval removal of the tracheostomy and right
 sided internal jugular central venous line. A pacemaker device is present,
 with a single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased opacification of the left base likely represents atelectasis and
