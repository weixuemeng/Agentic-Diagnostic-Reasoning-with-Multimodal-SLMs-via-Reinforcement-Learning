  1. Approximately 8.9 cm likely pleural based opacity in mid left hemi thorax
  is worrisome for loculated fluid collection.  Differential includes pneumonia,
  or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
  2. Bilateral perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities with small left
  pleural effusion is consistent with pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities are noted.  An
 approximately 8.9 cm opacity projecting of the left hemi thorax knee be
 pleural-based. No pneumothorax detected.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle could reflect a small left pleural effusion.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contour are grossly unremarkable for age, but the right and
 question left hila are prominent.

 3.  Prominent right and question left pulmonary hila.  Attention to these
 areas on followup films is requested.
