                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal pna now s/p intubation.  // s/p
 intubation, confirm ETT and OGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 04:04
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.2 cm above the
 carina.  A left IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off the film.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Compared to the prior film, again seen are focal relatively confluent
 opacities in the left lung laterally and in the right perihilar region, though
 no clear cut air bronchograms are identified.  There is also upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is
 increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, now with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm and a small left effusion.  Probable atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  Minimal opacity in the right costophrenic angle could
 represent either atelectasis or small amount of fluid.
 
 Spinal hardware noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube, NG tube, and left IJ central line in satisfactory position.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 2. CHF, which appears more pronounced than on the earlier film
 3. Multifocal opacities could represent either confluent CHF or multifocal
 pneumonia.  Other etiologies are not excluded.  In particular, attention to
 the right hilum after treatment of acute processes is recommended to exclude
 hilar enlargement.
 4. Considerable worsening of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 now with a small effusion.
