                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal pna now s/p intubation //
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip ends approximately 2 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 traverses the diaphragm and its tip is not visualized. The stomach is
 non-distended.  The tip of the left internal jugular line projects over the
 mid SVC. Retrocardiac opacity appears less conspicuous on today's exam.
 Bilateral focal opacities persist but are improved from the prior exam and
 likely represent combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Mild
 cardiomegaly persists and is unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is unchanged and suggests small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Incompletely visualized spinal hardware appears intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally improved pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.
