                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with new central line placement.  Assess central line
 placement.  Review of prior imaging reports refer to a history of lung cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval placement of a left IJ CVL with tip overlying the distal
 left brachiocephalic vein/SVC junction.
 
 Bilateral perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities are noted.  On the
 right, there is considerable perihilar opacity.  A 9.8 x 5.3 cm opacity
 projecting over the left hemi thorax is most likely pleural based and could
 represent focal consolidation or other confluent opacity, OR, possibly, a
 loculated pleural fluid collection.  No pneumothorax detected.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Heart size and mediastinal contour
 is otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left IJ CVL tip in left brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  No pneumothorax
 detected .
 2.  9.8 cm opacity in left mid hemi thorax --___ consolidation, confluent
 opacity, or loculated fluid collection.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 3.  Bilateral perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities with small
 bilateral pleural effusions is consistent with pulmonary edema.
 4.  Note is made that the ___ trachea CT described a handful of and
 new solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 3 mm in the right upper lobe
 worrisome for metastasis.  If clinically indicated, repeat CT could help to
 better characterize opacities seen on today's exam.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 5:47 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
