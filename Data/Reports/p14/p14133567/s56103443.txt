                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o tracheobronchomalacia presenting with
 sepsis secondary to pneumonia  // change from prior? edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ min past midnight
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there may have been slight interval improvement in
 the CHF findings.  Otherwise , I doubt significant interval change.  Again
 seen is a left IJ central line with tip over mid SVC an extensive perihilar
 and parenchymal opacities, including more confluent opacity at the lateral
 left lung.  There may have been subtle improvement in the lateral left chest
 opacity, but this may also be accentuated by differences in positioning. 
 Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle is also unchanged.
 
 The current film includes the proximal portion of the right humeral diaphysis
 and shows some increased density there.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight interval improvement in CHF findings.
 2. Parenchymal opacities, including opacity along the left chest laterally,
 otherwise essentially unchanged compared with earlier the same day.
 3. Possible deformity of the right humeral diaphysis.  Is there history of
 prior fracture?
