                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and elevated lactate question widened
 mediastinum, pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Slight prominence of the central vasculature may relate to low lung
 volumes although mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement may be present. 
 There is eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The mediastinum is not widened.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion. 
 Possible mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement although findings may
 relate to low lung volumes.
