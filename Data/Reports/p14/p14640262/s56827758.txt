                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female intubated, with head bleed, assess
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen, inferior aspect not included, however, seen to at
 least course into the expected location of the stomach.  There are relatively
 low lung volumes.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a
 trace pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Minimal bibasilar
 opacities may relate to mild aspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal tube placement, terminating
 approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina.  Left base atelectasis, with
 possible small effusion.  Mild bibasilar opacities could relate aspiration.
