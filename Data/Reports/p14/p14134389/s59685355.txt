                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG and AVR, evaluate for effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a right-sided IJ central venous catheter, the tip of which
 extends into the upper to mid SVC.  The patient is status post CABG and AVR,
 with sternotomy wires noted to be well aligned.  There is a moderate sized
 left pleural effusion identified with adjacent atelectasis.  A smaller
 right-sided pleural effusion is also noted.  No focal consolidations are noted
 within the lung parenchyma. Stable, post-operative air is noted with in the
 anterior mediastinum on the lateral projection. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema identified.  There is apparent cardiomegaly,
 although this is incompletely assessed due to the left-sided pleural effusion.
 Mediastinal contours appear to be stable.
