                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, esophageal  cancer//
 Evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy and linear opacities within the
 lower lobes bilaterally likely reflect areas of atelectasis, but early
 infection is not completely excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild degenerative spurring is noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, but pneumonia is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
