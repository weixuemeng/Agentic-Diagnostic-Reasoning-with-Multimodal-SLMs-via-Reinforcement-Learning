 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are quite low following surgery, and bibasilar opacification is
 presumably due to substantial atelectasis. Aspiration should be considered.
 Upper lungs are clear. Mild cardiomegaly is increased. There is no
 pneumothorax. Pleural effusions small if any.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium
 and would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to reposition it in the low SVC, if
 desired. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.
