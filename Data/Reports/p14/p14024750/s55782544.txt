                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post-op fever, expiratory wheezes  // eval
 for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Improving left lower lobe opacification is attributed to
 atelectasis. Worsening right lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Short-term radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard
