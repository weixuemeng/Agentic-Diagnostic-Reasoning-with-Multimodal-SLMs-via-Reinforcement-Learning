                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, now with
 acute altered mental status, here to evaluate position of recent central line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left supraclavicular approach central venous catheter is in place
 with the tip terminating at the superior SVC.  The course of the line is
 unremarkable without evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
 noted.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may represent
 a small amount of pleural fluid.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged
 and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged.  Mild calcification of the aortic knob is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left supraclavicular approach central venous catheter with tip in the
 upper SVC.
 
 2.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
