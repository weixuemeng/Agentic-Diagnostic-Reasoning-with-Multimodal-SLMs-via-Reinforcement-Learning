                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma and cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some ill-defined
 opacification at the base posteriorly on the lateral view.  This could well
 represent atelectatic changes as seen on prior studies.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  
 
 Compression deformity of the lower thoracic vertebral body is again seen on
 lateral view.
