                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits.  The aorta remains tortuous
 with similar aneurysmal dilatation.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There has been
 interval improvement in aeration of the lung bases with decreased atelectasis
 demonstrated.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Multiple remote bilateral rib fractures and compression deformities
 are again seen within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  Partially imaged is a
 stent graft within the abdominal aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the lung bases with residual atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 substantial interval change from the previous exam performed earlier the same
 day.
