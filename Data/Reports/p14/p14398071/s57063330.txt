                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded and clear. There is mildly
 coarsened interstitial pattern bilaterally. The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly coarsened interstitial pattern without focal consolidation
 or effusion could reflect bronchovascular crowding, less likely interstitial
 edema.
