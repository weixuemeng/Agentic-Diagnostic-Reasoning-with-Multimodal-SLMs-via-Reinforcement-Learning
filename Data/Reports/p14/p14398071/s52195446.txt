                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Large right pleural effusions have markedly decreased, now very small.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hazy
 opacities in the right middle lobe are likely atelectasis.
