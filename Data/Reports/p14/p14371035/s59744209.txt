 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  ET tube in standard
 placement.  Right internal jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 New hazy opacification in the lungs is probably early edema.  Mediastinal
 venous engorgement and increasing small right pleural effusion also reflect
 volume overload or cardiac decompensation.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Atelectasis in the right lower lung is associated with that
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
