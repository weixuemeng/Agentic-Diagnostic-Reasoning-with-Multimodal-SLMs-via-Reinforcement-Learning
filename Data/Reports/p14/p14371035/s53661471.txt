 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, the tip terminates
 2.3 cm above the level the carina.  Again seen are patchy bilateral airspace
 opacities in a predominately perihilar distribution consistent with pulmonary
 edema, infection cannot be excluded.  The extent of parenchymal changes
 similar when compared to the prior study.  No definite effusion seen.  A right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  An nasogastric tube
 terminates below the left hemidiaphragm.  The tip is not visualized on this
 study.  Degenerative changes in the bilateral shoulder joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change status post intubation.
