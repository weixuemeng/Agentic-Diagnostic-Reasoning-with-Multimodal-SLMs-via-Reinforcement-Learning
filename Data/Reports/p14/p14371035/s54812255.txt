 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:54 PM
  Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach however the side hole is at the
  level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. Again seen is
  elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and likely small pleural effusion.
  Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on ___ at

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SBO with NGT and large bilious output  //
 eval for NGT placement - too distal?      eval for NGT placement - too distal?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Heterogeneous opacification
 developing at the lung bases is probably worsening interstitial edema
 accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is
 essentially stable. No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper
 stomach and would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports
 below the diaphragm.
