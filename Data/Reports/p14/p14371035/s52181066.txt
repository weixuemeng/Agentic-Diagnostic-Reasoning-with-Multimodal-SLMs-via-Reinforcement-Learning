                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable chest view was read in comparison with
 prior chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm from carina, just above the level of
 clavicles.  Consider advancing ET tube by 2-3 cm for appropriate seating.  A
 right internal jugular line extends to mid/lower SVC and orogastric tube ends
 in the stomach.  Both lungs are remarkable for bilateral perihilar opacities,
 left side more than right and mild-to-moderate right and minimal left pleural
 effusion.  Though these findings favor pulmonary edema, concurrent pneumonia
 cannot be ruled out.  Right renal nephrostomy tube is present.  Heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral perihilar opacities, left side more than right and
 mild-to-moderate right and minimal left pleural effusions, though favor
 pulmonary edema, concurrently associated pneumonic cannot be ruled out.
 Attention is required on follow-up radiographs.
