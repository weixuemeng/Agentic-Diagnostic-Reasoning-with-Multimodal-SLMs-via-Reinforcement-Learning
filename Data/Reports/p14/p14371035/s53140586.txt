                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in configuration.  Previously
 identified right IJ central lines are no longer seen.  Right-sided PICC
 identified with tip seen to at least the lower SVC; however, exact tip cannot
 be delineated due to overlying osseous structures.  Severe degenerative
 changes at the shoulders bilateral in addition to multiple bilateral rib
 fractures and probable right thoracotomy changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although a
 component of infection cannot be excluded.
