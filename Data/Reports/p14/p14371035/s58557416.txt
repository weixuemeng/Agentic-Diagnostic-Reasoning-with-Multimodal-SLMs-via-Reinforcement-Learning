                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Sequela
 of prior rib injuries appear unchanged.  The bones are probably demineralized
 to some degree.  Severe degenerative changes are noted along the right
 shoulder.  The left humeral head also shows upward subluxation.  High-riding
 humeral heads may indicate underlying rotator cuff pathology.  Moderate spinal
 curvature is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
