                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is provided.  Patient is rotated
 to her left.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart is upper limits of normal in
 size, exaggerated by the low lung volumes.  Opacification projecting over the
 right middle lung zone may reflect sequela of atelectasis or aspiration though
 infectious etiology is difficult to exclude.  Obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural effusion.  Biapical pleural
 thickening may reflect layering pleural effusion.  There is no large
 pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Prominence of the vascular pedicle
 is likely secondary to patient positioning and low lung volumes.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.  Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearance of the chest relative to prior radiograph performed ___ is not significantly changed allowing for patient positioning and low
 lung volumes.  Opacification in the right midlung zone medially may be sequela
 of atelectasis or aspiration.  Infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 Thickening of bilateral apical pleura may reflect layering pleural effusion.
