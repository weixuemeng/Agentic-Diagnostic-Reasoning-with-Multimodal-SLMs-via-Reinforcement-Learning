                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fevers.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild dextroscoliosis centered in the mid thoracic spine as
 well as severe degenerative changes of both shoulders, which is not
 significantly changed from prior and compatible with neuropathic joints in the
 setting of known neuromyelitis secondary to SLE.  Post-thoracotomy changes are
 also noted in the right.  
 
 Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. Small oblong opacity in the left lower lung field
 projecting over a posterior rib likely relates to bony callus from prior
 fractures, better assessed in previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Small oblong
 opacity in the left lower lung field projecting over a posterior rib likely
 relates to bony callus from prior fractures, better assessed in previous CT. 
 Findings could be confirmed with oblique views.
