                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ARDS and urosepsis, assess placement of ET tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube courses into the stomach and out of view.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter terminates in the mid to distal SVC.  Portion of the patient's
 percutaneous nephrostomy tube appears to project over the right upper abdomen
 that is incompletely assessed.  
 
 Bilateral predominantly central perihilar opacities persist which accompanied
 by indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and bilateral pleural effusions
 suggest pulmonary edema.  More confluent consolidations are seen in the right
 upper lung and left mid-lung and could reflect superimposed pneumonia. A
 component of basilar atelectasis is also present.  The heart and mediastinum
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube 3.5 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Persistent perihilar opacities with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 While pulmonary edema is favored, accompanying multifocal pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
