                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, ARDS, and intubated; assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  Right
 internal jugular catheter is in the mid SVC.  Orogastric tube courses into the
 stomach and out of view.  Perihilar opacities are slightly improved compared
 to the prior study with overall decrease in apparent pulmonary edema.  Focal
 right upper lung consolidation is at most slightly increased in density.  The
 heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Minimally worsening right upper lobe opacity which could reflect developing
 pneumonia. 
 2. Perihilar consolidations, asymmetrically greater on the left, are slightly
 improved and likely reflect improved pulmonary edema.
