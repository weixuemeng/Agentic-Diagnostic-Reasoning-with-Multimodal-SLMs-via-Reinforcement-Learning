 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:43 AM
  1. Study was re-read once outside hospital CT scan was uploaded and apparent
  mediastinal widening is due to prominent mediastinal fat.
  2. Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
  radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
  cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
  either bone detail views or CT scanning.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 6:20 AM
  1. Mildly widened mediastinum measuring a 8.9 cm may be accentuated due to
  positioning and low lung volumes.  Clinical correlation is recommended to
  assess for mediastinal injury. 2. Although no fracture or other bone
  abnormality is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not appropriate for
  detection or characterization of chest cage lesions. Any focal findings should
  be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man + EtOH, found by fireman s/p assault, intubated
 for airway protection, coughing blood.  Assess for pneumothorax, hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 4.6 cm above the level of the
 carina.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is mildly widened measuring 8.9 cm however
 this study was re- read with the outside hospital CT scan up-loaded and the
 mediastinum is within normal limits. Heart size and hila are unremarkable.
 
 No displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Study was re-read once outside hospital CT scan was uploaded and apparent
 mediastinal widening is due to abundant mediastinal fat.
 2.  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.
