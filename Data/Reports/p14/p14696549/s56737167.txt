                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Loculated pneumothorax, question worsening.
 
 REFERENCE EXAMINATION:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the large lucency in the right mid lung, compatible
 with the patient's known loculated pneumothorax.  There is also increased
 lucency at the right CP angle and right apex suggesting possible extension of
 this process.  The left lung is clear.  
 
 Impression: Probable slight increase in right-sided loculated pneumothorax.
