  Again seen is a left-sided PICC line with distal tip projecting over the mid
  SVC.  Subtle streaky opacities at the left lung base likely represent
  subsegmental relaxation/platelike atelectasis in the setting of a suboptimal
  inspiratory effort and low lung volumes, however developing sequela of
  aspiration pneumonitis are difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical
  setting.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no evidence of
  pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and desat, coughing with liquids  //
 evaluate for pneumonia, aspiration, HF      evaluate for pneumonia,
 aspiration, HF
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indwelling left PIC line has been partially withdrawn, now in the mid SVC.
 
 New region of small opacities in the right midlung could be early pneumonia. 
 Linear opacities and peribronchial opacification at the lung bases is mild and
 could be additional areas of infection, but more likely this is atelectasis.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is exaggerated by low lung
 volumes, but there is no edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  Dilatation of
 the azygos vein is a chronic feature and should not be considered in
 indication of acute volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
