  The study is significantly limited by extensive pleural calcifications related
  to asbestos exposure.  Fullness of the the left hilum on the frontal view may
  represent mild fluid overload.  Opacity projecting over the left lung base and
  a lateral view may represent sequela of low lung volumes and pleural plaques,
  but underlying infection can't be excluded.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:44 AM
  
  The study is significantly limited by extensive pleural calcifications related
  to asbestos exposure. Increased opacity projecting over the left hilum on the
  frontal view and the left lower lobe on the lateral view may be sequela of
  lower lung volumes and pleural plaques but underlying infection can't be
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CAD, CABG, PE in the past  // Pulmonary
 Congestion, Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes extensive pleural plaques. 
 Increased fullness of the left hilum may represent mild volume overload. 
 Opacity projecting over the left lung base on the lateral view may represent
 sequela of low lung volumes and pleural plaques, but underlying infection
 can't be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The study is significantly limited by extensive pleural calcifications related
 to asbestos exposure.  Fullness of the the left hilum on the frontal view may
