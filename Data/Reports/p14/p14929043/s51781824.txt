                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There are midline sternotomy wires.  The heart sidze is normal. The
 aorta is calcified. Asbestos plaques are again noted. Increased vascular
 congestion appears relatively similar to the prior radiograph.  The plaques
 obscure evaluation for pneumonia.  If, there is a real concern for pneumonia
 chest CT is recommended.
