                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o multi lobar pneumonia 1 month ago  //
 evaluate for resolution of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is stable including prominence of the aorta,
 potentially reflecting mild dilatation of the ascending aorta.
 
 There is interval resolution of multiple focal consolidations demonstrated on
 the prior study with only minimal opacities noted in their place consistent
 with radial resolution. There are no new consolidations. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Repeated radiograph in 4 weeks for documentation of complete resolution is
 recommended.
