                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with low grade temps  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new reticular markings diffusely throughout both lungs likely
 reflecting pulmonary interstitial edema.  There are increased right basilar
 opacities as well as a stable opacification in the right upper lung zone which
 likely corresponds to the previously described right upper lobe mass.  No left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax identified.  The size of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased reticular markings diffusely throughout both lungs may reflect
 pulmonary interstitial edema.
 2. Increased opacities at the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis and a
 small pleural effusion.
 3. Right upper lobe opacity corresponds to the previously described the right
 upper lobe mass.
