                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with leukocytosis.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are
 well expanded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle likely represents a residual small pleural effusion, with interval
 improvement in left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable, with calcifications noted in the aortic knob.  Catheter tubing is
 present over the left upper quadrant, unchanged since the prior study.  Coarse
 interstitial markings are again noted, with no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema or focal airspace opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion is smaller compared to the prior study, and
 left basilar atelectasis has improved.  No evidence of pneumonia.
