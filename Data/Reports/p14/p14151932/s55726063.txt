 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, following lung biopsy there is a
 small to moderate left pneumothorax.  Area of increased opacification at the
 left base presumably reflects the lesion being biopsied.  There is also an
 opacification overlying the anterior second rib on the left, which should be
 checked on subsequent studies to see whether it represents a true abnormality.
