                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic carcinoma after Whipple's, to assess for worsening
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Opacification at the left costophrenic angle is
 consistent with some reaccumulation of pleural fluid with underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  There may be mild residual elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure, improved since the previous study.
 
 The course of the left subclavian vein and appearance of the tip suggests that
 the tube lies in the azygous vein.  Lateral radiograph could confirm this
 diagnosis.
