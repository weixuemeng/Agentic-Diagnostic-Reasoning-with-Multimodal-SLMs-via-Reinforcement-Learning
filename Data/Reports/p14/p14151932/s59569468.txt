                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which
 could be due to atelectasis, which may be due to atelectasis and low lung
 volumes.  There is a subtle lucency along the expected location of the left
 hemidiaphragm and free intraabdominal air is not excluded.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen, although trace left pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by AP,
 portable technique and low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 pulmonary edema seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Subtle lucency projecting along the left
 hemidiaphragm, free intraabdominal air not excluded and this may represent
 such.
