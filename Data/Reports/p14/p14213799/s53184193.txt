                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with removal of MV mass  // r/o ptx, s/p ct d/c
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of ET tube and NG tube and chest tubes.  No pneumothorax. No
 pleural effusions. Increase in left retrocardiac consolidation with associated
 volume loss likely atelectasis or pneumonia in the right clinical setting. 
 Atypical course of left IJ catheter suggests that the tip is in a persistent
 left SVC or one of its branches.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
 Median sternotomy wires again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Left retrocardiac opacity with associated volume loss may be
 atelectasis but in the right clinical setting can suggest pneumonia.  Again
 noted is the atypical configuration of the left IJ catheter likely in a
 persistent left SVC or one of its branches
