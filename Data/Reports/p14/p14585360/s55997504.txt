                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISON:  None available. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the

 lower lung opacification are seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Heart size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right mid lung consolidation and subtle left lower lung opacification,
 concerning for pneumonia.  Given the clinical history of seizure without other
 symptoms, fever or leukocytosis, differential diagnosis includes aspiration. 
 Alternatively, infection could have precipitated seizure.
