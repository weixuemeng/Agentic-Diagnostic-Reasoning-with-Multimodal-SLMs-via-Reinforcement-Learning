 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for leftward
 rotation.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal
 interstitial edema.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to
 atelectasis with adjacent small left pleural effusion.
