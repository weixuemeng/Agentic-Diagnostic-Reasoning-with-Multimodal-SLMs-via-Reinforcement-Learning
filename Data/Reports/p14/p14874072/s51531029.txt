                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mitral valve replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  Opacification at the left base is consistent
 with moderate effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Small right
 effusion is also seen with mild compressive atelectasis at the base.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
