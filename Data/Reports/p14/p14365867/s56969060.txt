                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Although partly obscured by opacification in the left hemithorax, the heart is
 probably normal in size.  Left hilum is obscured by a consolidation involving
 much of the central part of the left upper lobe with some accompanying volume
 loss and leftward shift.  Right hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is also a small pleural effusion on the left and, more
 generally, a diffuse interstitial abnormality including bilateral fissural
 which suggests coinciding pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the left upper
 lobe is heterogeneous and somewhat nodular although likely infectious.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Central consolidation in the left upper lobe suggesting pneumonia. 
 Particularly given the distribution and some possible nodularity, it is
 important to pursue follow-up radiographs to show resolution in ___ weeks if
 clinical circumstances also suggest pneumonia.  Otherwise chest CT is
 suggested.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with moderate coinciding pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Small pleural effusion on the left.
