  1. No displaced rib identified; however, conventional radiography is limited
  in sensitivity and, if there is clinical concern, a dedicated rib series
  should be obtained. 
  
  2.  Increased density over the right lung base may represent superimposition
  of ribs and the right nipple.  If there is clinical concern for pneumonia,
  shallow oblique radiographs could be obtained.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with left flank pain, here to evaluate for rib
 fractures.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are symmetrically well-expanded and well-aerated.  Increased density
 projecting over the right lung base most likely represents superimposition of
 normal structures including an anterior rib, a posterior rib, and the right
 nipple.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.  There
 is no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild biapical pleural
 thickening is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Bilateral pectoral deep brain stimulator devices are in place.
 No displaced rib are identified.  Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No displaced rib identified; however, conventional radiography is limited
 in sensitivity and, if there is clinical concern, a dedicated rib series
 should be obtained. 
 
 2.  Increased density over the right lung base may represent superimposition
 of ribs and the right nipple.  If there is clinical concern for pneumonia,
 shallow oblique radiographs could be obtained.
