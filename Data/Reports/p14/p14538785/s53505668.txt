                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion with chest tube in place.
 Please complete before 6 am. Evaluate pneumothorax and chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly lower, particularly on the right.  Left chest tube
 is unchanged. Left perihilar consolidation is increased since the prior study,
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  Previous moderate left pleural effusion is
 smaller and the heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base is likely a
 combination of atelectasis and edema. Increasing opacities at the right lung
 base may reflect a developing pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease in size of left pleural effusion, with bibasilar atelectasis, left
 greater than right, and slight decrease in lung volumes.
 Increasing opacities at the right lung base, while may reflect atelectasis,
 raise the concern for pneumonia. Continued surveillance is recommended.
