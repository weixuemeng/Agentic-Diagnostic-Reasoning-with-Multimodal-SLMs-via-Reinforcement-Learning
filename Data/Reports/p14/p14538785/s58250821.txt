                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GI bleed requiring intubation for urgent EGD
 // Assess ETT placement      Assess ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 19:46.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  The right jugular
 introducer is sharply folded and may be occluded.  Clinical correlation
 advised.  Right PIC line is traceable only to deep axilla at the edge of the
 right hemi thorax.
 
 Combination of residual left pleural effusion and extensive left lung
 consolidation is unchanged.  Lower lung volumes may account for greater
 vascularity in the right lung, but this could reflect early cardiac
 decompensation.  Followup advised.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup conventional chest radiographs for possible
 cardiac decompensation.  Clinical inspection right jugular sheath catheter
