                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged, likely reflective of a trace left
 pleural effusion.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial change from the previous study with unchanged blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, possibly due to a trace left pleural effusion. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
