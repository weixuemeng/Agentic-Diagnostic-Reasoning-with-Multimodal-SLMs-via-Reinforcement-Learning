                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with rib fractures and b/l PTX s/p fall
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside hospital CT of the cervical spine performed earlier
 today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   There is extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema within the left chest wall extending into the neck.  Streaky gas
 lucency projecting over the mediastinum is compatible with known
 pneumomediastinum, seen on CT of the cervical spine.  There is left basal
 airspace consolidation with possible small pleural effusion or hemothorax.  A
 small left pneumothorax is present without definite signs of tension.  The
 right lung appears grossly clear though likely with mild basal atelectasis. 
 The heart size appears grossly within normal limits.  Acute fractures of the
 left ribs 5, 6, 7 and 8 which appear displaced.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Acute displaced left rib fractures 5 through 8 with small left
 pneumothorax, left basal consolidation and probable small left effusion.
 2. Pneumomediastinum, left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema extending to the
 neck.
