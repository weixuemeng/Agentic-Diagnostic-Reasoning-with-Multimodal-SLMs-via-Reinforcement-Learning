                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LUL  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiographs from 1 day earlier, there is little
 overall change.  Trace left pneumothorax persists.   Small left pleural
 effusion with associated left lower lobe atelectasis is mildly improved.  No
 effusion on the right.  An ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung zone is
 unchanged and likely reflects atelectasis or pneumonia.  No new focal
 consolidation.  No central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Subcutaneous emphysema over the left
 lateral chest wall continues to improve.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent trace left apical pneumothorax.
 2. Mildly improved small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
 3. Stable ill-defined consolidation in the right lower lung, suggestive of
 atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  No new focal consolidation.
