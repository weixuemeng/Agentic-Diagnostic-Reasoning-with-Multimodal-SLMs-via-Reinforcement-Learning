                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LUL  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, moderate left anterior
 loculated hydropneumothorax is minimally increased.  Lung volumes have
 improved.  Trace left apical pneumothorax persists.  Mild subcutaneous
 emphysema over the left lateral chest wall continues to decrease.  Opacity in
 the right lower lung has improved, likely atelectasis.  Worsening opacity at
 the left lung base, likely atelectasis, though infection cannot be
 definitively exclude
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimally increased moderate left anterior loculated hydropneumothorax. 
 Improved lung volumes.
 2. Persistent trace left apical pneumothorax.
 3. Worsening opacity at the left lung base, likely atelectasis, though
 possibly reflecting pneumonia.
 4. Improved right lower lung opacity, most consistent with atelectasis.
