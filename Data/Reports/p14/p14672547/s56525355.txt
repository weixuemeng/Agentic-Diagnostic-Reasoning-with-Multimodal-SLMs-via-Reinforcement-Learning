                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Thoracotomy Left Lung Lobectomy, evaluate
 for post-op changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the most recent prior radiograph of ___, the lateral
 left chest tube has been withdrawn and a new pleural drainage catheter
 entering involve the left lung and terminating at the left lung apex has been
 placed.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  There is minimal if any
 pleural effusion.  Apical pleural capping is similar to prior studies. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is attributable to the pleural drainage catheter. 
 There is new opacification of the right upper lung in a configuration
 suggestive of right upper lobe collapse.  There is associated volume loss with
 rightward shift of midline structures including the distal trachea.  There is
 no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.  A mildly displaced posterior left
 sixth rib fracture is presumed postsurgical.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right upper lobe collapse.
 2. Interval exchange of pleural drainage catheters without evidence of
 pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
