 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  New
 pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema. 
 Additional patchy infrahilar opacities may reflect evolving a component of
 alveolar edema or secondary process such as aspiration.  Followup radiographs
 after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
