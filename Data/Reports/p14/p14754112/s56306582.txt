                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  There is no comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle left basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis; however,
 infection process is not excluded in appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis, but
 consolidation due to infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
