                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration PNA  // s/p intubation      s/p
 intubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs, ___ at 05:16.
 
 Following intubation, lung volumes have improved.  ET tube in standard
 placement.
 
 Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation, right lower lobe greater than left,
 is probably due to extensive pneumonia, perhaps concurrent noncardiogenic
 edema, although there are small pleural effusions.  Heart size remains normal
 and there is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest right heart failure
 or volume overload.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
