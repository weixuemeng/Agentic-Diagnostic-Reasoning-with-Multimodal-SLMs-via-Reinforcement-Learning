                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 is re- demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are re-
 demonstrated in the lung bases, not substantially changed in the interval.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
