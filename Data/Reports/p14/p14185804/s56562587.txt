                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with elevated white blood cell count, BUN/creatinine
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Streaky and patchy opacities in the lung bases are again noted,
 possibly reflective of atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic
 angles on the lateral view posteriorly suggests trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases likely atelectasis
 and probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Please note that infection or
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
