                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 Heart size is normal. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but
 no pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Linear and streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Degenerative changes
 are again noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
