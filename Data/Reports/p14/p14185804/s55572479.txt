                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ETT, sepsis  // ? ETT placement, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated towards the left.  Endotracheal tube terminates 6.2 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube terminates within the
 stomach.  Mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Calcifications are seen at the aortic
 arch.  Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Consolidation of the left lung base likely represents
 atelectasis.  Opacity at the medial right lung base may be secondary to
 rotation, although infection/aspiration at this site is not excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT terminating 6.2 cm above the carina.
 2.  Low lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, and left lower lobe opacity which
 likely represents atelectasis versus aspiration.
 3.  Opacity at the medial right lung base may be secondary to rotation,
 although infection/aspiration at this site is not excluded.
