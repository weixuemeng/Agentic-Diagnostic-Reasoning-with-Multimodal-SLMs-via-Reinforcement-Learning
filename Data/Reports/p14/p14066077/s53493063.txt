                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New onset atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits aside from slight calcification
 along the aortic arch and mild unfolding of the descending thoracic aorta. 
 The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 bones are probably demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along
 the thoracic spine.  A thoracic vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction
 shows a moderate anterior wedge compression deformity with sclerosis along the
 superior endplate.  There is incompletely characterized lower cervical spinal
 fusion and slight S-shaped curvature to the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Bony demineralization and moderate compression deformity involving a
 thoracolumbar vertebral body.
