                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, the
 endotracheal tube ends at the level of the carina. The NG tube ends in the
 stomach but the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. However there are vague
 opacities at the right cardiophrenic angle as well as in the retrocardiac
 region. There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no
 right-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Vague opacities in the right cardiophrenic angle as well as the left
 retrocardiac region may represent a combination of aspiration and atelectasis.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube should be pulled 4 cm as it is ending right at the level
 of the carina. NG tube should be pushed at least 5 cm as to have the side-port
 end within the stomach.
