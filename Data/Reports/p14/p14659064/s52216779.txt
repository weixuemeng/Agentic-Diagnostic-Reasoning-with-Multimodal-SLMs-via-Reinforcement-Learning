 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is probably
 a small new pleural effusion on the left side only with minimal associated
 atelectasis.  However, lung fields appear otherwise clear.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest trace new pleural effusion on the left with minimal
 associated atelectasis.
