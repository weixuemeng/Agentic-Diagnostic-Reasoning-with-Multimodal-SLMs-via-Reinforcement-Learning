 HISTORY:  Syncope, seizure.  Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph every ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Heart size is unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
