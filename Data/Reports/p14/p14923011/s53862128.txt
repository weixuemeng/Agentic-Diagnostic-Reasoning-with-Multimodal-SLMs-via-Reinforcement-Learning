                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and possible pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A moderately large wedge of atelectasis in the right lower lobe has recurred. 
 Medial to it is a region of questionable abnormality, including possible lung
 abscess or bronchiectasis.  If clinical situation warrants, chest CT scanning
 would be more revealing.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left
 lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
