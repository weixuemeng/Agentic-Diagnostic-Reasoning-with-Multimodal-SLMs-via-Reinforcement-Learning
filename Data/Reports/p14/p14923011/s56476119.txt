 HISTORY:  HCV cirrhosis with rising bilirubin, status post a right spigelian
 hernia repair, looking for source of infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval resolution of wedge-shaped opacity at the
 right lung base, which likely represented atelectasis.  Mild streaky opacities
 are present at bilateral lung bases, which likely represent atelectasis;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable. 
 There has been interval removal of an NG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of wedge-shaped opacity at right lung base;
 however, with bibasilar streaky opacities that are likely atelectatic in
 nature, however, cannot exclude infection given the appropriate clinical
 circumstance.
