                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diverticulitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or evidence
 of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Since this is not a true upright image, it
 is difficult to assess for pneumomediastinum.  There is the suggestion of a
 lucency paralleling the outer aspect of the left hemidiaphragm that could
 conceivably represent free intra-abdominal gas.  A true upright image or even
 CT would be necessary to assess for pneumoperitoneum.
