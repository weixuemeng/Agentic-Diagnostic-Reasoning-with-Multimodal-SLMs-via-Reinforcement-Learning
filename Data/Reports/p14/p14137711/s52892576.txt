  Since the prior study, there is no change in positioning of the right sided
  pleural catheter with heterogeneous opacification of the right lung base,
  likely a combination of atelectasis and fluid.  There is slight kinking of the
  mid course of the catheter, and correlation with catheter output is
  recommended.
