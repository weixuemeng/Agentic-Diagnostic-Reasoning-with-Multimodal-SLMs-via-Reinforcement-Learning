  Since the prior study, there has been removal of the right pigtail catheter
  with improvement in opacification of the right lung base, likely from interval
  thoracentesis.  Small amount of pleural fluid remains lung base.  Linear
  atelectasis at the right lung base is again noted.  No evidence of
  pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ___  // r/o pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the right pigtail catheter has been

 pneumothorax.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  At overall low
 lung volumes there is no evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
