                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, status post fall, here to evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process or traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, dated ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Perihilar fullness and azygous distention in the setting of cardiomegaly is
 likely related to mild heart failure.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Unchanged rib deformities are compatible with prior fracture. 
 Degenerative changes of the left acromioclavicular joint are also unchanged. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumonia.
 2.  Findings compatible with mild heart failure.
 3.  Old rib fractures.  Degenerative left AC joint disease.
