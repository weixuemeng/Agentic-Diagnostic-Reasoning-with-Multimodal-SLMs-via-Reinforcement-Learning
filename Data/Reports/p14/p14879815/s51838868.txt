                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion, question infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Diffuse increased interstitial
 opacities may reflect a combination of mild interstitial pulmonary edema with
 chronic interstitial abnormality. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.  Multiple remote
 bilateral rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally may reflect a combination mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema and chronic interstitial lung disease. No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
