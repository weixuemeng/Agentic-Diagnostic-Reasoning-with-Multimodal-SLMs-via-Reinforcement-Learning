                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.  Evaluation for pneumothorax or
 rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Background density of the lung parenchyma
 is increased though stable.  However, subtle irregular opacities in the right
 upper and lower lungs are increased from prior and may reflect underlying
 allergic alveolitis.  Non-emergent pulmonary evaluation is recommended.  There
 is no confluent consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Deformity of
 the seventh posterior right rib is unchanged from prior and corresponds with a
 healed fracture.  No acute rib fracture is identified.  Visualized vertebral
 bodies in the mid-thoracic spine demonstrate preserved height without
 compression deformity. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Healed fracture of the right posterior seventh rib.  No new fractures.
 3.  Subtle irregular opacities suggest an underlying chronic lung disease. 
 Non-emergent clinical pulmonary evaluation is recommended.
