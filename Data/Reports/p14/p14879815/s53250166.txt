                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers, chills, and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Perihilar fullness and azygos distension
 in the setting of cardiomegaly is probably due to mild heart failure. 
 Mediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia. Mild heart failure.
