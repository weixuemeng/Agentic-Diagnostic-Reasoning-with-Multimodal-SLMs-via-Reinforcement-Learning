                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs demonstrate mildly increased interstitial
 markings bilaterally.  There is no large confluent consolidation or effusion. 
 Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP
 technique and relatively lower inspiratory volumes.  Old posterior right rib
 fractures identified.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs may
 represent interstitial edema versus chronic underlying interstitial lung
 disease, similar to previous exam.
