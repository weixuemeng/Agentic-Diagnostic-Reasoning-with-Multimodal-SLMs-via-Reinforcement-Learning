                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // infiltrate, pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Mild prominence of the costochondral
 junction of the right first rib likely accounts for subtle nodularity at this
 level. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle nodularity projecting over the right anterior first rib likely reflects
 costochondral junction calcification. If patient has elevated risk factors for
 malignancy consider CT to further assess.
