                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man, pedestrian struck, possible lung nodule on 
 chest radiograph.  // Please obtain PA/LAT chest radiograph to further
 evaluate pulmonary nodule.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam.  This
 results in crowding of bronchovascular structures which somewhat obscures
 assessment of the potential pulmonary nodules seen on the previous radiograph.
 Additionally, atelectasis within both lung bases appears worse in the
 interval.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are without relevant changed.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Moderate degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes result in worsening bibasilar atelectasis and obscure
 assessment of the lung parenchyma, and in particular, the region of the
 potential pulmonary nodule seen on the previous radiograph.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiographs with shallow oblique images can be
 obtained when the patient is able to take a deeper inspiration. 
 Alternatively, low-dose CT can be obtained if clinically indicated.
