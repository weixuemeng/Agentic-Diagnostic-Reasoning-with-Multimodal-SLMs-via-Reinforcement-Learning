                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate ET tube and OJ tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  The tip is 3.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 tip is in the stomach.  The sideport is just distal to the EG junction and can
 be advanced few cms for more standard position.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly
 is accentuated by low lung volumes.  Right transvenous pacemaker lead
 terminates in standard position in the right ventricle.  Left lower lobe
 opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.  Bi-apical opacities, larger on the left side have
 increased, worrisome for aspiration.
