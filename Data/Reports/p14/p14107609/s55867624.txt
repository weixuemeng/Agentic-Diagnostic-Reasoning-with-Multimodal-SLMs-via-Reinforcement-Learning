                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with palpitations, assess for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Minimal perihilar vascular congestion is
 noted.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Ill-defined opacities project over lower thoracic spine, best
 seen on the lateral view, more conspicuous since prior.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged since ___.
 
 2.  Minimal perihilar vascular congestion.  Ill-defined opacity projecting
 over the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view may relate to low lung
 volumes, atelectasis, or less likely infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
