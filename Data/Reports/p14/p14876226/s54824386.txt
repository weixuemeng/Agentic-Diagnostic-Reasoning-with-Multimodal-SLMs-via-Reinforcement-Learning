                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:07 A.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 12:18.
 
 Single portable chest film ___ at 5:07 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer is again seen with the right ventricular lead
 not entirely included on the study.  Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in
 position with tip in the mid-to-distal SVC.  Diffuse reticular and
 interstitial opacities, predominantly in the upper lobes are again seen,
 possibly related to radiation.  More focal opacity at the left base not
 significantly changed since ___ at 8:57.  This may reflect underlying
 interstitial disease, aspiration, atelectasis or pneumonia.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours do not
 appear to be changed given differences in technique and positioning between
 studies.
