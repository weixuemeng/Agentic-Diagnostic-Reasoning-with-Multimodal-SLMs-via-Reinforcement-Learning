 in the upper lobes bilaterally compatible with pneumonia.  Mid and lower lungs
 appear well aerated and clear.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Heart size appears within normal limits.  No free air is seen below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  An aortic stent is partially visualized in the upper
 abdomen.
