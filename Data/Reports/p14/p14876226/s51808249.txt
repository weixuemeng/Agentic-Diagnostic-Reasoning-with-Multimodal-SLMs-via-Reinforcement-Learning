                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Likely PCP or other atypical pneumonia, worsening oxygen
 requirement, question of interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new heterogeneous opacities in the left mid and lower
 lung as well as right lower lung in addition to the previously seen biapical
 heterogeneous opacities.  No definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 The pacemaker leads are in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: In addition to the biapical radiation changes, there is likely
 overlying atypical organism infection, possibly PCP, or drug toxicity from
 chemotherapy that has now spread to the left mid, left lower, and right lower
 lung fields.
