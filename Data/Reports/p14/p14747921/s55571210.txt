                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM UPRIGHT ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 944.
 
 A single portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing along the trachea and left mainstem
 bronchus with the tip projecting over the left mid to lower lung. 
 Re-positioning was recommended by Dr. ___ ___ provided a wet reading on
 ___ at 8:49pm.  Subsequent chest film from ___ at ___ documents
 satisfactory position of the feeding tube.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 consistent with underlying emphysema.  Patchy opacity at the right base may
 reflect an area of early pneumonia or aspiration.  Atelectasis would be less
 likely given its focality.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  Aorta is
 unfolded and tortuous.  Heart remains within normal limits of size.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
