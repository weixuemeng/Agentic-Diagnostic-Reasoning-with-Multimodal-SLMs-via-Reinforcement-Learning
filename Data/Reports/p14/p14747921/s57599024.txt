                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post left frontal craniotomy.  Assess for
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior study, the right lower lobe opacities
 have actually improved.  Minimal left lower lobe opacities remain, probably
 consistent with atelectasis versus aspiration.  Cardiac size is stable and
 normal.  Aorta is slightly unfolded.  Hilar contours are normal.  No pleural
 effusion and no evidence of pneumonia. Hyperinflation corresponds to
 emphysema. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared to seven days prior, little change in the left lower
 lobe opacities, perhaps representing atelectasis versus aspiration.  Improving
 right lower lobe opacities.
