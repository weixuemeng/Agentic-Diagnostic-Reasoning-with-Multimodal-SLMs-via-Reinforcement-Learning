                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval re-positioning of the Dobbhoff feeding tube which now has its tip
 coursing below the diaphragm and projecting over the expected location of the
 stomach.  
 
 2.  Patchy opacity at the right base remains concerning for either early
 pneumonia or aspiration.  A more subtle opacity is also now seen at the left
 base, which raises concern for a second area of possible aspiration or patchy
 atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 consistent with underlying emphysema.  No evidence of pleural effusions,
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
