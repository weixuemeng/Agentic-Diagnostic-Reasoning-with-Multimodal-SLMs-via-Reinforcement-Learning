                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemia  // eval for interval change    
 eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 05:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 The left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its tip
 in the proximal right atrium.  Stable bilateral diffuse parenchymal process in
 the setting of layering bilateral effusions likely reflects severe pulmonary
 edema; diffuse infection cannot be excluded.  Due to the diffuse parenchymal
 process, cardiac mediastinal and contours cannot be assessed.  No obvious
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi-erect technique.
