                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve replacement. 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, increased in size on the left, and similar in size on
 the right. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 compressive atelectasis. Previously demonstrated left apical pneumothorax
 appears resolved. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size on the left, and
 unchanged on the right, with bibasilar atelectasis.
