                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p readmit for fevers  // eval for
 effusion/pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there may have been slight interval increase in
 the opacity at the left lung base. A small left effusion is again seen. On
 today's exam, the right pleural effusion may also be slightly smaller.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant change. No CHF or other areas of infiltrate
 identified. Sternotomy wires, background cardiomegaly, and background
 hyperinflation are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially no significant change compare with the prior film. Possible slight
 increase in the degree of opacity at the left lung base and minimal
 improvement in the right pleural effusion.
