                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with advanced esophageal Ca and known effusion
 with worsening resp status and hypoxia.  // Please evaluate for worsening
 pleural effusions vs other etiologies.     Please evaluate for worsening
 pleural effusions vs other etiologies.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 14:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 08:12 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right sided Port-A-Cath unchanged in position.  Lung volumes are lower with
 crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  Bilateral increasing effusions with
 associated persisting consolidation in the left lower lobe and more patchy
 opacity at the right base favoring atelectasis, although superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in
 positioning and inspiration between studies.
