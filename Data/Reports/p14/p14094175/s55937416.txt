                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after a C-section complicated by infected
 hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are low generally and greater opacification in the infrahilar
 left lower lung is at least atelectasis, should be followed to exclude the
 development of pneumonia.  Heart size is physiologic given recent pregnancy,
 low lung volumes and AP radiographic technique.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or any appreciable pleural effusion.  ET tube tip is at the upper margin of
 the clavicles, acceptably positioned 4.5 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 would need to be advanced at least 12 cm to move all the side ports into the
 distended stomach.  Dr. ___ was notified by Dr. ___ at 12:05 a.m.
