                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:35 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through 7:43 p.m.:
 
 A new nasogastric feeding tube with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper
 part of a non-distended stomach.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Leftward mediastinal shift suggests that heterogeneous opacification at the
 base of the left lung has a component of atelectasis, not surprising given
 recent tracheal extubation, but raises concern for aspiration.  Clinical
 assessment advised.  No pneumothorax.
