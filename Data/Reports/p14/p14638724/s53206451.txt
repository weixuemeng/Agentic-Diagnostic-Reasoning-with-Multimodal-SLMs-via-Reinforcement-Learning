                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest, 4:39 a.m. on ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with endotracheal tube, assess change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now in standard position.  Left
 subclavian line ends close or just beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Relative
 hyperlucency of the right hemithorax is due in part to relative hyperinflation
 of the right lung, probably otherwise a radiologic technical artifact.  There
 is no good evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size normal.
