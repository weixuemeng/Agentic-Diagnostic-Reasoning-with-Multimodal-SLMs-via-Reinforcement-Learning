                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Focal opacity within the left mid lung field, likely within the
 superior segment of the left lower lobe, is concerning for pneumonia.  The
 right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs after treatment are
 recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
