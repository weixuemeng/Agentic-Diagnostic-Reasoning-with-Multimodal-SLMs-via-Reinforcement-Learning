                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  As previously
 mentioned, there is a small nodular opacity in the left lower lung, which
 could represent a calcified granuloma or possibly a bony abnormality in the
 chest wall.  Given the stable appearance since a remote chest radiograph dated
 ___, a benign etiology is favored.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without
 worrisome consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.  Degenerative changes in the spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  Nodularity in the left mid to
 lower lung is stable from multiple prior exams and is likely benign. 
 Otherwise unremarkable exam.
