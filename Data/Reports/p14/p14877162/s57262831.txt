                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible nodule on chest x-ray.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Oblique views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Shallow right posterior oblique (incorrectly labeled as LPO) view again shows
 a 12 mm circumscribed nodule projecting over the left lung and sixth rib.  The
 nodule is not seen on the RPO view. Otherwise, lungs are clear. No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Heart is normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 12 mm nodule projecting over the left lung for which further evaluation with a
 nonemergent chest CT is recommended.  As the nodule was not visualized on the
 RPO view, it is possible that this is located within the chest wall.
