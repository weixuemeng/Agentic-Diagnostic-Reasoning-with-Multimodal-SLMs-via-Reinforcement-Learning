                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with syncope and tachycardia.  Suspect PE.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Lungs are much lower in volume today, exaggerating heart size which is
 probably normal.  While today's study suggests a ___-mm lung nodule projecting
 on the frontal view over the left fourth anterior interspace, there was a
 similar abnormality in ___.  As far as I can tell, there has been no CT
 evaluation, nor is one indicated given the patient's age and long-term
 stability of the questioned lesion.
 
 There is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion or evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.  This examination neither suggests nor
 excludes the diagnosis of acute or chronic pulmonary embolism.
