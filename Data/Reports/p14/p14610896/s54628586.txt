                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman postoperative day 1 with fever, crackles on
 lung exam.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Low lung volumes are noted bilaterally with
 crowding of bronchovascular markings, but no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is noted.  There is mild blunting of the costophrenic angles on
 lateral view which may reflect trace pleural effusion.   Cardiac size is
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.
 Lucency along the trachea likely represents swallow in transit. Mild deviation
 of the trachea likely reflects low lung volumes. Recommend repeat imaging at
 full inspiration.
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:22 a.m. on ___ via
 telephone. Updated findings were also discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:56am on
 ___ via telephone.
