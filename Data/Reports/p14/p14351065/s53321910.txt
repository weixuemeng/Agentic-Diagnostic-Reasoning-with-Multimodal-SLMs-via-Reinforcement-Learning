 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change in the position of
 the tip of the Port-A-Cath, which is in the mid SVC.  Little change in the
 opacification at the left base, most likely reflecting pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to exclude, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
