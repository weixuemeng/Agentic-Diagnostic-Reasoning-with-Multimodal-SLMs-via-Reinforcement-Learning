  Compared with chest radiographs of ___, new left basilar
  and retrocardiac opacity causing obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm could
  represent developing infection, given the clinical history.  However, it could
  also simply be a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Evaluation
  with PA and lateral radiographs could be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML, neutropenic, with new fever.  // eval
 for pneumonia      eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at
 the left base obscuring the hemidiaphragm.  This could represent merely
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  However, in view of the clinical history,
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 A lateral view would be helpful if the patient could assume this position.
