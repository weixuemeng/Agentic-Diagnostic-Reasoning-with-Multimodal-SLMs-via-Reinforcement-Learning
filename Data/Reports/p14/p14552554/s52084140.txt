                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with prior radiographs, again seen is near complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax owing to lower lobectomy and total
 collapse of the residual upper lobe as well as leftward mediastinal shift. The
 right lung however shows increased vascular congestion and interstitial
 thickening as well as a probable small pleural effusion.  Lucency projecting
 over the mid chest, best seen on the latera view, is of unclear etiology, but
 could related to dilated, air filled esophagus.  Minimal fibrotic changes are
 unchanged. Lumbar spine hardware is redemonstrated.  Stable severe compression
 of a lower thoracic vertebra.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema in the right lung. 
 Again seen near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with complete
 collapse of the residual left upper lobe and lefward mediastinal shift.
 Lucency projecting over the mid chest, best seen on the latera view, is of
 unclear etiology, may have been present previosuly and possibly related to
 dilated, air filled esophagus.
