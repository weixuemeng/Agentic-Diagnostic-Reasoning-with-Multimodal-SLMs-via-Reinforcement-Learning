                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple pneumonias with remote left lower lobectomy, chest pain
 and cough for one week.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Changes of left lower lobectomy, with volume loss
 ipsilateral and mediastinal shift.  Continued near-complete opacification of
 the residual left lung, with minimally improved aeration.  Multiple air-fluid
 levels, raising concern for multiloculated abscesses.  Right lung is
 hyperexpanded and clear, with resolution of prior opacities.  Heart size is
 grossly normal, though shifted to the left and obscured by left hemithorax
 opacification.
 
 Bones are diffusely demineralized.  Chronic compression deformity at the
 thoracolumbar junction with near-complete loss of height, resulting in acute
 kyphosis.  Posterior laminectomy and fusion of the upper lumbar spine.  Mild
 bilateral acromioclavicular arthropathy.  Mild cervical spine .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible left lung necrotizing pneumonia, with minimally improved aeration
 since prior.
 2.  Clear right lung.
