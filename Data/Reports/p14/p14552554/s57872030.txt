                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of productive cough and
 history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right lower
 lobe consolidation has significantly decreased in the interval, with mild
 residua remaining.  There is near-diffuse opacity of the left hemithorax with
 some areas of lucency in the left lung and the left upper lobe which may
 represent slightly improved aeration.  There is subsequent again marked
 hyperexpansion of the right lung with displacement of the mediastinal contours
 to the left.  Patient has reported history of prior left lower lobectomy.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unable to be accurately assessed due
 to the left hemithorax opacification.
 
 There is severe compression of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction,
 without significant interval change.  Posterior fusion hardware is also seen
 at the upper lumbar spine again.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in superior right lower lobe consolidation with mild
 residual opacity remaining.  Suggest followup to resolution.
 2.  Status post left lower lobectomy with chronic opacity involving a
 significant portion of the left hemithorax and left-sided volume loss.  There
 is slightly improved aeration of the left upper lobe.
