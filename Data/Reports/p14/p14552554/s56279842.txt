                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia to 80s at office
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CTA chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacification of the left hemithorax is re- demonstrated compatible with
 chronic left upper lobe collapse and left lower lobeectomy changes.  Leftward
 shift of mediastinal structures is re- demonstrated as result of the volume
 loss.  The right lung demonstrates linear scarring or atelectasis within the
 mid lung field, but is without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is present.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is again noted with chronic compression deformity of T12 and
 evidence of posterior fusion within the upper lumbar spine.  Left-sided rib
 deformities are compatible with prior surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic opacification of the left hemithorax compatible with chronic left
 upper lobe collapse and prior left lower lobectomy changes.  Right lung is
 essentially clear.
