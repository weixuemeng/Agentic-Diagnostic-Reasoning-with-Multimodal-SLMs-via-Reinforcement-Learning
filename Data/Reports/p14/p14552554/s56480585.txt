                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient has reported history of prior left lower lobectomy.  Severe chronic
 left pulmonary changes with evidence of volume loss in the left hemithorax
 persist; however, there is increased opacification projecting over the left
 hemithorax.  Hyperexpansion of the right hemithorax persists.  There has been
 interval development of a large area of consolidation in the right mid lung
 field.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unable to be assessed due to
 the left hemithorax opacification.  Fixation hardware is noted in the upper
 lumbar spine, not optimally evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New consolidation in the right mid lung, pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
 2.  Extensive chronic changes in the left hemithorax with volume loss,
 however, with increased opacification of the left hemithorax as compared to
 the prior study, and underlying acute process (consolidation, worsening
 collapse, underlying pleural fluid) is of concern.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.  If patient able, PA and lateral views would be helpful for
 further evaluation.
