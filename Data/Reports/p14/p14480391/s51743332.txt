                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fevers, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Extensive right lower lobe opacity, associated with a
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion, likely caused by an infection.  On today's
 radiograph, the left upper lung region has also become slightly denser than on
 the previous image, but without definite signs of infection.
 
 No left pleural effusion.  Normal appearance of the right lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right basal pneumonia with associated
 pleural effusion.
