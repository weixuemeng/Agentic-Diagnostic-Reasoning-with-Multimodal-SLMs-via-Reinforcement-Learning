                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there may be slight increase
 in the opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm,
 consistent with substantial collapse of the right lower lobe and layering
 effusion.  The left lung is essentially clear.
