                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the right upper lung is a small nodular
 focus measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter and relatively hypodense, but
 potentially calcified.  However, a soft tissue lung nodule could be
 considered.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.  Potential lung nodule projecting over the
 right upper lung; preliminary reading entered while the patient was still in
 the ER.  When clinically appropriate, evaluation with chest CT and short-term
 followup is recommended.
