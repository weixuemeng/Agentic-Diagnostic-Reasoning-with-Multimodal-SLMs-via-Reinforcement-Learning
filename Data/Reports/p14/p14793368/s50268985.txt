                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is noted.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, suggesting underlying chronic
 obstructive lung disease. The heart is enlarged, with prominence of the left
 atrium, increased from ___, and there is widening of the central vascular
 pedicle, with increased interstitial markings most compatible with congestive
 heart failure.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is calcified, and the descending aorta is
 tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine, with osteopenia limiting evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased cardiomegaly with prominent interstitial markings compatible with
 mild congestive heart failure.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests
 underlying COPD.
