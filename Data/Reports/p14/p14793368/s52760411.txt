                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, which could
 relate to fluid overload versus an underlying chronic interstitial process. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette
 persistently enlarged and the aorta calcified and tortuous.  There appears to
 be minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles and trace effusions
 may be present.
