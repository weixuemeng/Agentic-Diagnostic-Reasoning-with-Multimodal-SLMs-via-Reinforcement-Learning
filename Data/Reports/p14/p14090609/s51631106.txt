                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of WPW after motor vehicle
 collision, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume.  An apparent new nodular focus projecting over
 the left mid lung may represent an artifactual confluence of shadows versus a
 true lung nodule.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.  
 
 2.  Newly apparent nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung, possibly
 a lung nodule versus artifact; when clinically appropriate, repeat PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended to evaluate further or alternatively chest
 CT could be considered.
