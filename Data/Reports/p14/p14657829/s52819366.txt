                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  leukocytosis, lung changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the multifocal parenchymal
 opacities are still clearly visible.  They might, however, be minimally less
 extensive.  Distribution and morphology of the opacities is still suggestive
 of multifocal pneumonia rather than of pulmonary edema.  In fact, except for
 presence of a small left effusion and mild cardiomegaly there are no
 indicators for pulmonary edema on the current image.
