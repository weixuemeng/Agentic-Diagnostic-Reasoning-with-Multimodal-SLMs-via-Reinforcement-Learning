                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating 4 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube tip courses through the stomach, with tip projecting off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Left basilar chest tube remains in unchanged
 position.  The heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are relatively unchanged, with mild calcification of the thoracic aorta noted.
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with cephalization of the
 pulmonary vascular markings, new compared to the prior exam.  Partially
 loculated right pleural effusion which is moderate in extent appears
 relatively unchanged, and a small left pleural effusion persists.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube tips are in standard positions.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary edema, new compared to the prior study.
 
 3. Moderate sized, partially loculated right pleural effusion and small left
 pleural effusion are unchanged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.
