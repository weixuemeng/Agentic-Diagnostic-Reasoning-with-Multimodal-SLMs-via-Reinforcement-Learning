                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate left-sided effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Adjacent to the
 pleural effusion there is rounded consolidation, which is presumably
 atelectasis.  To better evaluate, could consider a thoracentesis followed by a
 chest CT.  A small right pleural effusion has decreased in size.  There is no
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large unchanged left pleural effusion.
 2.  Decrease in size of right pleural effusion.
 3.  No pulmonary edema.
 4.  Presumed left basilar atelectasis.  If clinically indicated, could better
 evaluate this consolidation with a CT performed after a thoracentesis.
