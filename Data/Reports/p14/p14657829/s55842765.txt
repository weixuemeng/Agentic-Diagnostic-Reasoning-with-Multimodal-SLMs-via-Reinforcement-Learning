 Left pleural effusion has additionally increased in the interim, currently
 large in size.  Its upper portion appears to be lobulated and may correspond
 to atelectasis, although parenchymal process cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is central in position.  Right lung is essentially
 clear.  Minimal amount of right pleural effusion is present, appears to be new
 as compared to prior examination.
