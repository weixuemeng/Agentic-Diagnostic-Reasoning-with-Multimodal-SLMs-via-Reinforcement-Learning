                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain status post Cordis catheter removal for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Even allowing for the AP projection, there may be mild cardiomegaly.  There is
 a loculated right-sided pleural effusion, minimally increased over prior
 study.  There is a smaller left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged from prior
 study.  The patient appears to be otherwise relatively euvolemic.
 
 There is no evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are identified at the right
 shoulder in particular.  Osseous structures are otherwise grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Little interval change from prior study.  No pneumothorax or acute pulmonary
 findings.
 
 Projected over the left heart border is an unchanged catheter.
