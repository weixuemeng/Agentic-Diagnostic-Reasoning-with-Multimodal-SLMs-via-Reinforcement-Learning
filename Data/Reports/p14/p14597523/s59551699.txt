                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, please evaluate for
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  There are relatively low lung volume. 
 Faint opacification projecting over the cardiac silhouette may correlate to
 faint opacification at the left or medial right border of the heart, could be
 due to early infectious process vs atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
