                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement, repositioning, reevaluation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is seen projected over the left lower quadrant, most likely in
 the stomach.  The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there is interval development of left lower lobe
 opacity, peripheral that might reflect pleural effusion or less likely
 aspiration/interval development of infection.  Continued attention to this
 area is recommended.
