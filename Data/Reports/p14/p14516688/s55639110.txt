 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is slightly increased hazy opacity at the left lung base.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  A double-lumen
 right central venous catheter, prosthetic mitral valve, and median sternotomy
 wires are again identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Axillary stent on the

 Slightly increased hazy opacity at the left lung base, which likely represents
 atelectasis, however developing consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
