                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the right
 atrium.  Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve
 replacement.  Dense coronary artery calcifications are noted.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, perhaps slightly decreased in size from the
 prior study.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Left axillary vascular stent is partially imaged.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
