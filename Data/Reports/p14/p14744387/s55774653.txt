                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 03:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with altered mental status, intubation, now
 question interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 23:11.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 04:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip likely
 within the proximal small bowel.  A portion of an inferior vena caval filter
 is also seen.  Interval extubation.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.  Lung
 volumes remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and no definite
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
