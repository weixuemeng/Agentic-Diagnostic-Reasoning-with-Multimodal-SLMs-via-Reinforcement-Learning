 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is limited by patient rotation to the left.  There is
 dense consolidation seen within the left hemithorax, which may represent a new
 pneumonia or left lung collapse.  There is lower left lung volume than
 previously seen.  Right lung remains low volume, unchanged from prior study. 
 Obscuration of left hemidiaphragm suggesting left lower lobe collapse.  An NG
 tube is seen ending within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in left lung volume with new area of
 consolidation.  However, study is technically limited by patient rotation and
 this finding may also represent volume loss.  
 
 Dr. ___ was called at extension ___and additional AP radiograph
 without rotation was recommended at 4:55 p.m. by ___ via phone.
