                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob/hemoptysis.  Additional history from prior radiology
 reports of metastatic lung carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen right PleurX catheter is no longer visualized. Overall, the
 appearance of the right lung has not significantly changed noting increased
 hazy opacity overlying the right hemi thorax due to component of pleural
 thickening and parenchymal opacities. Loculated pleural effusion identified at
 the base as on prior.  The left lung remains clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Ventricular shunt catheter projects over the anterior
 chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change. Findings compatible with right-sided pleural
 thickening, loculated effusion and parenchymal opacities. Mediastinal
 adenopathy better seen by prior CT scan.
