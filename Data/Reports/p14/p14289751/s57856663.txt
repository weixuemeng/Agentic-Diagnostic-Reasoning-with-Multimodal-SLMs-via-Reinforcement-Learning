                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with lung cancer and history of pleural
 effusions presenting with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___ and CT
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with only a small amount
 of aerated lung at the right apex.  Heart is normal in size, and there is no
 significant shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The left lung is
 clear. Nonvisualization of the right bronchus may be due to mucus plugs. 
 There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus as compared to the
 prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Markedly increased large right pleural effusion with only a small amount
 of aerated lung remaining at the apex.
 2.  Interval development of a small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Nonvisualization of the right bronchus may be due to mucus plugs.
