                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pleural effusions, status post chest tube placement. 
 Please evaluate for interval change in effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube is overall in similar position compared to
 the prior exam; however, there has been interval improvement of a moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion with opacification of the right lung base likely
 secondary to re-expansion edema.  There has been interval increase in the
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  There may be a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  The remainder of the left lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Again seen is a ventriculoperitoneal shunt coursing
 across the chest to the right of midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of a moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
 opacity, likely secondary to re-expansion edema.
 
 2.  Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax.
