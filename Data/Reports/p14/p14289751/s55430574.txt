                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt courses across the chest to the right
 of midline. There is a large pleural effusion, including opacification of the
 lower two-thirds of the right hemithorax with balanced mass effect, noting
 only mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  This implies that there
 is extensive atelectasis associated with parts of the right lung.  Part of the
 right lung apex appears normally aerated, however.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion on the left.  The left lung remains clear.  Findings in the
 right chest are new.  
 
 IMPRESSOIN: New large right-sided pleural effusion.
