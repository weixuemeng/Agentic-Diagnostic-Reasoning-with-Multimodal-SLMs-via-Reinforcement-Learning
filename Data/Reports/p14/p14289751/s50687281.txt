                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dysphagia.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  A tubular structure projects over the right paracentral
 thorax along the anterior chest wall, likely signifying a VP shunt.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits without
 evidence of posterior mediastinal mass.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
