                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The patient's
 kyphotic positioning limits the evaluation with patient's chin obscuring the
 superior mediastinum.  There are bilateral linear opacities in the lower
 lungs, most compatible with atelectasis.  No convincing signs of pneumonia,
 CHF, or pleural effusion.  The heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal
 contours cannot be assessed.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung atelectasis.  Limited exam.
