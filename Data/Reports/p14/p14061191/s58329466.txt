                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall preop cxr  // preop
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 frontal views of chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild right lung base opacity is likely atelectasis, however pneumonia is
 possible in correct clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusion.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is similar to before. 
 Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild right lung base opacity is likely atelectasis.  Chronic mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly.  No evidence of cardiac decompensation.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
