                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CHF, sleep apnea, severe esophageal
 dysmotility, now presents with hypoxia, question aspiration pneumonia versus
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  There is linear
 opacity in the lower lungs, which is most compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis, though a component of aspiration or pneumonia would be difficult
 to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable with coronary stent
 noted along the left heart border.  The bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRSSION:  Lower lung linear opacity most compatible with atelectasis, though
 a small component of aspiration or pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in
 the correct clinical setting.
