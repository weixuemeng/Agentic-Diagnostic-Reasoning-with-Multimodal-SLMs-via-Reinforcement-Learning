                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___, chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema, and 
 biapical pleural scarring is unchanged. Airspace opacity, predominantly within
 the mid left lung, likely reflects atelectasis, although underlying infection
 cannot be excluded. No lobar consolidation or large pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  A gastrostomy tube
 projects over the mid left abdomen. Dextroscoliosis centered in the lower
 thoracic spine is unchanged.  PEG tube in the right upper quadrant again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with biapical scarring consistent with underlying
 emphysema. Predominantly left midlung airspace opacity likely represents
 atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 Followup imaging should be considered.
