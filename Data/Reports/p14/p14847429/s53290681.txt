                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post repair of leaking aortic graft.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A right vascular introducer sheath
 terminates near the junction between the right internal jugular and subclavian
 veins.  A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  Although the right lung appears clear, there is opacification of
 the left lower hemithorax suggesting, most likely, a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion, although not specific.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines, tubes, and drains as above.  Opacification of the left
 lower hemithorax suggestive of atelectasis and perhaps pleural effusion.
