 be due to underlying infection, atelectasis, or aspiration.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle and a small pleural effusion is not excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.
