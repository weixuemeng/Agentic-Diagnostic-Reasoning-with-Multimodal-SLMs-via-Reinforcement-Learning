                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with coughing.  Evaluate for
 infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  The thoracic
 aorta is mildly widened and elongated but no local contour abnormalities are
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  Moderately accentuated kyphotic curvature in the
 thoracic spine coincides with mild degree of degenerative changes mostly in
 the form of osteophytic reactions at the anterior vertebral body edges.  No
 vertebral body compression is seen.
 
 Similar as on the preceding examination, a right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter
 with subclavian approach is identified, seen to terminate in the lower SVC. 
 Mildly gas-distended large bowel loop under left-sided hemidiaphragm but no
 significant elevation of the left-sided hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion, or acute infiltrates.
