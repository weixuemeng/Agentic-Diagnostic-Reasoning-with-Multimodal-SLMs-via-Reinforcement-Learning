                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:01 p.m.
 
 Compared to the earlier film, the position of the battery pack for the
 pacemaker has changed, now lying slightly closer to the midline and in a more
 horizontal orientation.  Background COPD is unchanged.  Cardiac contour
 appears to be larger and there is suggestion of new small effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Opacity of the right base is
 probably essentially unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 vascular plethora, similar to the prior film.  Degree of opacity at the left
 base appears to have increased in the interim.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Apparent interval increase in the degree of cardiomegaly. 
 
 2.  Suspect background COPD. Enlarged pulmonary arteries are consistent with
 pulmonary hypertension.  
 
 3.  New bilateral effusions with worsening underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Previously seen right base opacity is not as well seen, but is
 probably unchanged.
 
 4.  Mild vascular plethora is grossly unchanged.
 
 5.  Change in position of the pacemaker, please see comment above.
