 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient admitted for CHF
 exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer
 device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, unchanged in
 position.  Heart size remains enlarged, unchanged.  There is improvement of
 diffuse bilateral opacities, suggestive of improved mild pulmonary edema. 
 More focal opacity in the lower right lung is likely atelectasis. Bilateral
 pleural effusions are persistent, increased on the right and unchanged on the
 left.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improvement of mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the right and
 unchanged on the left.
