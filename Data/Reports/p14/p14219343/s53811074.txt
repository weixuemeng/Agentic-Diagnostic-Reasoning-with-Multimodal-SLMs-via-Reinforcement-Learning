                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF  // Eval for CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided chest wall pacer is noted with leads overlying the right atrium
 and ventricle, unchanged in their position.  The cardiac size is difficult to
 approximate, but appears persistently enlarged.  Interval increase in the
 degree of now moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Streaky bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection is difficult to
 exclude.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are noted, increased
 bilaterally from the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent cardiomegaly with worsening of now moderate to severe pulmonary
 edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
