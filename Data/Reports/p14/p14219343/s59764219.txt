                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and crackles.  Known congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a moderate
 interstitial abnormality consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is asymmetric
 dense right perihilar opacification.  This may be due to pulmonary edema
 superimposed on prominent background bronchovascular opacities in the area,
 but developing pneumonia is not excluded at this site.  Short-term followup
 radiographs are suggested.
