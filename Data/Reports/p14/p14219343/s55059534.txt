                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF and admission for severe sepsis.  //
 Evaluate for worsening effusions, pneumonia      Evaluate for worsening
 effusions, pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___, there is little interval change.  Again
 there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with only mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion in the full inspiration view.  Again there are bilateral
 pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The dual-channel
 pacer device is again seen with leads in the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle.
 Again there is no definite superimposed pneumonia, though this would be
 difficult to completely exclude, especially in the retrocardiac region, in the
 absence of a lateral view.
