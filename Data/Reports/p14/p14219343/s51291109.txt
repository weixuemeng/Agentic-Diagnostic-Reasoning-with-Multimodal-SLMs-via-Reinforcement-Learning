 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:11 AM
  Increased interstitial lung markings and more severe bilateral pulmonary
  alveolar opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema and worsening heart
  failure.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:17 AM
  Increased interstitial lung markings and more severe bilateral pulmonary
  alveolar opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema.  Dense right perihilar
  opacity is similar in appearance since ___, but superimposed infection
  in this region is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with h/o CHF, with dypsnea, hypoxia.  Assess for pulmonary
 edema, effusion, infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, increased interstitial lung markings and
 more severe bilateral pulmonary alveolar opacities, with persistent
 cardiomegaly, are consistent with pulmonary edema.  Asymmetric dense right
 perihilar opacity similar in appearance since ___, likely due to
 asymmetrical edema, although superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions with compressive bibasilar atelectasis is
 unchanged.  Left-sided pacemaker device identified with leads in unchanged
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial lung markings and more severe bilateral pulmonary
 alveolar opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema.
