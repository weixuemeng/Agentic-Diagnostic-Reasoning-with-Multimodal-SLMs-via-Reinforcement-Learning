                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates stable severe
 cardiomegaly with interval increase in perihilar opacifications consistent
 with increased pulmonary edema.  Slightly more focal opacification projecting
 over the right mid lung may reflect superimposed infection.  Small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis present.  Slightly
 increased collapse of the right middle lobe compared to next preceding study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary edema and bilateral
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions.  Cannot exclude additional superimposed
 infection, particularly in right mid lung. Recommend re-imaging after
 diuresis.  Slight interval increase in collapse of right middle lobe.
