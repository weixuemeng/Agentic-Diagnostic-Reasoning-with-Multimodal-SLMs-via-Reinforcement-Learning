                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough and dyspnea. // Please
 eval for progression of R atelectasis vs. infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Again
 seen is an opacity in the right lower lung, which is similar to slightly
 improved from the prior study, and likely represents a combination of pleural
 effusion and pneumonia. Increased opacification at the left base is also
 concerning for pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities are concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2. Mild stable pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Large right pleural effusion.
