                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress. Evaluate for infiltration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker is noted with leads in the standard position.
 
 There are bilateral basilar opacities, likely combination of small pleural
 effusions and atelectasis. Superimposed infection would be difficult to
 exclude. There is mild pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably enlarged but
 difficult to fully assess given the parenchymal abnormalities. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions.
