                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and apparent worsening of an asymmetrical pattern of
 pulmonary edema, now involving the left lung to a greater degree than the
 right.  Other superimposed process such as aspiration or developing infectious
 pneumonia is also possible, and followup radiographs after diuresis may be
 helpful in this regard.  Moderate layering left pleural effusion appears more
 prominent than on the prior study but positional differences could potentially
 contribute to this apparent change.  Focal opacity adjacent to the right minor
 fissure may reflect a combination of intrafissural fluid and adjacent
 atelectasis.
