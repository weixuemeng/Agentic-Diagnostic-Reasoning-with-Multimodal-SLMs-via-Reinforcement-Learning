                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sob s/p head wound and resultant anemia  //
 R/O pulm infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Level scoliosis of the mediastinum contributes to the
 tortuosity of the aorta.
 
 Assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild hyperinflation. Opacities
 projecting over the lungs bilaterally most likely corresponds to partially
 imaged pleural plaques on prior CT abdomen containing calcifications. The
 right upper lobe linear opacities, most likely reflecting area of scarring can
 be seen on the prior studies but currently a more pronounced. Also there is
 questionable increase in opacification of the right apex does interval
 development of scarring or (less likely) neoplasm cannot be excluded and
 correlation with chest CT is recommended. There is no pleural effusion and
 there is no pneumothorax.
