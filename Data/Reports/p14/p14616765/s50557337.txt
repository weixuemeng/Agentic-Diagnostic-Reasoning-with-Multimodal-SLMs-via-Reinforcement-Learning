                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and chills. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and ___.  CT spine from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral pleural plaques and irregular, densely calcified pleural
 calcifications in the left lung, consistent with prior asbestos exposure, are
 unchanged.  Right upper lobe opacity with right hilar elevation and linear
 arrays of bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis is worse since ___, and is perhaps due to post-radiation fibrosis.  However, correlation for
 history of tuberculosis is warranted.
 
 Heart size is normal. The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattened diaphragms,
 due to emphysema. Due to the preexisting pleural plaques and previously
 demonstrated breast artifacts, it is difficult to discern if there is a focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia in the mid lung fields.  No pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Pre-existing pleural plaques and breast tissue artifacts makes it
 difficult to discern a focal consolidation/pneumonia in the mid lung fields. 
 Routine oblique views are requested for clarification.
 
 2.  Worsened right upper lobe scarring with right hilar elevation and
 bronchial wall thickening/bronchiectasis may be due to postradiation fibrosis,
 if there is a corresponding history. Alternatively, close correlation history
 of tuberculosis is warranted.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The ordering clinician Dr. ___ could not be reached by
 pager or via the listed telephone numbers ___ or ___. 
 Therefore, these findings and recommendations were entered into the imaging
 findings dashboard for communication to this clinician at 16:38 on ___.  A voicemail message was also left at the first phone number
 listed above.
 
 Update:  Dr. ___ ___ back at 17:17 and these findings and recommendations
 were communicated at this time.
