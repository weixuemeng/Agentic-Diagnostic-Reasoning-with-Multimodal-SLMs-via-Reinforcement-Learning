                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSCLC. Reports persistent new cough  //
 Eval etiology cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 By report, the the patient is status post left upper resection. Compared with
 the prior film, the Port-A-Cath type catheter is no longer visualized. Overall
 appearances are similar, with bilateral effusions; left apical pleural
 thickening, left hilar retraction, can tenting along the left hemidiaphragm;
 and pleural thickening and/or fluid at the left base laterally. Also again
 seen is patchy opacity at the right base, with pleural thickening along the
 right chest wall.
 
 The opacity at the right base may be slightly more pronounced on the current
 study. Otherwise, no gross change is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible increased opacity the right base, though the appearance is relatively
 similar to the ___ radiograph. In this setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude a superimposed opacity, but no new area of involvement is
 detected.
