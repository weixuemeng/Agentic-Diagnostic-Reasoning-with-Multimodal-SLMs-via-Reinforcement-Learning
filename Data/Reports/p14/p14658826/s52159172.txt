                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic NSCLC and worsened hypoxia,
 eval for increase in effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 Peaking of the right hemidiaphragm is of uncertain etiology and may represent
 a small right pleural effusion. There is no substantial change in the lung
