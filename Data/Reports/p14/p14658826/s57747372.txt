                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and history of lung cancer status
 post resection and a history of lymphoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___
 and ___.  Study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left pleural effusion which obscures the left
 heart border and left lung base.  Underlying atelectasis or infectious process
 cannot be ruled out.  Scarring is noted adjacent to the left mediastinal
 border and there is upward retraction of the left hilus consistent with a
 history of left upper lobectomy and can also be a function of radiation
 change.  There is no new focal consolidation, pneumothorax or significant
 pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Left pleural effusion and left paramediastinal scarring could be
 secondary to radiation changes.  Underlying atelectasis or infectious process
 cannot be ruled out.
