                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer
 and new hypoxia.  Evaluate for pleural effusion, worsening parenchymal
 disease, or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate persistent massive
 diffuse bilateral micronodular pattern in both lungs, not significantly
 changed from the prior study.  Again seen is scarring or atelectasis along the
 medial aspect of the left lung, likely representing prior radiation.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is a tiny left
 pleural effusion.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the right atrium.  There
 is no pneumothorax or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of massive diffuse bilateral micronodular
 pattern in both lungs which is concerning for metastatic disease.  No
 pneumonia. Recommend CT of the chest for additional evaluation of symptoms
 persist.
