                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ study.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of right Pleurx catheter in the lower right
 hemithorax, and removal of a right-sided chest tube.  No visible pneumothorax.
 Small right pleural effusion appears similar to the prior study. 
 Circumferential left pleural thickening and/or effusion also appear similar as
 well as post-operative alterations in the left hemithorax.  Widespread
 micronodular and reticular opacities are consistent with diffuse neoplastic
 disease and appear similar.  A more confluent opacity in the right middle lobe
 has worsened and could potentially be due to an evolving infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
