                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with port and pain at port/shoulder  // eval
 for position of port      eval for position of port
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, read in conjunction with chest
 CT on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has had left upper lung resection. Extensive, circumferential, left
 pleural thickening is chronic and micro nodulation, due to tumor
 dissemination, is long-standing as well. Small right pleural effusion has
 decreased. Likely region of previous pneumonia in the superior segment of one
 of the lower lobes has resolved, and another region of likely pneumonia in the
 lingula has improved. Right middle lobe is chronically consolidated, and
 obscures the heart border of the border of the heart which is probably not
 much enlarged.
 
 Right transjugular infusion port catheter ends in the right atrium. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Detection of any chest wall infection or bleeding associated with the port
 would require CT scanning or, perhaps, localized ultrasound.
