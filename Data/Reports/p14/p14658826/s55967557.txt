                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a transbronchial biopsy on the right,
 complicated by pneumothorax, now with right pleural catheter in place.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right pleural pigtail
 catheter with essentially complete resolution of the previously described
 pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low, but opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic angle may represent hemorrhage from recent biopsy of the right
 lower lobe.  Scarring/atelectasis is present along the medial aspect of the
 left lung, possibly representing prior radiation.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post right pleural catheter, with essentially complete
 resolution of pneumothorax.
