                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate effusion and pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is
 unchanged.  Multiple tiny lung nodules in the right lung are again noted. 
 Left apical chest tube remains in place.  Left chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema has improved.
