                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion and lung cancer,
 evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with the next previous available chest
 examination of ___.  PA and lateral chest views have been
 obtained with patient in upright position.
 
 Comparision with findings on the single frontal view examination of ___
 demonstrates that the chest tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  One still can observe some local chest wall emphysema residual
 along the left chest wall.  The amount of pleural density blunting the lateral
 posterior pleural sinus is of moderate degree.  Underlying pulmonary
 parenchymal densities in the left lower lobe are obscured and cannot be
 evaluated.  Deformity described that involves the left hilar area appears
 unchanged.  Right hemithorax is grossly unremarkable and suspicion for
 existence of small nodular densities in the right lung has been evaluated on
 previous chest CT.
