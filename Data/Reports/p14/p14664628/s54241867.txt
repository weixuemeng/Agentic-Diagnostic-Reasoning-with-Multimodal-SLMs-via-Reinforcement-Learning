                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration. 
 The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests perhaps a very
 small pleural effusion or atelectasis.  Chain suture material is new since the
 earlier examination along the right upper lung. Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus that may suggest a small
 effusion and post-surgical change in the right upper lung; otherwise
 unremarkable.
