                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Jaundice, multiple liver masses and a sigmoid mass.  Now with fever.
 Evaluate for a pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are exceedingly low, which results
 in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  This also explains the
 appearance of the mediastinum, which is not widened secondary to pericardial
 fluid as validated by the prior CT abdomen and pelvis.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult to assess, however, is likely
 normal.
