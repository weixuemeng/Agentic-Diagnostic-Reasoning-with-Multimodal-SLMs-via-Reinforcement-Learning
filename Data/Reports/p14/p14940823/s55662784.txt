                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive
 improvement with complete resolution of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities
 are resolved, and likely were atelectatic in origin.  Only at the left lung
 base, a discoid atelectasis persists.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 No pleural effusions.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
