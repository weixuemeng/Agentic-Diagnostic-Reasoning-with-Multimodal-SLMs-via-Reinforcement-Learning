                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multifocal pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 4:39.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 5:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in
 position.  There has been some interval improvement in aeration with patchy
 heterogeneous opacities in both lungs being slightly less apparent.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated, of uncertain etiology and significance. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No large effusions or
 pneumothoraces.  Compared to prior studies dating back to ___, there is
 likely no significant interval change given differences in technique,
 positioning and aeration.
