                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 439 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right lobar consolidation or collapse. 
 Evaluate for improvement post-treatment.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 439 is submitted and compared to
 prior study of ___ at 508.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line remain unchanged in
 position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given
 differences in patient rotation.  There are heterogeneous patchy opacities in
 both lower lungs, which do not appear to be significantly changed, and
 therefore favor an infectious process or aspiration rather than atelectasis. 
 No large effusions.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 a pneumothorax is diminished given a semi-supine technique. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
