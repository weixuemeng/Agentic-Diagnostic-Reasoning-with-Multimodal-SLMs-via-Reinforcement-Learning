                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:31
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:37.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 4:31 is submitted and compared to
 prior study of ___ at 15:37.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in
 position.  The left subclavian central line has been removed.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable given portable technique.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  The subtle patchy opacity at the right base and possibly in the
 retrocardiac region is unchanged and would favor atelectasis given the low
 lung volumes.  No effusions.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
