 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no relevant prior
 studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The ET tube tip is 4 cm above
 the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for minimal bibasal atelectasis, but no definitive evidence of
 infection is seen.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
