                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy catheter and
 right approach central venous line are in unchanged expected position. 
 Catheters overlie the midline upper abdomen.  Small consolidation within the
 right lower lobe is unchanged.  Increasing retrocardiac density is likely due
 to new atelectasis.   No overt interstitial edema is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to prior, allowing for
 differences in patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 2.  Unchanged small right basilar opacity.
 3.  No overt edema.
