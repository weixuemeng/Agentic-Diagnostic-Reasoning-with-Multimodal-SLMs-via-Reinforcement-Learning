                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of intubation at
 outside hospital, evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 4.9 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen, terminating in the distal
 esophagus, and should be advanced so that it is well within the stomach.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  There is a subacute old left posterior rib fracture.
 Subtle opacity projecting over this at this level most likely relates to
 fracture/bone changes.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Right paratracheal calcification
 may represent a calcified lymph node.  There are old right humeral fracture
 and posttraumatic and congenital deformity at the right shoulder with possible
 loose bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Nasogastric tube high in position, terminating in the distal esophagus. 
 Recommend advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
 3.  Hyperinflated but clear lungs.
 4.  Subacute-to-old left ninth rib fracture with opacity projecting over it,
 which is felt to more likely be related to osseous change.  Recommend
 comparison with priors and if the opacity has increased, consider chest CT to
 evaluate for underlying pulmonary nodule.
 5.  Old fracture deformity and severe degenerative change at the right
 shoulder with possible loose body.
 
 The above findings and recommendation under #2 were discussed with Dr. ___
 ___ at 6:12 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
