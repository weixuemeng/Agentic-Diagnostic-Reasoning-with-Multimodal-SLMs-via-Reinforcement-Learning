                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, congestive heart failure, please evaluate
 for pulmonary edema, occult pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is is demonstrated with leads
 terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is similar compared to the previous exam.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Previously noted vascular
 congestion has essentially resolved with no pulmonary edema noted.  Patchy and
 linear opacities in the lung bases bilaterally likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence for pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar
 atelectasis.
