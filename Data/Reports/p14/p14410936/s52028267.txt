                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with headache, SLE and RLE weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, PET-CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 at the aortic knob.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Calcified nodule in the left upper
 lobe and calcified left hilar lymph nodes are compatible prior granulomas
 disease.  Right lower lobe mass appears grossly unchanged compared to the most
 recent PET-CT from ___.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Previously described ground-glass opacity in
 the right lower lobe and nodule in the left upper lobe seen on PET-CT are not
 well visualized on the current radiograph.  Hypertrophic changes are again
 seen in the thoracic spine.  Gastric lap band is in similar position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Grossly similar appearance of right lower lobe mass.  No new focal
 consolidation.
