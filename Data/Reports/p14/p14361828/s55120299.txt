                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Increased interstitial markings with likely
 bronchiectasis are most pronounced within the left lung base, progressed when
 compared to the prior chest radiograph, but seen on the prior CT. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is otherwise demonstrated. No
 acute osseous abnormalities detected.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial abnormality at the left lung base likely reflects
 chronic fibrotic change with bronchiectasis, better seen on the prior CT, but
 progressed when compared to the prior chest radiograph.  No focal
 consolidation suggestive of pneumonia is identified.
