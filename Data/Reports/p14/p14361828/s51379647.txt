                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening renal failure with history of liver transplant.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral
 opacifications at the bases have effectively cleared.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains at the upper limits of normal in size.  There is continued prominence
 of the left hilar region, though no abnormality was seen in this area on the
 recent CT scan.  The bilateral bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis are much
 better appreciated on CT.
