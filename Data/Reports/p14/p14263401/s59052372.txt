 INDICATION:  ___F with RUQ/Flank pain x 1 week  // eval for effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, effusion or vascular congestion.
 There is abnormality of the cardiomediastinal silhouette within extremely
 tortuous both ascending and descending thoracic aorta.  The aortic knob is
 likely located to the right of the trachea as opposed to its normal position
 on the left. The trachea is significantly displaced laterally the left and
 anteriorly. A component of and thoracic aortic aneurysm or potentially a
 diverticulum of Kommerell is possible.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.  No free air seen below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Extremely tortuous thoracic aorta with
 probable right-sided aortic arch.  Superimposed thoracic aortic aneurysm or
 diverticulum of Kommerell is also possible and dedicated chest CT is
 suggested.
