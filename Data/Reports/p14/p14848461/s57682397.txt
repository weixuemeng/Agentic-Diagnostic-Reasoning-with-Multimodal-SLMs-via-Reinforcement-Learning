                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of melanoma with new effusion.
 Followup hydro pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from 2 days prior and chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pleural catheter projects over the left lung base. There is diffuse
 opacification of the left lung, a combination of tumor and consolidation.  The
 hydro pneumothorax is minimal, at the left apex.  Nodules in the right lung
 mild partially demonstrated, better evaluated on the recent chest CT.  No
 right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse opacification of the right lung, combination of tumor and
 consolidation.  Right hydropneumothorax is very small by CT, barely
 appreciable by radiography, and likely secondary to catheter placement thus
 followup by radiography is of doubtful utility.
