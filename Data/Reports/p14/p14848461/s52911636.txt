                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea and h/o melanoma found to have pleural effusion
 // eval for interval change s/p left thoracic pigtail placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been interval placement of a left base chest
 tube.  Degree of opacification of the left hemi thorax has decreased with some
 aeration in the left lung although multi focal nodular densities are
 suspicious for underlying nodules and regions of persistent
 atelectasis/consolidation.  Although not definitive, there is suspected left
 apical pneumothorax medially.  Right lung pulmonary nodules as seen on
 previous exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided pigtail catheter with improved aeration in
 the left lung but persistent diffuse opacity.  Suspected but not definitive
 left apical pneumothorax.
