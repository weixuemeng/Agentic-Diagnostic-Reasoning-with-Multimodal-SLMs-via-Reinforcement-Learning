                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new L pleural effusion, sm hydropneumothorax
 // f/u post chest tube removal
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior study of earlier the same date, left pigtail pleural
 catheter is been removed.  Loculated hydro pneumothorax at the left apex has
 increased in size.  Partially loculated left pleural effusion has decreased in
 size with associated improved aeration of the left lung base.  Widespread
 pulmonary, intrathoracic lymph node, and left-sided pleural metastases appear
 similar.
