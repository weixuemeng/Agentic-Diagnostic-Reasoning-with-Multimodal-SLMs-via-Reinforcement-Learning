 INDICATION:  Pulmonary fibrosis, incarcerated inguinal hernia, preoperative
 chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.

 subpleural reticulations, consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, no pleural effusions.  No evidence of acute lung disease
 overlaying the fibrotic changes.
