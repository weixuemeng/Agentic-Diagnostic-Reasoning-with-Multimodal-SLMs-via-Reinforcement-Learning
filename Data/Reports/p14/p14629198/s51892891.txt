 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are slightly low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for lung
 volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
