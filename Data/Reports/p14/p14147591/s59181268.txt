                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough  // cough
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, the heart has increased in size, accompanied by azygos vein
 distension in increase caliber of upper lobe vessels.  Within this context,
 new basilar predominant interstitial opacities likely represent interstitial
 edema.  Additionally, asymmetrically distributed multifocal areas of
 consolidation have developed predominantly in the juxta hilar regions, right
 greater than left, with extension into the upper lobe on the right.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for healed left rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema.  Asymmetrically distributed
 perihilar alveolar opacities, right greater than left, could reflect
 asymmetrical edema or coexisting infectious pneumonia.  If the diagnosis is in
 doubt clinically, followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful.
