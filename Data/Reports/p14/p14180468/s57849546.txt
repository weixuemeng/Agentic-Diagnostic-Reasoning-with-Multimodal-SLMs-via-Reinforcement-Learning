                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest tube to waterseal.  Evaluate change in
 small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Today's study shows no change in size in the small right
 pneumothorax compared to yesterday's 13:50 study.  Hazy opacities at the right
 lung base adjacent to rib fractures may represent contusion or atelectasis. 
 Positioning of right-sided chest tube appears unchanged.  The left lung
 remains clear.
