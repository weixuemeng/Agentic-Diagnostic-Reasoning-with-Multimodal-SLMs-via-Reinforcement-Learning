                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known lung cancer with brain metastasis,
 now with new onset thrombocytopenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA of the chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Again seen is consolidation within the
 lingular segment of the left lung, which allowing for differences in technique
 is unchanged since the prior study.  No new consolidation is detected in the
 study.  The subtle ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes seen in the
 prior CT, are too subtle to be appreciated on the chest radiograph.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the lingular segment of the left lung, is
 consistent with known diagnosis of lung cancer.  No new pulmonary pathology
 identified.
