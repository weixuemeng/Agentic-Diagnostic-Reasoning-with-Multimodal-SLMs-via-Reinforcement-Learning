                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and a CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, lung cancer, dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is stable
 consolidation in the left upper lobe and lingula compatible with known lung
 malignancy.  There is increased opacity in the left lower lobe best seen on
 the lateral projection which could represent a superimposed pneumonia.  No
 definite consolidation on the right.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact with right AC joint separation again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of extensive consolidation in the left upper
 lobe/lingula.  Vague new opacity in the left lower lobe may represent a
 superimposed pneumonia.  Please refer to subsequent CT of the chest for
 further details.
