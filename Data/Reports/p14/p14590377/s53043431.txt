 stable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Known right eighth and
 ninth rib fractures are poorly assessed on this AP view due to soft tissue
 attenuation, however no new displaced rib fractures are identified within
 these limitations.

 No pneumothorax or other acute cardiopulmonary pathology.  Moderate hiatal
 hernia. No new displaced rib fracture identified. Known right eighth and ninth
