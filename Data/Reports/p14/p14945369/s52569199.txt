                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with low white blood cell count, question
 underlying infectious process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Comparison is made to previous
 exam from ___.  There is small region of left basilar opacity,
 slightly more conspicuous on the current exam.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 of consolidation.  Scattered calcifications are seen in the right lung base
 and in the hilar regions, suggestive of calcified granulomas.  Mitral annular
 calcifications are noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Slightly more
 conspicuous opacity at the left lung base, potentially due to atelectasis. 
 Two view chest xray may offer additional detail.
