                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  There are
 extensive airspace opacities bilaterally with relative sparing of the left
 upper lung ___, which are new since prior study.  The costophrenic angles are
 obscured, suggestive of trace pleural effusions.  Cardiac size is difficult to
 discern due to adjacent pleural opacities, which is likely mildly enlarged.
 Right PIC catheter has been removed.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, significantly progressed with minimal
 sparing of the left upper lung ___, ___ represent multifocal infection or
 edema.  Likely trace bilateral pleural effusions.
