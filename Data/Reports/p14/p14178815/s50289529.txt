                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Probable seizure with low oxygen saturations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of
 the superior mediastinum is unchanged, and appears attributable to the
 presence of mediastinal fat as seen on the prior CT.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 likely present.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity
 persists, and could reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot
 be excluded.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small left pleural
 effusion with persistent left basilar opacity, which could reflect atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration is not excluded.
