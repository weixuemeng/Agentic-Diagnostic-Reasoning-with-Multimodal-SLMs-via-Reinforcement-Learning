                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and low oxygen saturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Per the radiology
 technologist, the patient would not follow commands, could not control head
 motion, best possible images.
 
 Left lower lung opacity is similar in appearance and again may reflect
 combination of atelectasis with possible pleural effusion, although aspiration
 or infection cannot be excluded on this study.  There is slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion on the right may be
 present.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Persistent left base opacity
 could represent a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, however,
 consolidation due to aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  Possible
 trace right pleural effusion.
