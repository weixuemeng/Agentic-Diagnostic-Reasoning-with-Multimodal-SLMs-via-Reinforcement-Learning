                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, bronchiectasis with episodes of fatigue and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph is ___, ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lucency in
 the upper lung zones, right more than left, is compatible with severe
 emphysema.  Linear opacities in the lower lungs are likely due to compression
 of vessels with areas of linear scarring and a bandlike scar in the right
 middle lobe, similar to the prior CT.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Median sternotomy
 wires are intact after CABG.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.  Severe emphysema is similar to
 ___.
