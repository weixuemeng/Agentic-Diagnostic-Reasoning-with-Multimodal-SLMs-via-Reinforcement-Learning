                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased dyspnea on exertion, ___ edema.
 Known severe COPD + CAD + A Fib  // eval for change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared chest radiographs from ___, heart size has increased, now
 mildly enlarged, and there is a new small right pleural effusion.  No
 appreciable effusion on the left.  Lungs are hyperinflated with vascular
 deficiency in the upper lobes, consistent with severe emphysema. There is mild
 central vascular congestion with indistinct vascular margins in the lower
 lobes, right greater than left, suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema,
 though superimposed area of heterogeneous opacification in this area, which
 could reflect pneumonia, cannot be definitively excluded.  Nonspecific
 bibasilar scarring, right greater than left, persists .  No pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Median sternotomy wires are intact
 with mediastinal clips noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New mild cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion.
 2. Mild central vascular congestion with indistinct vascular margins in the
 lower lobes, right greater than left, could represent lower lobe predominant
 CHF in the setting of severe emphysema.  A more confluent opacity in the right
 infrahilar region could reflect asymmetrical edema or infectious
 consolidation.  Follow-up chest radiograph following treatment for CHF is
 recommended to exclude superimposed infection.
 3. Severe emphysema.
 4. Persistent nonspecific basilar scarring.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest radiographs following treatment for CHF to
 exclude superimposed infection in the right lower lung.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 15:08 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
