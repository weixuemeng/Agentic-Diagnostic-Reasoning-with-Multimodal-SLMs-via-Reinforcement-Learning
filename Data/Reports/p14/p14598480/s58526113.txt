                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of worsening
 cough/anorexia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  There is a hiatal hernia with air-fluid level
 seen, best seen on the lateral view.  A patchy right mid lung opacity is seen.
 There is also posterior left base opacity which could represent atelectasis. 
 A new left upper lung opacification is also seen.  Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess, but is likely borderline to mildly enlarged.  There is
 blunting of bilateral posterior costophrenic angles which could be due to
 trace effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right mid lung and left upper lobe opacities raise concern for multifocal
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Posterior left lower lobe
 opacity may be atelectasis, although an additional focus of consolidation not
 excluded.
 2.  Hiatal hernia.
