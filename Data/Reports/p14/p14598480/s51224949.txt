                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a history of CHF, pneumonia, now with
 increasing confusion and lethargy.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are not widened.  Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the medial left
 hemidiaphragm with also areas of relative retrocardiac lucency may be from
 previously seen hiatal hernia.  The sternotomy wires are unchanged.  The lungs
 show improved but continued bibasilar and right upper lung airspace opacities.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved but persistent multifocal opacities likely representing
 multifocal pneumonia - recommend follow-up imaging after treatment to ensure
 resolution.
 
 Hiatal hernia.
