                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent pneumonia and CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since
 ___, there is increased opacity in the right upper lobe with bilateral
 perihilar opacities.  The right lower lobe and retrocardiac opacities are
 similar, due large pleural effusions and atelectasis seen on subsequent CT
 abdomen. The pleural effusions are larger than on the prior study. Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes with cardiac enlargement are stable. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with congestive heart failure.  A right upper
 lobe opacity is new and is probably infection.  Recommend repeat radiograph
 after treatment.
