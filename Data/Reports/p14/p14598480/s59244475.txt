                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fluid overload.  Please evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous exam
 from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been interval
 worsening of the appearance of the lungs, more so on the right than on the
 left.  There is persistent right upper lobe and now new right lower lobe
 opacities.  Indistinct vascular markings are seen throughout as well.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are also seen in addition to a large retrocardiac
 hiatal hernia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of disease in the lungs, more notably on the
 right than on the left.  Findings may represent bilateral infection; however,
 pulmonary edema can have the same appearance.  Clinical correlation suggested
 and repeat after treatment to document resolution.
