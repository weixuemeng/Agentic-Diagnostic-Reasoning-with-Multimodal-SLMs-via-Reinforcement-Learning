                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is again either a large hiatal hernia with
 an air-fluid level projecting over the lower chest to the left of midline. 
 There is a mild background interstitial abnormality with indistinct
 vasculature suggestive of pulmonary congestion.  However, new patchy opacities
 in the right upper and the lower lobes are relatively focal in distribution,
 in addition to persistent left basilar and lingular opacities.  Anterior
 flowing syndesmophytes are again noted along the thoracic spine.  The bones
 may be demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multifocal pulmonary process.  Some features suggest
 multifocal pneumonia, others vascular congestion.  Correlation with clinical
 factors is recommended.  Both may be present in this patient or alternatively
 an unusual pattern of asymmetric pulmonary edema of diffuse pneumonia could be
 considered as the primary etiology.
