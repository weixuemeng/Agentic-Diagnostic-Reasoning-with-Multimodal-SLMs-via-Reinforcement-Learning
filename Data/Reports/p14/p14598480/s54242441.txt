                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with EF of 20% now with shortness of breath;
 evaluate for pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the most recent prior radiograph, there are now worsening
 focal opacities at the right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm which
 is concerning for infectious process.  Bilateral pleural effusions have
 increased, especially on the right.  There is significant volume loss of the
 right upper lobe as is evidenced by the minor fissure being pulled upward. 
 The previously seen right upper lobe opacity is no longer identified and was
 likely atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New focal opacities at the right base which are concerning for
 infectious process.  Worsening bilateral pleural effusions, particularly on
 the right.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 10:30 a.m.
