                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Orthopnea with cough, history of congestive heart failure, and
 pneumonia.  Crackles at the bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CT torso, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median
 sternotomy, CABG, and vascular stenting.  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal contour is unchanged with mild aortic tortuosity.  Again noted is
 a large left hiatal hernia, with associated opacity in the left lung base
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Ill-defined patchy opacities within the right lung base and both mid
 lung fields appear more pronounced when compared to the prior study, and may
 reflect areas of developing infection, or possibly asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 No pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy ill-defined opacities within the mid lung fields bilaterally and
 right lung base, which could represent areas of infection or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  Large hiatal hernia with adjacent left basilar opacity likely reflecting
 atelectasis.
