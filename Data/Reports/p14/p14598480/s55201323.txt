                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia diagnosed on ___ and
 known CAD and atrial fibrillation.  Assess for resolution/progression of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Previously seen right mid lung and
 left upper lobe opacities have resolved.  However, there is residual opacity
 of the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.  A large hiatal hernia is
 present with adjacent left basilar atelectasis.  Mediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Midline sternotomy wires remain intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Although there has been resolution of right mid and left upper
 lobe opacities, there is residual opacity of the posterior segment of the left
 lower lobe for which follow up chest x-ray in 4 weeks is recommended to ensure
 complete resolution.  Large hiatal hernia.
