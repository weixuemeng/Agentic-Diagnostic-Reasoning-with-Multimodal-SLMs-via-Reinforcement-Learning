                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // eval pneumonia other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ single-view chest; chest CT of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There diffuse bilateral opacities and prominence of the interstitial markings.
 Some areas of more patchy opacity are noted at the left base.  No pleural
 effusion or septal lines.  Heart size is within normal limits.  No mediastinal
 masses are appreciated.  There is degenerative change of the thoracic spine. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 pulmonary edema could cause a similar appearance but is felt less likely given
 lack of pleural effusions.  Followup radiography after treatment is required
 to ensure resolution of these findings.
