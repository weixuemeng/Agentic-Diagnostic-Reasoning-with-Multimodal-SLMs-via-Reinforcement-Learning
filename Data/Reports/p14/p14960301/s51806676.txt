  Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities which compared to prior may have
  progressed.  While infection with multifocal or atypical pneumonia is
  possible, differential is broad and also includes edema or other interstitial
  process.  If findings do not clear on followup after treatment, CT scan will
  be necessary to further assess.

 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities are again
 seen although greater on the left than on the right, they have slightly
 progressed on the right when compared to prior.  Despite low lung volumes,
 there is also apparent progression based on the lateral view. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Osseous structures demonstrate no
 acute abnormality, chronic appearing right lateral rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities which compared to prior may have
 progressed.  While infection with multifocal or atypical pneumonia is
 possible, differential is broad and also includes edema or other interstitial
 process.  If findings do not clear on followup after treatment, CT scan will
 be necessary to further assess.
