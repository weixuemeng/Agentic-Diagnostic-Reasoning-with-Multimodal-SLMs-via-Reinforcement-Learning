                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary edema from
 fluid resuscitation, follow up.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is still present mild interstitial edema, although improved since the
 prior study.  The bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis are
 unchanged.  Overall, the study is extremely limited due to patient's position
 and rotation.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Right PICC line tip is not
 definitively seen, most likely terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction.
