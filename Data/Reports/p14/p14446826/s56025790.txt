                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a nasogastric tube that extends well into the stomach.  The study
 is somewhat compromised due to scattered radiation related to the size of the
 patient.  However, there is no appreciable change from the previous study.
