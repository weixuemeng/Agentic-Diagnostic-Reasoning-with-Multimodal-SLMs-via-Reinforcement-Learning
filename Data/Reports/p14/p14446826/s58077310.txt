                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  2:___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with worsening mental status, no clear
 etiology, infection ?.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  Again marked cardiomegaly is identified and
 rather advanced dens calcifications occupy the mitral ring area.  The latter
 finding matches the previous torso CT identified cardiac changes which
 included marked enlargement of the left atrium.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 somewhat congested, but not significantly more than it was on the preceding
 study.  The same holds for the hazy density on the lung bases and particularly
 on the left side over the whole hemithorax compatible with pleural effusions
 layering the posterior pleural spaces as the patient is placed supine.  No
 significant interval change can be identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings over the latest two days' examination
 interval.  The patient had now more than ___ chest examinations over the last
 period, none of which included a lateral view.  The lateral might be useful to
 document truly the amount of pleural effusion that might have accumulated
 posteriorly.  Previously described right-sided PICC line appears unchanged,
 although it is very difficult to identify on this portable chest examination.
