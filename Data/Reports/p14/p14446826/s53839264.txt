                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:43 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Congestion, question fluid repletion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved but large left and moderate right pleural
 effusions and severe bibasilar atelectasis have not.  Heart is severely
 enlarged, perhaps due to mitral regurgitation from a heavily calcified mitral
 annulus.  A right PIC line probably ends in the mid SVC as before but is
 difficult to see.  No pneumothorax.
