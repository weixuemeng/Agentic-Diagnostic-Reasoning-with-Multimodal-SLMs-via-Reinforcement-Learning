                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral interstitial opacities, most
 pronounced in the periphery of the mid and lower lungs.  Additionally, there
 are more confluent poorly defined opacities in the left upper and left lower
 lobes. The left upper lobe opacities have a nodular configuration.  Small
 pleural effusions are present bilaterally.  Lung volumes are increased
 suggesting underlying COPD, and there is a probable small calcified granuloma
 at the right apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Poorly defined consolidation in left upper and left lower lobes concerning
 for multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend followup chest x-ray in four weeks after
 completion of antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution and exclude neoplasm,
 especially since the left upper lobe opacities have a nodular configuration.
 
 2.  Suspected co-existing interstitial edema may also be re-assessed on
 followup chest radiograph.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with likely component of co-existing
 pleural thickening on the left.
