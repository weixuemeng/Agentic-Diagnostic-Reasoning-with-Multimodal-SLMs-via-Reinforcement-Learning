                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Patient with worsening cough/pain in flanks
 for the last 2 days.  // rule out acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the ___ chest radiograph, the heart has slightly increased in
 size and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse
 interstitial edema. There is no definite pneumonia, but followup PA and
 lateral chest radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to a more fully
 exclude this possibility, particularly at the right lung base. Lung volumes
 are increased, suggestive of COPD. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. CHF with interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2. Followup PA and lateral radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to
 exclude the possibility of coexisting pneumonia in the right lung base.
