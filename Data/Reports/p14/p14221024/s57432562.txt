                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  Patchy calcification is
 noted along the aortic arch.  The descending aortic contour is mildly
 tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 peribronchial thickening particularly in the perihilar regions of each lung,
 but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Areas of peribronchial cuffing which suggest an inflammatory or
 perhaps infectious process of lower airways, although there is no definite
 focal consolidation.
