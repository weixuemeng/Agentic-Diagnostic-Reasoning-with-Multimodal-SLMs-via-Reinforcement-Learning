                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recurrent cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are substantially
 hyperinflated with reticular interstitial opacities that most likely related
 to COPD.  Apical scarring, right more than left, appears to be similar to the
 prior study, although somewhat increased at the aspect projecting at the
 intersection of the anterior portion of the first rib and the clavicle.  Given
 the history of COPD and recent cough, reassessment with chest CT might be
 considered to exclude the remote possibility of growing right apical pulmonary
 nodule.
