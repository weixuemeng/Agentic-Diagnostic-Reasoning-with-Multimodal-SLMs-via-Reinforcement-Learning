                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup stent placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. There is a new stent within
 the distal aspect of left mainstem bronchus.  The distal trachea and carina
 are displaced toward the right due to a large esophageal mass, better
 evaluated on the prior CT from ___.  The lungs are clear. There are
 no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New stent in the distal aspect of the left mainstem bronchus. Conventional,
 rather than portable, radiographs would be better suited for any additional
 stent location followup.
