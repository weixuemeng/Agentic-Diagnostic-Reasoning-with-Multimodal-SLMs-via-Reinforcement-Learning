                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer, cough, fever and chills, question aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:20 p.m., with targeted review of
 the chest CT from ___ at 12:00 noon.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip at distalmost SVC, near SVC/RA
 junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the aorta.  The
 patient's known esophageal mass is not well depicted radiographically.  A left
 main stem bronchus stent is present.  There is no CHF.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the right base medially and in the retrocardiac region, with
 some focal patchy opacity in the lower lobe posteriorly, ? left lower lobe. 
 This could correspond to the area of opacity seen on the ___ CT scan.  No
 CHF.  No other focal opacities are identified.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Compared with ___, the patchy opacity at the right base is new and the
 possibility of aspiration in this location cannot be entirely excluded.  
 
 2.  The retrocardiac opacities are grossly unchanged.
