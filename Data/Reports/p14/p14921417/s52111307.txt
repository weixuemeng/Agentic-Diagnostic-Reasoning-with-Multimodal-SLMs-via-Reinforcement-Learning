                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are low, but no focal pulmonary abnormality is seen.  This
 exaggerates mild cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vasculature, mediastinal veins and
 pleural surfaces are normal and there is no evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement.  This study does not constitute a reliable assessment of the
 central airways.  Whether there is a lesion at the origin of the left main
 bronchus or whether this is a superimposition of normal structures anterior or
 posterior to the carina is radiographically indeterminate.  Oblique view
 should be obtained in hopes of clarifying this region.
