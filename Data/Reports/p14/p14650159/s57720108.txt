                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Diffuse
 opacification has resolved, but there are new patchy focal opacities in the
 right upper lung suggesting pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion on the
 right. Trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the left versus
 unchanged scarring effacing the left costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the right upper lobe.
