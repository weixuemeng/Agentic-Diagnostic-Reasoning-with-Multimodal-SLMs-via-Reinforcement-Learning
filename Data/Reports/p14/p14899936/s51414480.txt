 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is right suprahilar opacity which may represent vascular structures
 although is more dense as compared to the left and is worrisome for underlying
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild right suprahilar opacity could represent pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
