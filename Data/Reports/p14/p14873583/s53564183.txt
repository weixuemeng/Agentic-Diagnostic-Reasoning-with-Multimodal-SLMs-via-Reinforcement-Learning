                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Prominence of the right hilum may suggest right pulmonary arterial
 enlargement.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  Eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the lung bases.  Right hilar enlargement could
 suggest a dilated right pulmonary artery.
