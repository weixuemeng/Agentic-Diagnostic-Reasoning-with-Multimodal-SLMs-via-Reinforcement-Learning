                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with diffuse abdominal tenderness and vomiting
 with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays dating back to ___ with
 most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  There are increased reticular markings in the lungs
 bilaterally, similar to priors.  Given stability, these are most suggestive of
 chronic underlying process, either interstitial disease or scarring
 potentially from aspiration.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Multiple old left rib fractures are identified.  Orthopedic screws
 seen in the right humeral head and extensive chronic changes seen at the left
 shoulder.  Compression deformities seen in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar
 spine, not definitely new since prior.  There is no free air below the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  No focal
 consolidations to suggest pneumonia.  Other details as above.
