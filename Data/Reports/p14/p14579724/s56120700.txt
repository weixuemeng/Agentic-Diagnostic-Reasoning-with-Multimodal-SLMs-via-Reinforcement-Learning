                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lung cancer, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  The patient is now extubated.  The previously
 existing shift of the mediastinum towards the right has decreased.  No new
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are noted and the position of the fiducial
 marks appears unchanged.  There is, however, evidence of increasing left-sided
 pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinus is more blunted.  Lateral view
 discloses a triangular-shaped pleural density originating from the right-sided
 minor fissure and extending into the anterior basal portions of the right
 hemithorax.  This density has clearly increased and cannot be evaluated
 further as the previous examination consisted of a single AP view only.  As
 judged from information received during a review of the latest chest CT of
 ___, this large now present atelectasis may be related to the
 previously identified endobronchial lesion obstructing the intermedius
 right-sided bronchus.
