                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increasing
 opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm and
 right heart border.  Substantial increased opacification is seen on lateral
 view.  This suggests some volume loss in the middle lobe with possible
 associated consolidation involving it and the lower lobe.
 
 Left lung and upper right lung is clear.
