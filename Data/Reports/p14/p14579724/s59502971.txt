 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right basal pneumonia
 has decreased in size and extent.  The parenchymal opacity, however, is still
 clearly visible.  Further followup until complete resolution is recommended.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax, no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.
