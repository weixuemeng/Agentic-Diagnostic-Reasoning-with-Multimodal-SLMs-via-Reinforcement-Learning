                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p RLL upper segmentectomy with repeated right
 PTX with pigtail and chest tube in place with ? bronchopleural fistula  //
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube remains low, 2 cm above the carina.  The ETT could be pulled
 back slightly for more optimal placement.  There is unchanged cardiomegaly. 
 There is diffuse subcutaneous emphysema along the chest, stable.  This limits
 evaluation of the lung parenchyma.  Allowing for this, there appears to be
 improved aeration.  There remains a left retrocardiac opacity and small
 bilateral effusions.
