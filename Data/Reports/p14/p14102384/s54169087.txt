                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p RLL segmentectomy // Please assess for
 interval change, PTX or increasing segmental consolidation - Please schedule
 for ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiographs obtained 1 day prior, there is worsening of the
 diffuse right pulmonary opacities . Mild   pulmonary edema in the left lung is
 new.  Allowing for changes in patient positioning, the moderate  right hydro
 pneumothorax, probably loculated at the site of the resected superior segment
 of the lower lobe, is stable and the small to moderate, dependent right
 pleural effusion is stable or minimally larger. Rightward mediastinal shift
 and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall are  unchanged .  Heart
 size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased, diffuse, right lung opacities may reflect new pulmonary edema,
 which is readily apparent in the left lung, or alternatively  developing
 pneumonia.
  Stable, loculated, moderate right hydro pneumothorax and moderate dependent
 pleural effusion.
