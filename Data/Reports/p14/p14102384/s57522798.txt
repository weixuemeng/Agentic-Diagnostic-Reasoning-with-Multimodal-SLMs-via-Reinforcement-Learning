  Right pigtail catheter pleural drain is in stable position.  Right chest tube
  has been partly pulled back now without the previously seen kink.  Right
  pneumothorax appears slightly larger at the apex but smaller at the base. 
  There is significant increase in subcutaneous gas throughout the right chest
  wall concerning for possible air leak.
  
  ET tube is 2.2 cm from the carina.  Right internal jugular catheter and
  enteric tube are in stable position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ pk-yr former smoker with 1.5cm RLL squamous NSCLC now s/p open
 RLL superior segmentectomy s/p pigtail and chest tube placement, now with
 substantial crepitus  // interval pneumothorax evaluation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of earlier the same date, right chest tube and right
 pigtail pleural catheter have apparently been repositioned, and a moderate to
 large right pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size.  Marked subcutaneous
 emphysema in the right chest wall has worsened.  Pulmonary edema has improved.
 No other relevant changes since the recent study.
