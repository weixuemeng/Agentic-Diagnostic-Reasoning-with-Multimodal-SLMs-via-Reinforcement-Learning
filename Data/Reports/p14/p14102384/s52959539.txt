                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F ___ pk-yr former smoker with 1.5cm RLL squamous NSCLC now s/p
 open RLL superior segmentectomy, pigtail now to waterseal  // s/p waterseal
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the previous radiograph from a few hr earlier, a right pleural catheter
 has slightly changed in position, and note is made of substantial decrease in
 size of a previously noted right basilar hydro pneumothorax and accompanying
 re-expansion of the adjacent right lower lobe.  Prominent lucency in the right
 mid lung region likely represents residual loculated pneumothorax in this
 area.  Exam is otherwise similar to the recent radiograph except for worsening
 left retrocardiac opacification.
