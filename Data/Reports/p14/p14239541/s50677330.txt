                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with R posterior rib pain, s/p XRT. Extensive small cell lung
 CA // r/o infiltrate/assess for cancer progression
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left hilar prominence is
 consistent with known left hilar mass. Left perihilar opacity is unchanged
 from recent CT and likely reflects a combination of bronchial thickening and
 tumor. No convincing signs of pneumonia.  No large effusion, pneumothorax or
 definite signs of edema. Cardiac silhouette is stable. Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged. Bony structures appear intact. Dish related changes of the T-spine
 noted. Lungs are hyperinflated and lucent consistent with emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left hilar prominence with perihilar opacity as on recent CT likely reflects
 known tumor and central airway inflammation.
