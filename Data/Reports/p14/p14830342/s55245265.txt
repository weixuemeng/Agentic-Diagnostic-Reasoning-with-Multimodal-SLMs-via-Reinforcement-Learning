                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough and epigastric
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly lower lung volumes,
 with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding. Even allowing for this, the heart is likely mildly enlarged. There
 are diffusely increased interstitial markings, unchanged from prior.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Unchanged cardiomegaly.
 3. Unchanged increased interstitial markings, which can be assessed with
 dedicated CT chest on a nonemergent, outpatient basis as clinically indicated.
