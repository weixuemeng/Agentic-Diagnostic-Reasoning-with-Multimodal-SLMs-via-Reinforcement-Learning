                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A very ill-defined opacity in the left lower lateral lung may either represent
 a prominent part of epicardial fat pad; however, in an appropriate clinical
 setting, this may represent an early pneumonia.  Followup radiograph in three
 to four weeks is recommended to look for interval changes.  Right lung is
 clear.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacity in the left lower lateral lung could be
 either a part of prominent epicardial fat pad; however, in an appropriate
 clinical setting, early lung pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  Followup
 radiograph in three to four weeks is recommended to look for interval changes.
