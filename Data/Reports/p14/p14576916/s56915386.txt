                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  At the left base, there is a patchy infiltrate including fluffy
 nodular elements.  Some of this opacity appears linear at the periphery.  At
 the right base, there is a more subtle opacity.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged, but there is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left than the right worrisome for
 pneumonia or possibly aspiration.  Opacities are partly nodular in character
 so pulmonary nodules including the possibility of malignancy are not excluded.
 If findings are compatible with pneumonia clinically then short-term follow-up
 radiographs are recommended to show complete clearance; otherwise chest CT,
 preferably with contrast if possible, should be considered. 
 
 2.  Findings suggestive of vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
