                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso and chest radiograph of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen traversing
 the esophagus terminating in the stomach.  Diffuse bilateral opacities have
 progressed since prior exam.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with increased bilateral opacities, which likely reflect
 aspiration related to recent intubation.
