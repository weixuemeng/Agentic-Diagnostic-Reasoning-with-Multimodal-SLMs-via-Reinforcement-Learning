 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 which accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.   There is a sable round density
 projecting over right cardiac silhouette.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Round density
 projecting over right cardiac sihouette may represent a prominent right atrium
 or a vascular structure, for which cardiac ECHO is recommended for further
 assessment.
