                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest tube removal in a patient with left apical
 pneumothorax.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 As compared to the prior study, after removal of the chest tube the left
 apical pneumothorax is still present, although decreased.  No interval pleural
 effusion accumulation is noted with only small amount of pleural fluid seen on
 the lateral view.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.
