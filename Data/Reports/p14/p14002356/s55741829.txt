                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx bladder ca, s/p transverse colostomy;
 ureteral stents; r nephrostomy; currently elevated wbc  // looking for source
 of elevated wbc/pulmonary path     looking for source of elevated
 wbc/pulmonary path
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes with prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is obscured with streaks of opacification at the base,
 consistent with pleural fluid volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Right
 hemidiaphragm is sharp with no evidence of effusion.
 Given the changes at the left base and absence of a lateral view, it would be
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
