                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with seizure history presents with difficulty
 swallowing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result and appears
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases,
 more so on the left.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly
 identified.  Marked degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases.  These may reflect
 areas of atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely
 excluded.
