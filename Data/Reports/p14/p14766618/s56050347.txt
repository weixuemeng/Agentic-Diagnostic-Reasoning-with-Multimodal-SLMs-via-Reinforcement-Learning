                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ as well as pre operative
 radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates an oval shaped,
 poorly defined opacity within the right lower lobe, new relative to
 examination dated ___ and ___.  Minor linear atelectasis
 is present at the left lung base.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity within the right lower lobe which could potentially represent a
 early/focal pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after antibiotic therapy are
 recommended to ensure resolution and to exclude the possibility of a lung
 neoplasm.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup chest radiograph in 4 weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution of focal right lower lobe opacity.
