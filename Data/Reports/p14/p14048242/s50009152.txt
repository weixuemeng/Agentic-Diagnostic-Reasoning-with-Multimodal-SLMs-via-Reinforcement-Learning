                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent lower extremity surgery with afib
 with RVR.  // Please evaluate for pneumonia.        Prior x-ray report yields
 a history of CLL, an ICM, septic right prosthetic hip
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An orogastric type tube is again seen, extending beneath the diaphragm off the
 film.  A right-sided PICC line is again seen, tip overlying distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 As before, there is prominent cardiomegaly with slight unfolding of the aorta.
 The overall cardiac silhouette appears slightly smaller, though this could be
 accentuated by differences in technique.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  Considerable interval improvement in previously seen
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No frank consolidation.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal infiltrate or consolidation identified to suggest pneumonia.
