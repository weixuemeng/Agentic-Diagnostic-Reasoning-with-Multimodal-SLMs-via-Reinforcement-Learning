                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // evaluate for pleural effusoin
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects chronic
 pleural thickening, as seen previously.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle likely reflects chronic pleural thickening, without evidence for a
 pleural effusion.
