                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, dilated cardiomyopathy with new onset
 tachyarrhythmia and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is re- demonstrated, better
 seen on the recent CT.  Bilateral hilar enlargement is also compatible with
 underlying lymphadenopathy.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Patchy and linear
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Small right pleural
 effusion persists.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  Small right pleural effusion
 and patchy bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis.
