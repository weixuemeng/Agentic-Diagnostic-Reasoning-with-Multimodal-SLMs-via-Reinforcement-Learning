                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest wall tenderness and dysphagia status post fall, concerning for
 fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are hyperexpanded
 and clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable, with no acute fracture or dislocation seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  No acute fracture or dislocation detected, however conventional chest
 radiographs are not sensitive in detecting chest cage trauma.  If the patient
 has focal findings, bone detail views should be performed of those areas.
