                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval postop changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The sternotomy wires appear intact and appropriately aligned.  There is a
 right IJ with the tip in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 The left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has decreased in size. 
 There is residual effusion on the left, and bibasilar linear opacities
 representing atelectasis.  There is a retrosternal air-fluid level, which is
 likely due to the patient's recent sternotomy.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
 Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ in appropriate positioning.
 2.  Improvement in combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis in the
 lower left hemi thorax.
 3. Retrosternal air-fluid level, likely due to recent sternotomy.
