                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumo      eval for pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ 11:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, mediastinal drains, and nasogastric
 tube.  Right internal jugular central line and left basilar chest tube remain
 in place.  Patchy opacity at the left base with associated effusion likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis in this patient status post median sternotomy
 with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Left
 hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated, possibly related to mild gastric
 distension on the current study.  No pneumothorax identified.
