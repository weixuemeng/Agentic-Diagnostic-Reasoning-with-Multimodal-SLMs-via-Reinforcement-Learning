                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right-sided hemodialysis catheter
 terminates within the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  There has been
 interval removal of a right internal jugular central line.  Linear opacities
 are identified in the lung bases which likely reflect a combination of
 scarring and resolving pulmonary edema given the prior history and
 radiographic findings.  There has been significant improvement in the
 previously described pulmonary edema and effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly which is stable.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease of pulmonary edema and effusions.
 2.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect scarring and resolving
 edema.
 3.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.
