                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with end-stage renal disease requiring
 assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate vascular congestion and an enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, which suggests mild pulmonary edema.  There are moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There are consolidations in the lower lobes bilaterally
 which could simply be areas of lung collapse, however pneumonia cannot be
 ruled out on this exam.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph after diuresis to
 rule out pneumonia at the lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar consolidations, likely lung collapse, but cannot rule
 out pneumonia.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph after diuresis to reassess
 for pneumonia.
