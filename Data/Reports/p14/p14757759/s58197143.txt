                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, bilateral asymmetrical airspace opacities
 have slightly improved, and remain more severe in the right lung than the
 left.  These findings may be due to the patient's history of ARDS, with or
 without superimposed secondary process such as infection.  Small to moderate
 pleural effusions also appear unchanged.
