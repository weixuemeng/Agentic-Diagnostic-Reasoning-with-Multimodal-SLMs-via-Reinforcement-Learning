 FINDINGS:  A new right hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium just
 beyond the atriocaval junction.  A right internal jugular catheter ends at the
 atriocaval junction.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are unchanged.  The
 bilateral heterogeneous hazy opacities have slightly worsened from the prior
 radiograph, suggesting worsening pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.

 just beyond the atriocaval junction.
 2.  Worsening mild pulmonary edema.
