                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, pneumonia, and ARDS.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest CT, ___.
 Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is approximately 2.5 cm from the carina.  A
 right internal jugular ends in the right atrium just beyond the superior
 atriocaval junction.  A feeding tube is in the stomach.  The bilateral diffuse
 hazy opacifications have increased since the prior study, which may be due to
 slightly more edema or accentuation of stable edema due to lower lung volumes
 from a recent reduction in PEEP.  New bilateral pleural effusions are present.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New bilateral small pleural effusions.
 2.  Worsening edema, or possible accentuation of stable edema from a recent
 reduction in PEEP.
