                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right middle lobe consolidation seen on
 prior CT of ___, is here for further evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Heterogeneous
 opacities in the right middle lobe, are consistent with pneumonia.  Dense
 curvilinear opacity overlying the left mid lung (since the prior study) likely
 a calcified granuloma or a small AVM is unchanged.  Moderate-sized bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right with left basal atelectasis is
 similar to prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right middle lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with compressive left basal
 atelectasis.
