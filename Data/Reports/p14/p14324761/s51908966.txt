 INDICATION:  Fever and history of pneumonia with ongoing cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right middle lobe opacity has resolved.  No new opacities
 identified.  The pleural effusions have also resolved.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  A curvilinear dense opacity overlying the left mid
 lung zone is unchanged and may represent a calcified granuloma or small AVM. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no free air below the
 hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of right middle lobe pneumonia.  No new pneumonia is
 identified.
 2.  Resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Stable curvilinear density in the left mid lung zone, likely a calcified
 granuloma or AVM.
