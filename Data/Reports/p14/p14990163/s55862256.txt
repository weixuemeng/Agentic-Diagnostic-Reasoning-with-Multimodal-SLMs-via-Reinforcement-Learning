                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pancreatic cancer, failure to thrive,
 subjective fever  // Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen and pelvis ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Small bilateral pleural effusions appear
 unchanged.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases, similar to the
 prior study.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Small
 nodules concerning for metastases are better assessed on the prior CT of the
 abdomen and pelvis.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.  Percutaneous catheter within the upper abdomen is
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
