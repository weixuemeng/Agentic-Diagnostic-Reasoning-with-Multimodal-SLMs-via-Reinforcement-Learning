                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA abdomen and pelvis ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the aortic
 knob.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small to moderate size left
 pleural effusion and a trace right pleural effusion are new compared to the
 previous exams.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced on
 the left, and could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration are not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate size left, and trace right pleural effusions, new compared
 to the previous exams.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced on
 the left, and could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
