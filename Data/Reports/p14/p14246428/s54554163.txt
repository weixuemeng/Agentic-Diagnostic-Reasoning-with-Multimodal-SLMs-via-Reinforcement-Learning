                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma exacerbation.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right lower lobe predominantly parenchymal opacity reflects
 pneumonia.  There are extensive right upper lobe parenchymal changes as well
 with diffuse reticular nodular opacities noted in the right upper lobe as well
 as the right lower lobe.  By comparison, the left lung is essentially clear. 
 While there were paraseptal emphysematous changes on the ___ CT of the
 chest, the changes in the right lung today appear to represent chronic but
 worsening interstitial process with superimposed pneumonia.
 
 The heart size is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An
 old right clavicular fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with pneumonia
 superimposed on diffuse right lung reticular nodular opacities are worrisome
 for an overall worsening chronic interstitial process.  These changes are
 beyond just simple "asthma" and if the patient does not have a pulmonologist,
 consultation with one as an outpatient is probably appropriate as well high
 resolution CT of the chest.
