                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:37
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post PEA arrest, intubated with lots
 of mucinous secretions, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 4:45.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 4:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult given
 marked patient rotation on the current study.  Right internal jugular central
 line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position,
 although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visible on the current study. 
 There is likely a layering left effusion.  Patchy opacity at the right lung
 base is again seen and likely reflects atelectasis.  There continues to be
 some more focal opacity at the left apex which is improving in aeration since
 ___ at 20:23.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
