                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory arrest secondary to presumed mucus plugging.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Tracheostomy is in standard position. 
 Right internal jugular catheter ends in lower SVC.  A small right pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis is similar to the prior study. Increased
 opacification of the left chest is predominantly due to a large pleural
 effusion, obscuring the left lung. Mediastinal veins are not distended.
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.
