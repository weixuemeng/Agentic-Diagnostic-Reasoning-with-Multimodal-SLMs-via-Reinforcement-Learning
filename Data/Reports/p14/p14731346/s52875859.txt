                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, status post intubation with increasing oxygen
 requirement, evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:56 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube ends 6.1 cm above the
 carina, slightly above the level of the clavicular heads.  Right internal
 jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube courses to the
 stomach, but the tip is out of view.  Since 3:56 a.m., lung volumes are
 slightly lower with increased opacification of the left hemithorax which may
 be due to further atelectasis.  There is a substantial component of left lung
 volume loss as the mediastinum is shifted to the left.  The right lung is
 clear.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube is slightly high, ending 6.1 cm above the
 carina and could be advanced for better seating.
