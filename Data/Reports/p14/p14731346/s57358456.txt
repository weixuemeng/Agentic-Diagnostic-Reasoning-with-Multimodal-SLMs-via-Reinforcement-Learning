                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure it now intubated, evaluate for ET tube
 placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip
 terminating 4.3 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube has also been placed
 with the tip terminating in the gastric fundus. 
 
 There is a dense opacity seen in the right upper lung with associated
 rightward tracheal deviation, which is concerning for right upper lobe
 collapse.  In the right lung base there is now a new opacity which may be due
 to aspiration or hemorrhage.  The previously seen left upper and lower lobe
 opacities have improved although minimal persistent patchy opacity is seen in
 the left lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminating 4.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube tip within
 the stomach.
 
 2.  Right upper lung opacity which is concerning for right upper lobe
 collapse.  New right lung base patchy opacity could represent aspiration or
 hemorrhage.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
