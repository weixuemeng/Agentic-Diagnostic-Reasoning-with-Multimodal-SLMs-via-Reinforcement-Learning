                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support

 consistent with effusions and compressive atelectasis.  The possibility of
 slowly clearing infection or pulmonary hemorrhage could be considered.
