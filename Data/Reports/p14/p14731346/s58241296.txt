                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:15 P.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:15 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  There is a persistent left pleural
 effusion with associated airspace process most likely representing partial
 lower lobar collapse, although pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded.  The
 remaining visualized lungs are clear.  There is some cephalization of the
 vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is evident.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  A patchy opacity at the right medial lung base is
 again noted and likely reflects atelectasis.
