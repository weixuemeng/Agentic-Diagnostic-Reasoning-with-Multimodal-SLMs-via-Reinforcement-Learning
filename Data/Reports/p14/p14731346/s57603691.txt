                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mild mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable
 allowing for patient rotation.  Persistent opacity within the left lower lobe
 is demonstrated with likely a small sized left pleural effusion.  There is a
 new perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing in the left upper lobe,
 suggestive of asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  No focal consolidation is noted in the right lung
 though there is atelectasis at the right lower lobe.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New left perihilar haziness, vascular indistinctness and peribronchial
 cuffing likely reflective of asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema. Continued
 follow up after diuresis is recommended.
 
 2.  Persistent left lower lobe opacity with likely a small left pleural
 effusion, the former of which may reflect compressive atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Trace right pleural effusion is unchanged.
