 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lung collapse, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the collapse of the left
 lung is now complete.  The right hemithorax has slightly decreased in volume
 and a subtle opacity is seen at the right lung base, likely atelectasis.  The 
 central venous lines are unchanged.
