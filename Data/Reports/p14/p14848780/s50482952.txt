                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach in place complaining of left sided
 chest pain and difficulty breathing  // evaluate for pneumothorox, pulmonary
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the overall appearance is similar.  Again
 seen is CHF with interstitial edema, bilateral small to moderate effusions and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  CHF findings are probably slightly
 improved.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 ET tube, NG tube with tip extending beneath diaphragm, and right IJ line
 noted.  There is an unusual is semi circular density overlying the lower left
 heart medially -- this has been present on multiple prior films, though its
 position appears to change.  It appears to correspond to a a metallic density
 in the superficial soft tissues of the left chest, possibly a fragment of
 sternal wires .
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with interstitial edema, small to mild bilateral effusions and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation remains present.  Possible mild improvement in
 CHF findings. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Metallic foreign body again noted.
