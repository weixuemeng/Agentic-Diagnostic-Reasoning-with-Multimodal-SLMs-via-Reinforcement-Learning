                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky opacity is
 new at the left base but suggestive only of minor atelectasis.  Very mild
 vascular congestion is suspected and perhaps somewhat increased.  Otherwise,
 the lungs remain clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest minimal vascular congestion.  No definite focal opacity
 suggestive of pneumonia; left basilar opacities probably due to minor
 atelectasis.
