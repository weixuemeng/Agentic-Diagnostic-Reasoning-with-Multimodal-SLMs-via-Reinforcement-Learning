                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CHF and possible viral pneumonia.
 Assess interval improvement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The previously
 existing marked cardiac enlargement has regressed but moderate cardiac
 enlargement remains.  Generally widened and markedly elongated thoracic aorta
 as before.  No new local contour abnormalities are identified.  Previously
 existing distended pulmonary vasculature, significant perivascular haze has
 improved and the pulmonary vasculature is now unremarkable.  The lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free, thus no evidence of accumulating pleural
 effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal view
 with no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of previously identified cardiac enlargement
 and pulmonary congestion.  Again, no evidence of pneumothorax or new acute
 pneumonic infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successfully resolved CHF.  No new abnormalities.
