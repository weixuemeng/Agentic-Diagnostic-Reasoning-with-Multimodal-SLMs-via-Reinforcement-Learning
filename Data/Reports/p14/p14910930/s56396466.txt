                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:15 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with small cell lung cancer complicated by SVC
 syndrome and pleural effusions.  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Greater bulk in the region of the right hilus and paratracheal station is
 probably a function of the extent of right upper lobe atelectasis, given the
 appearance of prior chest radiographs from early in ___.  Very coarse
 reticulation in the right upper lobe is probably a function of lymphangitic
 tumor extension from an obstructing right hilar mass.  The process is less
 pronounced in the left lung where diffuse interstitial abnormality could be
 due to volume overload, and it is exaggerated by severe emphysema.  Heart size
 is normal.  No pneumothorax.
