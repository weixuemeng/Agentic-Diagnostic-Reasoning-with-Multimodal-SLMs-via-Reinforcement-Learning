                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cancer with radiation therapy and persistent hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again evidence of a
 right hilar and upper lobe opacity consistent with the mass seen on CT with
 more peripheral changes consistent with postobstructive disease.  Continued
 widening of the superior mediastinum.
 
 There is increased opacification at the right base, consistent with worsening
 pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.
 
 Diffuse interstitial changes throughout both lungs are again seen.
