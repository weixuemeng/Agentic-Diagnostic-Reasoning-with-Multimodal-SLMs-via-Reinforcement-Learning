                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with SCLC and SVC syndrome, worsening hypoxia,
 tachypnea.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  This study is read in comparison with CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The previously
 seen right hilar and right upper lobe opacity is again seen and is consistent
 with mass seen on recent CT scan.  Elevation of the right lung base with
 associated volume loss in the upper lobe is also unchanged since prior study. 
 There is also some post-obstructive changes in the right upper lobe, which
 appear less prominent than on prior study.   The mediastinal width is
 unchanged compared to prior radiograph.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in previously seen post-obstructive changes
 and improved aeration of the right lung.  Otherwise, unchanged since the prior
 study.
