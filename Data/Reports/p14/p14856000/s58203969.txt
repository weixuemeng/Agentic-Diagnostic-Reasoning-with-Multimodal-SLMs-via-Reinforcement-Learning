                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hyperinflated lungs.  There is a small to moderate right
 pleural effusion.  No appreciable pleural fluid is seen on the left. 
 Diffusely increased opacity bilaterally likely reflects mild pulmonary edema. 
 Slightly increased opacity in the right mid lung may reflect atelectasis
 related to the pleural effusion, but an infectious process cannot be excluded.
 There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Opacity of the right mid lung
 may reflect associated atelectasis, but an infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
