                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Overlying EKG
 leads limits evaluation.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is blunting of
 the right hemidiaphragm which appears essentially stable from the prior
 imaging study.  There is a probable small right pleural effusion.  Areas of
 subtle nodular opacities within the lung are poorly visualized with biapical
 pleural parenchymal scarring again noted.  Consider CT to assess for interval
 changes with most recent prior CT exam dated ___.  Mediastinal contour
 appears stable.  Chronic deformity of the right proximal humerus noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Scattered nodular opacities as seen on prior CT chest warrant a
 followup CT to assess for subtle interval changes/stability.
