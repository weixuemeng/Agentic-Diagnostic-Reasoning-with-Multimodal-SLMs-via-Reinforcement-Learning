                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p mechanical fall, with tachypnea in 40s  // eval for
 intrathoracic process, pt with RR 40s      eval for intrathoracic process, pt
 with RR 40s
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has redistributed, now exclusively in the lower lobes
 accompanied by increasing small pleural effusions and probable mild
 atelectasis.  Upper lungs are now clear.  Heart size is normal.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
