                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including mild cardiomegaly.  There is marked elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with streaky associated opacification suggesting minor
 associated atelectasis.  There is a round nodular focus projecting over the
 right mid lung, most likely a nipple shadow but confirmation with a PA view
 with nipple markers is suggested when clinically appropriate.  Degenerative
 changes are similar along the mid to lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the right lower lung, most likely nipple
 shadow; confirmation with an additional PA view with nipple markers is
 suggested in follow-up.  
 
 3.  Marked similar elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
