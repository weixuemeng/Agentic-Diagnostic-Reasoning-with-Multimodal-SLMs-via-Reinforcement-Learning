                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable AP views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  As on prior, there is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 with multiple air-filled loops of bowel beneath it.  There is new right
 basilar opacity which obscures visualization of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to small effusion or
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Noting mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vasculature which could be due to lower lung volumes with component
 of vascular congestion also possible.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes on the current exam.  New right basilar
 opacity which could be due to any combination of atelectasis, effusion or
 consolidation.  Otherwise, no definite interval change given differences in
 positioning and technique since prior.  Two-view chest x-ray could be
 performed to further characterize if patient is amenable.
