                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new cough ; evaluate for evolving pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased in the interim. Left lower lobe opacity with air
 bronchogram stent silhouetting of the descending thoracic aorta and mild
 indistinctness of the medial left hemidiaphragm persists and is perhaps more
 conspicuous from the prior exam, consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Opacity in the right lower lobe is slightly more conspicuous, but in the
 setting of lower lung volumes, is consistent with atelectasis. No edema or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The post pyloric
 enteric tube is only partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2. Lower lung volumes.
