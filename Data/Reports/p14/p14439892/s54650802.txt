                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chronic HBV cirrhosis s/p OLT (___) and take back for
 bleeding (___) currently extubated and not on any pressers for hemodynamic
 support.  // Respiratory distress     Respiratory distress
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The opacification at the bases, especially on the
 right, is less prominent.  Although this could represent improved pleural
 effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis, it could merely represent a more
 upright position of the patient.
 Little change in the cardiac silhouette with only mild if any elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
