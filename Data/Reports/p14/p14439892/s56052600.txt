                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chronic HBV cirrhosis s/p OLT (___) and take back for
 bleeding (___) currently extubated and not on any pressers for hemodynamic
 support.  // post intubation     post intubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in
 place with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 7 cm above the
 carina.  Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
 Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Bibasilar
 opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is again consistent
 with a combination of layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at
 the bases.  Cardiac silhouette is stable and there is mild if any elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
