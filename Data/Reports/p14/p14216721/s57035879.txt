                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Emphysema, new hemoptysis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ chest CT.
 
 Gradual enlargement of the right hilus in particular at its inferior portion
 is demonstrated and might contribute to abnormalities seen on the prior study
 such as right lower lung nodular opacities, potentially branching and
 demonstrating inspissated mucus in the bronchi, but pulmonary nodules and
 lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  The CT findings appear to be
 progressed/new as compared to ___.  Given additional progression
 on the current examination, re-assessment with chest CT preferably after
 administration of IV contrast is recommended.  Hyperinflation is better
 appreciated on the lateral view.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
