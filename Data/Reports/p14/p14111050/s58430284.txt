 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea and chest pain.  Eval for pna.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the hila appear more congested with evidence of
 interstitial pulmonary edema and new small bilateral pleural effusions.  There
 are persistent lower lung opacities, concerning for pneumonia.  These have
 improved in the right lung base, but are stable to marginally worsened in the
 left lung base.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Compared with the prior radiograph, there is new interstitial pulmonary
 edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Persistent bilateral lower lung opacities concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia.  These have improved in the right lung base, but are stable to
 marginally worsened in the left lung base.
