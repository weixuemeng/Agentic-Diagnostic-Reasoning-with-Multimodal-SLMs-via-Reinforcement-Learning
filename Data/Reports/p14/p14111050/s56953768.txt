 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___ WITH COMPARISON ___
 RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  All the support devices are unchanged in position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Multifocal patchy
 and linear opacities, predominantly in the right juxtahilar and left basilar
 regions, show interval worsening in the left lower lobe.  These findings most
 likely represent atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is not excluded.  Small
 left pleural effusion is present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
