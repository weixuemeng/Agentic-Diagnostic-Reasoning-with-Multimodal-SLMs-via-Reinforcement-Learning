                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, status post PEA arrest, intubated, fevers.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 3:19 a.m.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, --___ tip lies
 approximately 4.0 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- the tip is
 difficult to trace, but extends beneath the diaphragm off film.  A dual-lumen
 right IJ line is present, tip over proximal most SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with patchy opacities at both lung bases
 and a small left effusion.  Compared with the prior film, the overall
 appearance is quite similar.  There is mild upper zone redistribution, but
 doubt other evidence of CHF -- moreover, this appearance may be accentuated by
 low lung volumes.
