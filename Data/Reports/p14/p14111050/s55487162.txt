 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Renal failure, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen in unchanged extent and
 severity.  In addition, there is mild-to-moderate interstitial lung edema. 
 The changes have not substantially evolved since the previous exam.  As
 documented on the lateral radiograph, the pleural effusions are also stable. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
