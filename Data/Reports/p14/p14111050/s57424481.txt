                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post extubation, desaturation to
 ___%, questionable pulmonary edema or infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  In comparison with the next previous examination of
 ___, the patient has been extubated and the NG tube has been
 removed.  Right internal jugular central venous line has been placed, now seen
 to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at the level of
 the carina.  This corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax on either side.  In comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination, the at that time existing linear
 densities on the right base have disappeared, indicating resolution of the
 local atelectasis.  A small linear density exists now on the left base
 indicating a peripheral atelectasis.  The left lateral pleural sinus is now
 free indicating regression of the previously suspected small amount of pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax following extubation.  Improved
 ventilation of lung bases in comparison with previous study.
