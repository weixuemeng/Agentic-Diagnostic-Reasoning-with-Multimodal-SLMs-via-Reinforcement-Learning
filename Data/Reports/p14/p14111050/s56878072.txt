                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and wheezing, evaluation for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 fluid overload have markedly improved.  On the current image, there is no
 evidence of intravascular or interstitial excess fluid.  However, the cardiac
 silhouette continues to be large, so that further radiographic monitoring is
 warranted, depending on the clinical presentation of the patient.
