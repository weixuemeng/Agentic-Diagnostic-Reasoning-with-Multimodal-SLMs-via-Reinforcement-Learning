                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chronic renal
 insufficiency, asthma and hypertension.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient is in interstitial pulmonary edema.  In addition, there are more
 focal opacities, in the right mid lung and in the left perihilar area as well
 as in the lung bases that although potentially representing interstitial
 pulmonary edema can reflect infectious process as well.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are better appreciated on the lateral view.  The assessment
 of the patient after diuresis to decide if old abnormalities are related to
 pulmonary edema or some of them can be related to infectious process is
 required.
