                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man febrile s/p BKA  // ?consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a new poorly defined
 opacity is developed at the right lung base.  Accompanying signs of volume
 loss favor the presence of atelectasis, but coexisting infectious process is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for minimal linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
