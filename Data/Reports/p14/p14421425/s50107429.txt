                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 Cardiomegaly is noted.  The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is
 significant unfolding of thoracic aorta.  There is some thickening of the
 minor fissure on the right side and there are focal areas of linear
 atelectasis in the left mid zone.  The right-sided pleural effusion has
 significantly decreased in size when compared to prior study.  No definitive
 effusion persists.  There is multilevel degenerative change of the thoracic
 spine.  There is only minimal if any evidence of residual fluid overload.
 
 Finally, an apparent left retrocardiac rounded opacity measuring up to 18 mm,
 revealed by the resolving dependent change has no correlate on a recent chest
 CTA (___), and presumptively represents confluent shadowing.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Decreased to improved effusion.
