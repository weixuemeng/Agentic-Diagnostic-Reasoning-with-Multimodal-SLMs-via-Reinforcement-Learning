                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size with only a
 small amount of fluid remaining, predominantly within the fissures.  However,
 based on the configuration of the right hemidiaphragm, there may be a
 subpulmonic component of the effusion resulting in lateral peaking of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  On the left, could be a small amount of fluid
 posteriorly in the posterior costophrenic sulcus.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable in appearance with persistent tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Lungs are clear except for minimal linear atelectasis in the left mid and
 lower lung regions.  Marked degenerative changes are present at both
 shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in small right pleural effusion.  Configuration
 of right hemidiaphragm suggests there may be potentially more substantial
 pleural fluid present with a subpulmonic distribution.  A right lateral
 decubitus radiograph could confirm or exclude this possibility if warranted
 clinically.
