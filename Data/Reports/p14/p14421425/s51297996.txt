                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left-sided chest pain, history of coronary disease,
 question pneumothorax, question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is thickening/fluid along
 the minor fissure.  There is elevation and eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm with overlying right base atelectasis.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the aorta calcified and tortuous and
 the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged.  Slight prominence of the hila is
 stable, which may relate to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No focal
 consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There are degenerative
 changes at the partially imaged left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Thickening/fluid along the minor fissure.  No focal consolidation.
