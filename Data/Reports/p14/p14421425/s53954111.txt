                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, to rule out effusion or changes in the effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, accompanying right lung atelectasis
 is unchanged since ___.  Increased retrocardiac density on the left
 side and reflecting left lower lung volume loss and probably small left
 pleural effusion is also similar.  Right internal jugular catheter sheath tip
 is at upper/mid SVC.  There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and sternal
 sutures are intact, consistent with status post AVR.  Mild to moderately
 enlarged heart size and minimally widened mediastinum suggesting mediastinal
 congestion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over last 24 hours, moderate-to-large pleural effusion
 accompanying right lung atelectasis and increased retrocardiac density
 reflecting volume loss and small effusion are all unchanged.
