                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, tachypnea, recent trauma. Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from earlier on the same date and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina. The right IJ central
 catheter terminates in the lower SVC. No pneumothorax. No significant change
 in the vascular engorgement and bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema, worse
 on the left. It is difficult to decipher how much of this is due to chronic
 interstitial disease.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged, as is the right
 pacer/defibrillator with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Left
 subclavian and left IJ stents are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of an ET tube, which terminates 6.8 cm above the carina.
 
 2. No change in the left greater than right interstitial pulmonary edema.
