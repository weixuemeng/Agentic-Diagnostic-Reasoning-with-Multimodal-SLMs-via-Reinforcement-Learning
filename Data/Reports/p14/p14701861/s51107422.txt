                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation, restrictive lung disease. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heavy pleural thickening and calcifications overlying both sides of the chest
 make it difficult to assess the lungs. There has been no change in the
 widespread interstitial abnormality, present on the earliest post trauma
 imaging studies from ___, suggesting the these may be chronic
 findings.
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the carina, with pooling
 secretions above the ET tube cuff. The NG tube passes into the stomach and out
 of view. No change in the right pacemaker defibrillator, with leads in the
 right atrium and right ventricle. Again, the Swan-Ganz catheter passes as far
 as the descending right pulmonary artery and is obscured by the pacemaker. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Unchanged widespread interstitial abnormality, present on the earliest post
 trauma imaging studies from ___ may be chronic interstitial lung
 disease, rather than pulmonary edema. However, if uncertain of hemodynamic
 status, Chest CT might be able to distinguish between them.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the carina and should be advanced
 at least 1 cm ; pooling secretions above the ET tube cuff.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 11:06 on ___, ___ min after
 discovery.
