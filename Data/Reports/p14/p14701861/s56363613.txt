                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (portable AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, tachypnea. Evaluate for fluid overload,
 acute change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, no significant change in the degree of
 vascular engorgement and interstitial pulmonary edema, more severe on the
 left. It is difficult to decipher how much of these changes are due to chronic
 interstitial disease, as correlated with the CT torso from the prior day. The
 abnormally thickened/partially calcified pleura is unchanged, as is the right
 pacer/defibrillator, with continuous leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema is unchanged, more severe on the left. It is difficult to
 decipher how much of these changes are due to chronic interstitial disease, as
 seen on the CT torso from the prior day.
