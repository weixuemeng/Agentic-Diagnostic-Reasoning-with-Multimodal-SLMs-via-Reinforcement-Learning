                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with restrictive lung dz, ?PNA  // eval for
 interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Column chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been no recent change in widespread interstitial abnormality,
 resolving right lower and left upper lobe consolidation,.  The heavy pleural
 thickening and calcification overlying both sides of the chest make it
 difficult to assess the lungs.  Conventional chest radiographs should be
 performed when feasible.
 
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no
 less than 6 cm from the carina. Since the chin is elevated the tube should not
 be advanced more than one cm. The nasogastric drainage tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.
 
 Right atrial pacer, right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged
 in their respective positions.  Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter passes as
 far as the descending right pulmonary artery where it is obscured by the
 pacemaker generator.
 There is no pneumothorax.
