                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Persistent linear bibasilar atelectasis.  Slightly more
 confluent opacity projects posteriorly over the spine on the lateral view,
 obscuring the posterior hemidiaphragms bilaterally, likely corresponding to
 patchy areas of increased opacity in the retrocardiac area on the frontal
 view.  There are no pleural effusions.  Rounded opacity in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen corresponds to post-TACE changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, most likely due to atelectasis, but
 coexisting aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the dependent
 portions of both lower lobes.
