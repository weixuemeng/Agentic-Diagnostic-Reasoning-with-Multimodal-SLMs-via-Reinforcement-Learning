                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.
 The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A right lower
 lobe opacity is related mostly to atelectasis but an underlying consolidation
 is suspected. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable right lower lobe consolidation. Bibasilar atelectasis
 secondary to low lung volumes.
