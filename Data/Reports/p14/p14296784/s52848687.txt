 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, r/o pulm edema or pna  // r/o pulm
 edema or pna
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest radiograph currently available was performed
 ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema is moderate to severe. Generalized interstitial abnormality is
 relatively evenly distributed, and although there is mild vascular engorgement
 in the lungs, there is no increase in normal heart size, caliber of
 mediastinal veins, or appreciable pleural effusion. This could be pulmonary
 edema in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, but probably not due to
 more chronic cardiac decompensation. Thoracic aorta is calcified but not
 dilated. Lungs are clear of any focal abnormality such as pneumonia.
