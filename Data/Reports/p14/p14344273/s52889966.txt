 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  MAC, triple antibiotics, assessment for changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Large lung volumes, bilateral apical thickening that is symmetrical
 in distribution.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette and extensive
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.  The subtle bilateral
 parenchymal opacities are unchanged in size and morphology.
