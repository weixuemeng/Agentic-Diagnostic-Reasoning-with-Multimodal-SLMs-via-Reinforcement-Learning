                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pulmonary MAC and increased cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through
 ___, including a chest CT on ___.
 
 There has been no detectable change in the conventional chest radiographs
 since ___.  The extensive dilatation and wall thickening of
 small bronchi throughout the lungs on chest CT scans, most recently ___, has generally not been detectable on conventional radiographs.  There
 may be a single 5-mm wide nodule in the right lung projecting just beneath the
 lower margin of the clavicle that can be seen in retrospect on prior chest
 radiographs and chest CT.  I do not see any evidence of progression of
 bronchiectasis, although any change would have to be substantial.  Atelectasis
 in the middle lobe along the minor fissure is still seen as apparent 
 thickening of the fissure on the lateral view.  Pleural effusion was present
 on ___, but subsequently resolved.  Heart is normal size. 
 Thoracic aorta is very tortuous but not dilated.  There are no findings to
 suggest central lymph node enlargement.  Senile kyphosis is moderate-to-severe
 without any discrete compression fracture.
