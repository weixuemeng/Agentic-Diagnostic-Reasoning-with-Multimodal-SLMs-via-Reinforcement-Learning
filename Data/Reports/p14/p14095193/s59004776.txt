                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with one week of cough and crackles at the right
 base.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Although the frontal chest radiograph is virtually unchanged since ___,
 lateral view raises question of a small region of retrocardiac consolidation,
 perhaps in the anteromedial basal segment of one of the lower lobes.  Oblique
 views would be helpful in determining whether such abnormality is really
 present.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is
 very tortuous but not clearly dilated.  Other mediastinal and hilar contours
 and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged and we discussed the findings by telephone at 11am.
