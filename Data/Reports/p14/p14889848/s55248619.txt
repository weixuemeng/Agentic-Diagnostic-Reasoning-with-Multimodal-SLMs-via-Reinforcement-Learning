                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  Comparison was extended to the next preceding chest examination of
 our own institution, which was dated ___.  At that time, the
 chest findings were within normal limits and thus similar to what is present
 now.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumonia diagnosed on outside
 hospital on ___.  This was a right middle lobe pneumonia, and there was
 also a question of thickening along the pleural margin.  Patient had the other
 hospital imaging uploaded into our system already.  Please compare.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding chest
 examination obtained at an outside hospital dated ___ (___
 ___).  On today's examination, the heart size is within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is identified. 
 Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No mediastinal abnormalities are seen.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present.  There exists a local thickening of the
 pleura in the right apical area.  This, however, is smoothly delineated and no
 corresponding interstitial parenchymal scar formations can be identified.  The
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free, and there is no evidence of
 pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior pleural sinuses as can be
 identified on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
 
 When comparison is made with the previous outside chest examination of
 ___, at that time existing pneumonic infiltrate in the right
 middle lobe area has disappeared.  Inspection of the previous lateral view
 suggests that the infiltrate was located in a subapical segment of the right
 lower lobe.  Under any circumstances, this infiltrate has disappeared and no
 acute remaining infiltrate is identified.  The right apical pleural thickening
 appears stable.
