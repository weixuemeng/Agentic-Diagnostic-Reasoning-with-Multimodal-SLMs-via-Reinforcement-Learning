                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is
 asymmetric left apical pulmonary opacity worrisome for underlying nodule. 
 Surgical chain sutures seen in the right mid lung.  There is also subtle
 increased opacity projecting over the right breast shadow, anteriorly on the
 lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings compatible with COPD.  Subtle asymmetric right basilar opacity
 potentially in the middle lobe which could represent atelectasis or scarring
 however infection cannot be totally excluded.
 
 Findings worrisome for left apical pulmonary nodule for which dedicated
 nonurgent chest CT is suggested.
