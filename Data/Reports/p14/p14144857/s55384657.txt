                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left apical consolidation is new since the prior study, raising concern for
 pneumonia.  Right lower lobe consolidation has resolved.  Chain sutures are
 seen in the right mid to lower lung.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter, consistent with
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is evidence of pulmonary
 emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left apical consolidation is worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up
 radiographs after treatment to exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion.
 
 Improved right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 COPD and pulmonary emphysema.
