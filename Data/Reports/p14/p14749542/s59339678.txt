                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with febrile cough illness. ___ Minute Clinic
 today heard rales and sent her here for presumed pneumonia. On my exam she has
 coarse BS in L base but no clear focal rales.  // eval for pneumonia
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An opacity along the minor fissure seen only on the lateral view could be
 developing pneumonia in the right middle lobe or lingula in correct clinical
 setting. It is unclear if this is an artifact from rib shadowing. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An opacity along the minor fissure seen only on the lateral view could be rib
 shadowing, but developing pneumonia in the right middle lobe or lingula cannot
 be ruled out in correct clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on ___
 at 14:31 into the Department of Radiology critical communications system for
