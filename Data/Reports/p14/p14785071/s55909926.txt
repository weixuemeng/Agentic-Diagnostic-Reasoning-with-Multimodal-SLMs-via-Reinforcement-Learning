                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and new cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  Interstitial abnormality is
 likely unchanged and probably relates to extensive paraseptal emphysema seen
 on the prior chest CT.  There is no right pleural effusion with perhaps trace
 left pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size and normal mediastinal and
 hilar contours.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps trace left pleural effusion without acute intrathoracic
 process.
