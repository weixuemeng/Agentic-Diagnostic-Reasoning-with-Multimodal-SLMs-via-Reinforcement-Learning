                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 CT of the chest on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Despite moderately severe emphysema, lung volumes are lower
 compared to ___, and crowding of mild pulmonary edema may explain
 greater opacification in the right lower lobe on the frontal view.
 Opacification in the left lower lobe could be residual atelectasis, following
 resolution of prior left pleural effusion, but needs to be followed for
 possible new pneumonia. Pulmonary arteries are still large, but
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Degenerative changes of the AC joints
 are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema. COPD
 2.  Suggest followup conventional radiographs to monitor possible early
 pneumonia in both lower lobes.
 3.  Interval improvement of left pleural effusion.
 4.  Dr ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 approval.
