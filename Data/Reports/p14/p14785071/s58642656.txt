                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, right lower lobe rales.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The patient has
 known paraseptal emphysema on prior chest CT.  Background of chronic mild
 increased interstitial markings, with new opacities seen in the right
 mid-to-lower lung, worrisome for infection.  There is also a moderate-to-large
 left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is
 not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  Mid-to-lower lung opacity
 raises concern for pneumonia with background of chronic lung disease.  There
 is also concern for superimposed component of pulmonary edema.
