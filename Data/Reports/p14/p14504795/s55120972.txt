                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is again borderline in size and again with a left ventricular
 configuration.  There is patchy increased density and bronchial cuffing in
 each mid lung, suggesting airway inflammation, probably chronic.  A trace
 pleural effusion is suspected on the right only.  The bones are probably
 demineralized to some extent.  There is no pneumothorax.  An irregular contour
 to the sternum suggests a fracture, including a small displaced step-off
 appearance, new since the remote prior studies.  There is no soft tissue
 density effacing the anterior clear space deep to the sternum.
