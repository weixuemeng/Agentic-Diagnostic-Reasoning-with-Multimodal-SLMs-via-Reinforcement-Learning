                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated now spiking fever, evaluate for
 interval changes, aspiration event?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased bibasilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, may represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes or potentially aspiration or
 early pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the origin of
 the SVC.  The endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm from the carina.  An enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bibasilar airspace opacities may represent atelectasis related to
 low lung volumes or, in the proper clinical setting, aspiration or early
 pneumonia.
