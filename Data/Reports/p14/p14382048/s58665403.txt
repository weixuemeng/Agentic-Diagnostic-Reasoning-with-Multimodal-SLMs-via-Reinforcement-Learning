                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // VAP?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the right dialysis catheter extends into the right atrium.  A
 feeding tube extends into the stomach.  A left central venous catheter tip
 projects over the cavoatrial junction.
 
 There is a markedly enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, increased since
 prior.  Hazy bibasilar opacities, greater on the right, may reflect layering
 pleural fluid with subjacent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 Hyperdense material projects over the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a left central venous catheter, the tip extending to the
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Hazy bibasilar opacities, greater on the right likely reflect layering pleural
 effusions with subjacent atelectasis/ consolidation.
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
