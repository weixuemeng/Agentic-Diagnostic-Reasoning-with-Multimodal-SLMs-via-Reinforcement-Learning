                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with c/o CP with palpitations  // ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment. There is an apparent retrocardiac opacity on the lateral
 projection which obscures the posterior heart border raising potential concern
 for an early pneumonia in the right or left lower lobe though not clearly
 visualized on the frontal view. No large effusion or pneumothorax. No
 convincing signs of edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within
 normal limits. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity on the lateral projection only raising concern for
 an early pneumonia in the right or left lower lobe.  Please correlate
 clinically.
