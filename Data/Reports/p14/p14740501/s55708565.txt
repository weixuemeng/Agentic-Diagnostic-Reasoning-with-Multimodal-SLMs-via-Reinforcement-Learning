                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, now intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.9 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There is widening of superior mediastinum and
 mediastinal/aortic injury is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  There may be a left pleural effusion.  Prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature is concerning for underlying edema.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.9 cm above the level
 of the carina.  enteric tube is coiled partially imaged projecting over the
 partially imaged neck, if this represents the enteric tube, it is not
 appropriately positioned and coiled in the neck.
 
 The mediastinum is widened and mediastinal/aortic injury is not excluded.  No
 prior for comparison.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Left pleural
 effusion.  Additional left basilar opacity is seen.
 
 Vascular congestion.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ as well as wet read placed.
