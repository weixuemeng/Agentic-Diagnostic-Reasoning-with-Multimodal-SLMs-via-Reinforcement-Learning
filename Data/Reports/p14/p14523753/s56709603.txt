                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left upper quadrant pain and shaking. 
 Evaluate for chills/infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lungs are low in volume, responsible
 for crowding of vessels and exaggeration of top normal heart size, but
 essentially clear. Mediastinum is unremarkable, and pleural effusion is
 minimal if any.  There is no free intraperitoneal gas on this study labelled
 as having been obtained with the patient upright; if the patient was not
 upright, pneumoperitoneum might not be detected on this study.
