                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric
 tube courses into the stomach, its tip below the imaged region of the
 epigastrium. The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The lung volumes are low.
 Opacity at the left lung base suggests minor atelectasis, probably in the
 lingula.  Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude but not explicitly shown.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.
