                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, nonverbal found by
 family at 8am, moving all four extremities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes contribute to bibasilar atelectasis as well as
 bronchovascular crowding. The heart size is exaggerated due to the low lung
 volumes and the AP view. There are no focal opacities concerning for
 pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 The right paratracheal stripe is noted to be widened, possibly due to a
 tortuous vessel, however lymphadenopathy is not excluded.
 
 Patient status post thoracic spinal fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Atelectasis due to low lung volumes
 2. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe may be due to a tortuous vascular
 structure however lymphadenopathy or other mass lesion is not excluded.
 Correlation with prior imaging would be helpful. In the absence of such, a
 chest CT would be appropriate for further workup.
