 similar to prior exam cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided PICC seen terminating in the area of the cavoatrial
 junction/lower SVC.  If clinical concern exists for arrhythmia secondary to
 PICC position, could withdraw the catheter 1.0-1.5 cm. 
 
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, similar to prior exam.  
 
 3.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.  Mild vascular engorgement.
