                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior plain films dating back to ___ with
 most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are grossly clear of
 focal consolidation or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 larger compared to prior but this is likely due to positioning, lower lung
 volumes and AP technique.  Posterior thoracolumbar spinal fixation hardware is
 identified.  At several levels just superior to this fixation, there is
 anterior wedging of two adjacent vertebral bodies with irregularity of the
 endplates.  This finding was not as conspicuous on exam from ___ and has shown slow interval progression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Mild interval progression of vertebral body height loss with irregularity
 of the endplates in the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  In this patient with
 history of multiple myeloma, these could be (potentially pathologic)
 compression deformities, although similar findings can be seen with
 discitis/osteomyelitis.  Low threshold for dedicated imaging by MRI should  be
 considered.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the phone at 7:10 p.m. on ___.
