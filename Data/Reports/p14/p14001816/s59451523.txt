                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post PEA arrest.  Evaluate for ET tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung
 volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased
 opacification at the right lung base consistent with aspiration and
 atelectasis. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without frank
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours have returned to
 the approximate baseline level.  Endotracheal tube ends 5.7 cm from the ___,
 but is impinging on the sidewall of the trachea.  Nasogastric tube courses
 into the stomach and out of field of view.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina, but is impinging on the
 sidewall of the trachea, and should be adjusted.
 2.  Increased opacification at the right lung base consistent with aspiration
 and atelectasis. 
 3.  Engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema.
 
 COMMENTS: These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 10:16am on ___, 7 minutes after discovery.
