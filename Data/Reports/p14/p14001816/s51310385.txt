                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple myeloma and fever.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes account for some degree of bronchovascular
 crowding.  Vague opacities in both lung bases may be due to underinflation and
 summation of structures given superimposition of multiple ribs, although
 pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  Spinal hardware is
 also stable without evidence of hardware-related complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  LOWER LUNG VAGUE OPACITIES EQUIVOCAL FOR EARLY PNEUMONIA.
