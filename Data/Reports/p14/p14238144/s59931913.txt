                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations of technique,
 there is no definite abnormality of vasculature, but there is patchy opacity
 in the left mid-to-lower lung, possibly pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The azygos vein appears mildly prominent.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is a
 slight S-shaped thoracic spinal curvature.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mild prominence of the
 azygos vein could be a reflection of increased volume status, however.  Patchy
 left basilar opacity, for which developing pneumonia could be considered.
