                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with DVT  // evaluate for evidence of PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  A right mid lung opacity is triangular in shape and in
 an area with multiple overlying osseous structures, not well seen on lateral
 view.  There is mild vascular congestion without evidence of frank pulmonary
 edema.  The mediastinum is somewhat widened and cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique.  The hila are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Extensive degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific right mid lung opacity.  If clinical concern for pulmonary
 embolism, CTA of the chest should be obtained.
