 Inspiratory volumes are low, with prominent bibasilar atelectasis.  There is
 been some degree of improvement at the left base as the left hemidiaphragm is
 now visible.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora,
 slightly more pronounced, but likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film
 and also likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  No gross effusion,
 but a small effusion might not be apparent.

 1. ET tube tip approximately 2.2 cm above the carina.
