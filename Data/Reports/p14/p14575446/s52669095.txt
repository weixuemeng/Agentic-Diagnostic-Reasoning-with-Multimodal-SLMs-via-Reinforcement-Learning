                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with crich, evaluate endotracheal tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 03:00.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, endotracheal tube has been retracted and now ends at the level of
 the carina it can be retracted approximately 3 cm, for more optimal
 positioning.  There has been interval improvement in aeration of the left
 upper lung however there remains left basilar opacity.  Air is a parrot
 mediastinal widening, of unclear significance.  Right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval retraction of endotracheal tube which still appears to low at the
 level of the carina and can be pulled back approximately 3.0 cm.
 2. Improvement in left upper lobe aeration with continued opacity at the left
 base.
 3. Apparent widening of the mediastinum, may be due to supine technique.
