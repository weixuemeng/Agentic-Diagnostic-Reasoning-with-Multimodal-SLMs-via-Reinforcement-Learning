 placement  // evaluate ETT placement      evaluate ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest radiographs ___:30 through 05:17.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube extends at least as far as the proximal right main bronchus
 which may account for persistent left lower lobe collapse.  Mediastinal and
 pulmonary vascular engorgement suggest a component of cardiac decompensation,
 though mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Pleural effusion
 is small, on the left if any.  No pneumothorax.
