                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea status post CABG and MVR during ___  //

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve repair.  A
 left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminate in the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and coronary sinus, unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is similar.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  There is a small left pleural effusion, not substantially
 changed from the previous study with associated left basilar opacity likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
