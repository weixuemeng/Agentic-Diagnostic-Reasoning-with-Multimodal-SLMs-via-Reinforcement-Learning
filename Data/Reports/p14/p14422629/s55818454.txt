                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoker with chronic dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date from an
 outside facility, there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 single-channel pacer extending to the apex of the right ventricle.  Mild
 blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen, and there is no definite evidence
 of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 Of incidental note is a cervical fusion device.
