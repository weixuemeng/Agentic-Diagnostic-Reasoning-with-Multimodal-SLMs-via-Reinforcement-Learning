 FOR INTERVAL CHANGE
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been
 improvement in the degree of right apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise little
 change.  The opaque portion of the Dobhoff tube straddles the esophagogastric
 junction and the tube should be pushed forward about 5-10 cm for more optimal
 positioning.
