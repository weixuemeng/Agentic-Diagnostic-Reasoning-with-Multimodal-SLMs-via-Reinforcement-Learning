                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for last five days with known sick contacts.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for minimal bibasal atelectasis with no definite infection seen,
 although it cannot be entirely excluded in particular in the very posterior
 basal aspect of the left lower lobe.  If clinically warranted, followup of the
 patient in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy might be
 considered.
