                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post fall.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Diffuse pulmonary opacities could be
 consistent with a combination of severe pulmonary, widespread pneumonia, or
 ARDS.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Right-sided PICC
 line ends in upper SVC. Stable bibasilar pleural effusions are present.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary opacities could be consistent with a
 combination of severe pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia or ARDS.
