                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The orogastric tube extends to the lower-to-mid body of the
 stomach.  Lungs are not optimally visualized, though there again is
 obscuration of the left and, to a lesser extent, right hemidiaphragm
 consistent with volume loss and pleural effusion.
