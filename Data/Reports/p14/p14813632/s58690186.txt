                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, presenting with difficulty ambulating. 
 Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including ___ and dating back
 to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperinflated lungs
 consistent with emphysema.  Increasing opacities in the right middle lobe,
 which is retracted upwards in this patient, as well as patchier changes in the
 right lower lobe, have progressed since ___.  The right medial heart
 border is obscured on today's exam.  A left lower lobe nodule corresponds to
 the patient's small abscess seen on recent CT.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, there are continually worsening opacities in the
 right middle and right lower lobe.  The time course suggests an atypical
 infection such as mycoplasma or other form of chronic infectious etiology.
