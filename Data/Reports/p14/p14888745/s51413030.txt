                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Peribronchial
 thickening is present in the right infrahilar region accompanied by subtle
 streaky peribronchiolar opacities.  No segmental or lobar areas of
 consolidation are identified, and there are no pleural effusions.  Focal round
 opacity in the infrahilar region on the lateral view measuring 10 mm in
 diameter may be due to a prominent vascular structure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right infrahilar bronchial wall thickening, which may be due to acute
 bronchitis.  Early bronchopneumonia in this region cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  1 cm diameter round opacity in right infrahilar region may be due to a
 vessel viewed end-on, but consider a followup lateral radiograph with improved
 positioning to exclude the possibility of a discrete nodule.
 
 Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 11:35 a.m. on ___.
