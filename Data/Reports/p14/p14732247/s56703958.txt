                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with agitation, pain, tachycardia  // eval for ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrate clear lungs without a focal
 opacity convincing for pneumonia.  12 mm irregular opacity in the periphery of
 the right upper lobe is noted just below the right 6 posterior rib.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the aortic arch.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Focal opacity within the periphery of the right upper lobe
 warrants follow up radiographs for confirmation and further characterization
 in order to help distinguish is superimposition of normal structures from a
 discrete pulmonary abnormality such as focal scar or a lung cancer.
