                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?PNA  // interval progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a new patchy focus of opacity has
 developed in the left retrocardiac region.  This could reflect a developing
 pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity.  Alternatively, a focus of
 aspiration or atelectasis may produce a similar radiographic appearance. 
 Recently described right upper lobe nodular opacity appears to represent a
 cluster of adjacent small nodules, and may potentially represent granulomas at
 but is not fully characterized radiographically.  CT may be considered
 following resolution of the acute clinical condition for further
 characterization.
