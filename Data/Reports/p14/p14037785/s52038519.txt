                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with left subclavian, evaluate for line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed 1 hour prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC.  The
 tip of the endotracheal tube remains situated 2.5 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube is again seen with the side port canal above the GE junction and
 should be advanced by at least 9 cm to place the side port below the GE
 junction.  Lung volumes are slightly improved although there is persistent
 moderate pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema has improved since the prior study.
 3.  Side port of the enteric tube situated above the GE junction and should be
 advanced by at least 9 cm to place it into the gastric body.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Advancement of the enteric tube.
