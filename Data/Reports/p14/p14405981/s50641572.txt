                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with FUO  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Subtle right base
 opacity most likely represents combination of atelectasis and vascular
 structures, although infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able for better
 evaluation.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
