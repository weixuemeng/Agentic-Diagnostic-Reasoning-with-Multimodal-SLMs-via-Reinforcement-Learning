                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GBM and seizure, now with tachypnea with
 RR to 40s  // eval for changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip curled in the gastric fundus.  A right subclavian
 PICC line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, more distal than on the prior
 film.  No pneumothorax detected .
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly
 prominent, but unchanged and likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to the prior study.  There is minimal atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  Right hemidiaphragm is elevated, but unchanged.  No
 gross effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PICC line lies more distal on the prior film, at the SVC/RA junction.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation similar, possibly slightly
 more pronounced, than on the prior film.
 3. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, also may be slightly
 more pronounced.  No overt CHF.
 4. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base is probably also slightly more
 pronounced.
