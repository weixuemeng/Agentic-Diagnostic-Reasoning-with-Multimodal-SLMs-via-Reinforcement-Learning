                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pericardial effusion s/p drainage, now with
 drain removed  // Interval change      Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No change in the bibasilar opacifications consistent with
 pleural effusion and underlying basilar atelectasis.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is somewhat difficult to assess, though there probably is
 continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
