                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever,  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuate the size of the cardiac silhouette which
 remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is similar. Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Electronic devices project over the
 anterior aspects of the chest bilaterally with leads coursing cephalad into
 the neck compatible with deep brain stimulator devices.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
