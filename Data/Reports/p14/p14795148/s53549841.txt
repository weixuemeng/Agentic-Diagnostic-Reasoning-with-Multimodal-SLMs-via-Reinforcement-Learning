 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening heart failure and orthopnea, assess effusions or
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Worsening
 reasoning right effusion is noted, now large with associated compressive mid
 and lower lobe atelectasis.  There is also mild pulmonary edema noted with
 diffuse ground-glass opacity and pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is also
 a small left effusion.  Heart is enlarged though this is stable.  Mediastinal
