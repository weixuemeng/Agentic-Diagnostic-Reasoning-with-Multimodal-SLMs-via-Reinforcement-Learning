                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with metastatic lung cancer and shortness of
 breath.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 There are again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields more
 confluent within the right middle lobe at the site of known metastatic
 disease.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion with some loculation along
 the lateral chest wall which does appear stable.  There is mild improvement of
 the pulmonary interstitial edema since the previous study.  There is a
 left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC, stable.
