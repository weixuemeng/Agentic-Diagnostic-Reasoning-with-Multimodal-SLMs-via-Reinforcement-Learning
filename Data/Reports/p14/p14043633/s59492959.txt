 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post crush injury by tree with bilateral
 rib fractures and bilateral pneumothoraces.  Assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ and ___ at time 01:03, 9 hours prior to the current study. 
 The study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

 volume loss, likely representing atelectasis.  There is no focal pneumonia,
 pleural effusion, or significant pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged since the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral small apical pneumothoraces.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
