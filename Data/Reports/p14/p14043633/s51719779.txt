                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple rib fractures, evaluate
 rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 present.  Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of
 the thorax grossly within normal limits.  Thus, there is no evidence of any
 acute hip fracture, nor are there existing deformities or callus formation. 
 Preceding chest CT of ___ as well as trauma chest view of the same date
 is reviewed.  Nowhere is there any conclusive evidence of any rib fracture.
 
 Should clinical suspicion of rib fracture persists, please identify patient's
 local symptoms and ask for dedicated skeletal examination with BB markers for
 location.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The present PA and lateral chest views demonstrate normal
 findings.
