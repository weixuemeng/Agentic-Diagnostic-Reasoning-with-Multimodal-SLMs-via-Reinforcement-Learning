                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Patient found down.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes and AP technique accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 pulmonary vasculature. Heart size is moderately enlarged with prominent
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Several calcified mediastinal and hilar
 lymph nodes suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.  Moderate
 atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob. Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or focal airspace
 consolidation.  No obvious traumatic findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
