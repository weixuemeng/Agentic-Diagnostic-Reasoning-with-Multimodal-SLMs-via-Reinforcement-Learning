                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dialysis catheter has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  A mild interstitial abnormality is consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Irregularity is probably unchanged along the left humeral head; this
 appearance could be due to degenerative change but possibly avascular
 necrosis.  The right humeral head is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild pulmonary edema.
