 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___ ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates within
 the mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits for technique.  Widespread calcified pleural
 plaques are present, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure.  Additional
 pleural thickening or small effusions may account for blunting of lateral
 costophrenic sulci, left greater than right.  Linear areas of atelectasis or
 scar are present at the lung bases with otherwise grossly clear lungs.  Known
 T8 fracture is seen to better detail on separately dictated CT from the same
 date.
