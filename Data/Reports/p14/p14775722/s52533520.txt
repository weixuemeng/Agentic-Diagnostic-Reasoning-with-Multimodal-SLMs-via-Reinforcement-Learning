 assessed on same-day CT of the neck performed at an outside hospital.  There
 is mild basal atelectasis evidenced by subtle reticulonodular opacities in the
 lower lungs, difficult to exclude pneumonia.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable mediastinal prominence better assessed on same-day CT of the neck. 
 Mild bibasilar opacity likely atelectasis difficult to exclude an early
 pneumonia.
