                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DLBCL.  // Evaluate position of PICC.
 Concern for it being pulled out.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, a right PICC continues to terminate
 in the mid superior vena cava.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied
 by improved pulmonary edema.  Moderate right small to moderate left pleural
 effusions are difficult to compare to the prior exam due to positional
 differences, but there has been apparent increase in size of the right
 effusion.  Bibasilar retrocardiac opacification persists.
