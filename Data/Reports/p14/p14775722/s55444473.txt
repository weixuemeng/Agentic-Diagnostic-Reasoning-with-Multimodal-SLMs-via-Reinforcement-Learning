                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTLD, TEF fistula with Y stent with
 respiratory failure s/p intubation  // ETT placement, acute change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  The right PICC line
 is unchanged in positioning.  There are increasing multifocal bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, especially with in the right upper and mid lung, which
 likely represent aspiration.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is a probable small left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of all lines and tubes.
 2. Increasing multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely representing
 aspiration vs less likely multifocal pneumonia.
 3. Probable small left pleural effusion.
