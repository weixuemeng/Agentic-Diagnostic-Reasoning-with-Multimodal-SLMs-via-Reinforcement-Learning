                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea.  Evaluate for a pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ in ___.  CT neck ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, results in
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Bibasilar opacities are likely
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal. 
 
 Fractured sternotomy wires are again noted.  Clips overlie the neck.  The
 cervical hardware is in unchanged orientation.  A tracheostomy cannula is in
 place.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
