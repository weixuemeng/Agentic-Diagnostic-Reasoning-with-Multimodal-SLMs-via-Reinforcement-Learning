                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:16 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a tracheostomy.  Evaluate air in the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Soft tissue of the neck obscures the upper airway.  I do not see clear
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Findings questioned on the chest radiograph earlier
 today could indeed have been pneumomediastinum or alternatively air in the
 esophagus and in the right piriform sinus.  If this is a finding of serious
 concern I would recommend CT scanning.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by low lung
 volumes and mediastinal fat deposition, also lending greater caliber to the
 mediastinum, where central veins are probably also dilated.  Pulmonary
 circulation is mildly engorged, but given the very low lung volumes there is
 no convincing evidence for cardiac decompensation or pneumonia.  Pleural
 effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.
