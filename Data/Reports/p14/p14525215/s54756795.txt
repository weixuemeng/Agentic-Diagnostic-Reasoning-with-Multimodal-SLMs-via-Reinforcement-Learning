                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post tracheostomy placement. 
 Evaluate for postoperative air in chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  Heart size appears unchanged on the frontal
 view, but the patient makes a much improved deeper inspirational effort,
 resulting in optimal separation of pulmonary vasculature, showing no evidence
 of cardiovascular congestion.  The area of the tracheostomy cannula is
 unaltered and there is no conclusive evidence for any air in the surrounding
 superior mediastinal tissues.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical
 area on either side.  On the lateral view, the posterior pleural sinuses are
 free from any fluid accumulation.
 
 As before, there is evidence of two sternal wires, the most superior located
 in the manubrium, lower one at the junction between the corpus and the xiphoid
 process.  As this was a rather unusual presentation, old records were
 reviewed.  A chest CT of ___ demonstrated the presence of these
 circular wires, but showed also additional spiraling wires in the body of the
 sternum.  The latter must have been removed.  It is not clear what the purpose
 of this sternotomy was as the patient has no evidence of surgical clips or
 intracardiac prosthetic valves on the plain chest examination.  Our radiologic
 reports do not clarify this question, but clinical available notes in the
 computer do not reach back to ___.
