                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // presence of infiltrate, ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs appear relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Previously noted aneurysmal dilatation of the
 descending thoracic aorta is better assessed on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
