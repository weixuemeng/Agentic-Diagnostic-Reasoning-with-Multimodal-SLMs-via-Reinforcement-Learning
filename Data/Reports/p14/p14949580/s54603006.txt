                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The patient appears to be rotated, accentuating prominence of the mediastinum.
 Nonetheless, I suspect cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta.  No CHF.  Lucency
 in the right cardiophrenic region is noted, ? artifact due to patient's
 positioning.  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  No CHF, frank
 consolidation or gross effusion.  Possible minimal blunting of the right and
 left costophrenic angles.  Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal blunting of right and left costophrenic angle.  No
 consolidation identified.
