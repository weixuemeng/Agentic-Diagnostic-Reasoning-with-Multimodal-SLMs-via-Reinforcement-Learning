                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well expanded and clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 within normal limits.  Note is made of an old right mid clavicular fracture. 
 No displaced rib fractures are identified.  Vertebral body heights and
 alignment are maintained.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Please note that conventional radiographs are not sensitive in the assessment
 of thoracic cage abnormalities. If clinical concern persists, dedicated
 radiographs or CT chest may be obtained.
