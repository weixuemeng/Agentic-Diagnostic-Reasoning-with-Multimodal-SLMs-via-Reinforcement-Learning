                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fall and presyncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  There is a small-to-moderate pleural effusion
 on the left side with patchy parenchymal opacification.  The latter may be due
 to atelectasis although coinciding infection is possible.  On the right, there
 are similar but much less striking findings suggesting a suspected small
 effusion with patchy opacity in the adjacent right lower lobe.  There is a
 mild diffuse interstitial abnormality which is more striking along
 mid-to-lower lungs than before.  Fissures are newly thickened.  The bones are
 probably demineralized to some extent.  Small anterior osteophytes are present
 throughout most of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacification reflecting an effusion and probably
 atelectasis, but potentially pneumonia, in the left lower lobe.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
