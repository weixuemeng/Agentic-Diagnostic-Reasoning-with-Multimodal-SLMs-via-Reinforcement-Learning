                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M status post arrest, with right internal jugular line
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained 1 hr prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is unchanged in location.  Enteric tube terminates beyond
 the diaphragm.  Sternal wires are intact.  New right internal jugular central
 venous line terminates in the upper SVC, and there is a mild kink in the
 course of the catheter at the base of the neck.  The lungs demonstrate better
 inflation compared to the prior study, there is moderate pulmonary edema with
 no pleural effusions.  Heart size is enlarged, likely secondary to portable
 technique.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Appropriate position of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous line terminates in the upper SVC,
 with a mild kink in the catheter above the thoracic inlet.  Correlate for
 catheter function.
 3.  Moderate pulmonary edema and low lung volumes.
