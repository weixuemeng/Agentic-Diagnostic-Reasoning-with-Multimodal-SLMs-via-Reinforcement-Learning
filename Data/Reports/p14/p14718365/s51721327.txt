                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p PPM placement, intubated, NGT in place.  //
 Is NGT / ET tube in appropriate position?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is in place, tip lies approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  An NG
 tube is present,  difficult to trace.
 It appears to extend to the inferior edge of this film.  However, the inferior
 edge of this film lies above the expected level of the GE junction.  The side
 port likely lies immediately above the GE junction.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is similar to the prior film.  Sternotomy wires and pacemaker again
 noted.  Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Right
 cardiophrenic atelectasis is also present.  There are low lung volumes, with
 mild vascular plethora.  Small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. If clinically indicated, recommend repeat frontal chest radiograph,
 centered closer to the diaphragms, to better assess the position of the NG
 tube.  On the current film, the tip appears to extend to the inferior edge of
 the film, which itself likely corresponds the level of the GE junction.
 2. Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 3. Probable CHF, similar to the prior film, though this appearance may be
 accentuated by slightly low lung volumes.
