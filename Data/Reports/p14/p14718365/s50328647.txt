                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest. now with PPM placed  // cxr
 to eval ppm placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is rotated positioning and the lower left chest wall is excluded from
 the film.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Of note, the battery pack itself is excluded from these
 films and the contiguity with the pacemaker wires cannot be confirmed on this
 examination.  No additional pacing device is appreciated on this view, but
 correlation with specifics of the clinical scenario is requested.
 
 The carina is not well visualized, but the ET tube appears to lie
 approximately 5.4 cm above the carina.  There appears to be an NG tube
 present, but it cannot be traced below the level of the diaphragm.
 Interruption of the uppermost sternal wire again noted.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, probably similar to the prior film,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The presence
 of a left effusion is difficult to assess due to positioning.
 
 Hazy density in the right lung suggests the presence of mild vascular
 plethora.  No definite right effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base
 is similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pacemaker lead tips over right atrium can right ventricle, but the battery
 pack and more proximal portion of the wires are excluded from the film.  If
 clinically indicated, a repeat frontal film could be used to include both the
 battery pack and lead tips on the same film.  If an additional pacing device
 is present, then an additional film would be required to demonstrate it.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation unchanged.
 3. Mild vascular plethora/ CHF is likely similar to the prior film.
 4. NG tube tip does not clearly pass below the level of the lower mediastinum.
