 No significant interval change. The ETT tip is approximately 8 cm from the

 apparent kinks unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are unchanged, including a
 break in the upper most aspect.  Low lung volumes persist.  The heart is
 probably enlarged, overall similar.  No pneumothorax.  Left lung atelectasis
 is worse.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ETT is high and could be advanced further at least 2 cm to avoid
 inadvertent extubation.
