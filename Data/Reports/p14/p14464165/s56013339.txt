 HISTORY:  Pre-operative for thoracic aneurysm repair with recent emesis, to
 assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Cardiac silhouette remains prominent.  However, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion has substantially improved.  Mild residual opacification at the
 left base suggests a small effusion and atelectasis.
