                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are normal in appearance.  Left lung is slightly
 more lucent but clear.  Right apical scarring and cavity is re-demonstrated. 
 Right mid lung opacity corresponds to the areas of infection seen in the
 superior segment of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, although as
 compared to the prior study appears to be slightly more prominent and might
 reflect interval flare of infectious process.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.   
 
 Followup of the patient four weeks after completion of antibiotic treatment is
 recommended.
