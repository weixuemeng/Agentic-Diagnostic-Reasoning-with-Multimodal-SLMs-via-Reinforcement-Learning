                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size remains normal.  Mediastinal contours are remarkable for
 a focal convexity of the left upper mediastinal contour just above the level
 of the aortic knob.  Review of prior CTA of the chest of ___
 demonstrates a focal soft tissue abnormality in this region, possibly related
 to the thymus gland.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear, and there are no
 acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal left mediastinal contour abnormality, which may correspond
 to an area of thymic tissue on previous CTA of the chest of ___.  It
 is uncertain whether this represents asymmetrical residual thymus tissue or a
 thymic epithelial neoplasm.  Recommend a chest CT to allow more accurate
 comparison to the prior CT of the chest of ___, as entered into the
 radiology communications dashboard on ___.
