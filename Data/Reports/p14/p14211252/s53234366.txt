                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post CABG.  Evaluate for pneumothorax
 after chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube, left pleural
 tube, two mediastinal drains, and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed. 
 Sternotomy wires appear intact.  A tiny left pneumothorax is slightly smaller
 than on ___.  A right apical linear density with peripheral
 lucency may represent a new small right pneumothorax.  Atelectasis at the left
 base is more pronounced, as expected post-extubation.  No focal consolidation
 or pleural effusion.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right apical linear density which may represent a small new pneumothorax. 
 A repeat chest radiograph in true upright position is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 2.  Status post extubation and left pleural drain removal with tiny residual
 left pneumothorax and left base atelectasis.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ at
 1415pm on ___, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
