                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement of the
 pre-existing left parenchymal opacity. The opacity has decreased in size and
 is now located more cranially, but the basal components have resolved.
 However, there is a new focal parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe,
 likely reflecting a new focus of infection. Otherwise the lung is unchanged.
 No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.  The position of the Dobbhoff catheter is
 constant.
