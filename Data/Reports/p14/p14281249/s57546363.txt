                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ ___ ___'s disease with large right frontal mass and
 midline shift with acute altered mental status. Status post craniotomy and
 resection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena
 cava. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The lung volumes are low.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Minimal opacities
 at each lung base suggest minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear. High density material in the visualized transverse and splenic flexure
 portions of the colon suggests a recent prior contrast administration for a
 radiologic study. Small quantity of hyperdense material at the base of the
 right lung may represent trace prior aspiration of barium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
