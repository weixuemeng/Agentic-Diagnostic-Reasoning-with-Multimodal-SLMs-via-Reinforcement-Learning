                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status x1 day
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Punctate
 calcification in the lung bases along with coarse reticular opacities are
 again noted, potentially due to chronic aspiration.  Increased retrocardiac
 patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Scarring within the lung apices
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased patchy retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, without focal
 consolidation.  Unchanged coarse reticular bibasilar opacities with punctate
 calcifications, findings which may be due to chronic aspiration.
