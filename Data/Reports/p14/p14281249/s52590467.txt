                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Hilar contours remain prominent and may reflect underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  Increased opacities are seen in the left mid lung field,
 right perihilar region, and left lung base.  Previously noted nodules seen on
 prior CT are not well assessed on current radiograph.  Increased interstitial
 opacities in the right lung base with associated punctate calcifications may
 be due to sequela of previous aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is noted within the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening left mid lung field, right perihilar and left basilar airspace
 opacities which may reflect multifocal pneumonia.
