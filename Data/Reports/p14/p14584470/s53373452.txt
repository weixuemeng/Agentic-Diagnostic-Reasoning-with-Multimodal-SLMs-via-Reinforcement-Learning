                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular venous catheter has been removed.  The
 patient is status post apparently mitral valve replacement.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There
 is persistent fluid in the minor fissure, but somewhat decreased.  A small
 quantity of fluid is similar in the right major fissure.  However, there is a
 new suspected small pleural effusion on the left with patchy associated
 basilar opacity and there is also increased opacification at the right lung
 base.  There is no overt congestive heart failure.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bibasilar opacification with a small new left-sided pleural
 effusion.  These findings are not specific and could be seen with atelectasis
 but developing pulmonary infection is not excluded.
