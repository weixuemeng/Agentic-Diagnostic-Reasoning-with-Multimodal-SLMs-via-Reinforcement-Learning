                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation in a patient
 with severe pulmonary hypertension.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Replaced mitral and tricuspid valves are
 redemonstrated.  Bilateral right more than left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 Right lower lobe consolidation has slightly improved and might be consistent
 with resolution of atelectasis or pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema
 is seen on the current radiograph, but mild vascular congestion is present.
