                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (PA and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with chest pain and general weakness
 status-post fall.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP
 diameter.  There is mild right middle lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs
 are clear.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The heart
 is top-normal in size. The ascending and descending aorta are slightly
 tortuous or ectatic.  The mediastinum and hila are unremarkable.  There is
 diffuse bony demineralization.  Mild degenerative changes are noted throughout
 the thoracic spine with loss of intervertebral disc height and endplate
 sclerosis.  Anterior compression deformity of mid-thoracic vertebral body
 appears chronic (approximately ___% loss of vertebral body height).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs and other findings may suggest chronic pulmonary
 disease, but non-specific.
 3.  Top-normal heart size.
 4.  Anterior compression deformity of mid-thoracic vertebral body appears
 chronic.
