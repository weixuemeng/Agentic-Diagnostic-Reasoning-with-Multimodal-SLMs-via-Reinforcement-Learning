                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the
 prior study, there has been interval development of a large rounded posterior
 left upper lobe mass, measuring in the order of at least 9.1 x 7.0 cm rounded
 opacity highly concerning for underlying pulmonary malignancy.  There is left
 paratracheal soft tissue thickening/opacity with rightward deviation/mass
 effect upon the trachea.  Right infrahilar opacity noted on the prior study is
 stable.  The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  In addition to the large left upper lobe opacity, there
 are areas of multiple reticulonodular opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung
 which may represent vascular structures; however, further extent of malignancy
 or infection is not excluded.  Left apical opacity above the rounded opacity
 may be related to malignancy with possible small pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 There may be a very small nodular opacity projecting over the posterior right
 sixth rib, which can also be further evaluated on chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of large posterior left upper lobe rounded
 opacity with left paratracheal thickening and with mass effect and rightward
 deviation of the trachea, highly worrisome for malignancy.  Findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:05 p.m. on ___.  Additional
 subtle reticular nodular opacities projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung
 may relate to vascular structures, although underlying disease spread or
 infection are not excluded.
 
 COPD.
 
 Possible small left apical pleural effusion.
