                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with episodes of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  A paired tubular structure superimposed
 upon the left mid-lung is noted of uncertain significance. The cardiac
 silhouette is normal, the mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A paired tubular structure superimposed upon the left mid-lung is
 noted of uncertain significance. While this may be a normal vascular variant,
 further evaluation with contrast enhanced CT chest is recommended.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 5:15pm.
