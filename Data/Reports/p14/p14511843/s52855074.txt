                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening cough and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relatively
 linear left mid lung opacity is felt to more likely represent atelectasis
 rather than consolidation.  The visualized right lung is clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively linear left mid lung opacity is felt to represent
 atelectasis/scarring rather than consolidation.
