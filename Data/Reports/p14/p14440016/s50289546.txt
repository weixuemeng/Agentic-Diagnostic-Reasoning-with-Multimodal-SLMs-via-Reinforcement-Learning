                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, right chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
 present, and the lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There is mild deformity to
 the left eighth lateral rib, suggestive of a remote fracture.  No acutely
 displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality or acutely displaced rib
 fracture is noted.  If there is continued clinical concern for a rib fracture,
 then a dedicated rib series is recommended.
