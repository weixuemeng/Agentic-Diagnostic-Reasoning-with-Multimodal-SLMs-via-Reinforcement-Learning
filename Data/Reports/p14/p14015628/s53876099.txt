                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and portable chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is diffuse basilar predominant
 honeycombing consistent with patient's underlying history of UIP.  Focal
 nodular opacities with a subpleural distribution in the lung apices are more
 prominent on the current examination as compared to prior chest radiograph,
 though appear similar to scout image from recent chest CT from ___. 
 Scarring and calcifications in the upper lungs are stable and consistent with
 history of prior TB exposure.  No acute consolidation is identified.  There is
 no evidence of superimposed pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe chronic lung disease without evidence of superimposed
 consolidation or edema.
