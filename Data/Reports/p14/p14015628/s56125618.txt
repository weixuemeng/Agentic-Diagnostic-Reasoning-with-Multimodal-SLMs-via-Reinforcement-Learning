                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest CTA from ___
 and portable chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is diffuse basilar
 predominant honeycombing consistent with patient's underlying history of UIP. 
 Focal nodular opacities, calcifications and fibrotic changes within the upper
 lobes are similar to prior examination and are consistent with patient's
 history of prior tuberculosis exposure.  No acute confluent consolidation is
 identified.  There is no evidence of superimposed pulmonary edema.  No large
 pleural effusion is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe underlying chronic lung disease without evidence of
 superimposed consolidation or edema.
