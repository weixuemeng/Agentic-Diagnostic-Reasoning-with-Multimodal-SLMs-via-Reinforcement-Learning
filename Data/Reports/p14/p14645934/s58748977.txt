                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cycling fevers.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality, which is
 nonspecific.  There is no significant fullness of the bilateral hila,
 suggesting it is unlikely to be related to pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation.  There may be a small amount of fissural fluid seen on
 the lateral view. No large pleural effusion is seen. Mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality, which in the setting of fevers, could
 represent an atypical infection, such as a virus or PCP.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Possible small amount of fissural fluid seen on the
 lateral view.
