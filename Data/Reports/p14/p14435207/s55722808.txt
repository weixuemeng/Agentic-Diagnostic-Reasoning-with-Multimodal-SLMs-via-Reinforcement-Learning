                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for edema, effusion, or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs which are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation, vascular congestion, effusion, or pneumothorax. A nodular
 opacity in the right lower lung likely represents a calcified granuloma. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
