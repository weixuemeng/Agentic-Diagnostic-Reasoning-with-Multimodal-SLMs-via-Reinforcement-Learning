                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with toxic appearance, hyperbilirubinemia, concern
 for cholangitis, oxygen requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes.  Hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis with more confluent in
 the left lung base concerning for superimposed infection or aspiration.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Several chronic
 appearing left-sided rib deformities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis with more focal opacity in
 the left lung base concerning for infection or aspiration.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
