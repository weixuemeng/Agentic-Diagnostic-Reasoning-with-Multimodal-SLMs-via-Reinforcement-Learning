                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Current fatigue.  Any worrisome lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 Heart size top normal.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement, edema or pleural
 effusion.  Lateral view shows contours projecting over the anterior aspect of
 the heart that could be mediastinal fat or pleural thickening.  but could also
 be a lung lesion.  I would recommend routine oblique views to exclude the
 possibility of a subtle lung mass.  No evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement.
