                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic cancer, elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Large
 opacification in the right upper hemithorax/right upper lobe is stable,
 consistent with patient's known large right upper lobe mass with right upper
 airway obstruction.  There is mild left base atelectasis.  No new focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Again seen large right upper lung opacity consistent with known
 underlying large mass with right upper airway obstruction.
