                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cardiomyopathy and crackles in the bilateral bases on
 lung exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate linear opacities in the lower
 lungs, likely representing atelectasis.  No opacity convincing for pneumonia
 is seen.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle appears to been present on prior study, may
 reflect pleural thickening.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  There is no air under the right in diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise unremarkable.
