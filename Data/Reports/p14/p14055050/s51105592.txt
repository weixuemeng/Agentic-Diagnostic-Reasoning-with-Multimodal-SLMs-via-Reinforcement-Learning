   ET tube has been advanced and is now 5.8 cm from the carina.  No other
  significant change. Low lung volumes with persistent left basilar
  consolidation, likely a combination of pleural fluid and an opacitiy, possibly
  aspiration of atelectasis.  In the proper clinical setting, pneumonia is also
  a possibility.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible high endotracheal tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube is now approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  Otherwise,
 little change.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacifications more prominent
 on the left, which most likely represents combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
