 FINDINGS:  There is mild retrocardiac atelectasis otherwise, the lungs are
 clear with no evidence of consolidations, effusions, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are identified.
 There is slight tortunosity of the aorta. An old right lateral eight rib
 fracture is noted. Additionally, there is widening of the Acromio-Clavicular
 interval to 18mm suggestive of dissociation. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is widening of the acromio-clavicular joint to 18mm which
 is suggestive of dissociation but may be chronic. There is also evidence of an
