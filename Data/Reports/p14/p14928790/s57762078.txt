                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker, to assess lead position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is now a dual-channel
 pacemaker in place with the leads in the region of the right atrium and apex
 of the right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette is more prominent, though some of
 this may merely reflect the lower lung volumes.  Indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels raises the possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases and there is a somewhat hazy quality
 that could reflect layering effusion.  No evidence of post-procedure
 pneumothorax.  The prior healing rib fracture on the left is again seen.
