                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post thymectomy, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous portable study of ___ at
 ___.
 
 A portable chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.  As the patient's
 position is not indicated, this is likely study that was obtained in the
 supine position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and left subclavian central line unchanged in position. 
 Bilateral mediastinal drains remain in place.  Overall stable post-operative
 cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Persistent patchy opacity at the right base and retrocardiac
 consolidation most likely represent atelectasis in the setting of layering
 effusions.  However, there is hyperlucency within both costophrenic angles
 which could reflect bilateral anterior pneumothoraces.  Clinical correlation
 is advised and if this is of concern, further imaging with an upright or
 decubitus study might be helpful.  There is stable subcutaneous emphysema
 within the chest wall musculature.
