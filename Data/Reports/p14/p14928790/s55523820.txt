 REASON FOR EXAM:  Abnormal ECG after thymectomy.  Assess for pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiac size normal.  Multiple
 surgical clips project in the left upper mediastinum.  Transvenous pacemaker
 leads terminate in standard position, in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger
 on the left side, have minimally increased with adjacent atelectasis.  Lung
 nodules seen in prior CT from ___ are below the resolution of these
 radiographs.  Bilateral mid healing rib fractures are noted.
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.
 
 Sternal wires are aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in size of small bilateral pleural effusions.
