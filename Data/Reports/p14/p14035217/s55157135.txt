 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little overall
 change in the postoperative appearance of the right hemithorax. No evidence of
 pneumothorax. There are loculated regions of gas in the right apex and right
 base anteriorly, presumably postoperative. The left lung is essentially clear
 with mild basilar atelectatic changes.
