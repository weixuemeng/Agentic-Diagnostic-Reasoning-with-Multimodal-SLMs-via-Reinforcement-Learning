                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph six and a half hours prior.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are improved.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no frank
 pulmonary edema. Rightward deviation of the cervical trachea reflects known
 goiter.
