                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis in a patient status post laparoscopic total
 abdominal colectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There are linear opacities in the left lower lobe,
 likely secondary to atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. The heart
 size is normal. There is rightward deviation of the upper trachea raising
 concern for thyromegaly.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes and left lower lobe atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
 2. Rightward deviation of the upper thoracic trachea is suggestive of
 thyromegaly.
