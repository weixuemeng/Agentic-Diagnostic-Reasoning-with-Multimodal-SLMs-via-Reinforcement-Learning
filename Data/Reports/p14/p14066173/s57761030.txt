                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent post-op status post colectomy with hypoxia to ___% and
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are significantly lower and there is bibasilar
 atalectasis.  Right infrahilar atalectasis is mild.  Heart size is exaggerated
 by low lung volumes and AP technique and is likely normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Rightward deviation of the cervical trachea
 reflects known goiter. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar atalectasis less likely pneumonia.
