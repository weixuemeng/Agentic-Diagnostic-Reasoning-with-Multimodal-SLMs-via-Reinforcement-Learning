                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST OF ___ WITH NO PRIOR RADIOGRAPHS FOR
 COMPARISON
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Heart
 is upper limits of normal in size.  Lungs are remarkable for a possible 1 cm
 diameter nodule in the right upper lobe, difficult to localize and
 characterize on this single portable view.  The patient has had a neck CT on
 ___, but this did not extend to this level.  It did, however,
 demonstrate extensive pulmonary emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
 2.  Possible right upper lobe lung nodule.  Recommend initial confirmation
 with standard PA and lateral chest radiographs.  If confirmed, CT would be
 recommended for further assessment.  
 
 Dr. ___ has been notified by telephone of this result at 4 p.m. on
