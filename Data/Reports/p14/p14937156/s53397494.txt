  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube through existing stoma, terminating
  in the left mainstem bronchus, with associated partial collapse of the right
  lung, and rightward shift of the mediastinum.
  
  NOTE: At the time of interpretation, a subsequent radiograph time stamped
  20:22 was already obtained, which demonstrates interval repositioning of the
  endotracheal tube in the midtrachea with re-expansion of the right lung and
  improved rightward midline shift.
