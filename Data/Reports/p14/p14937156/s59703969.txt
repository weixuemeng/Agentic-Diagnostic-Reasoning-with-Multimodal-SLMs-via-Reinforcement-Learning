 eval for pneumonia, aspiration, atelectasis

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 07:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities are again seen which could reflect areas of chronic
 scarring or atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration cannot
 be entirely excluded. If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging
 should be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.  The
 face mask obscures the lung apices. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable given patient rotation.  No pleural effusions.
