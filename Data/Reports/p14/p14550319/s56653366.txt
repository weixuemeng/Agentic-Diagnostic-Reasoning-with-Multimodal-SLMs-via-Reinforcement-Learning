                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Relative sites opacity projecting over the lung bases bilaterally is likely
 due to overlying soft tissue.  No correlate is seen on the lateral views.  No
 definite focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a mild
 atelectasis at the lateral left lung base and a very trace left pleural
 effusion is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There may be a
 hiatal hernia.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal lateral left base atelectasis with possible very trace pleural
 effusion although no large pleural effusion seen.  No focal consolidation.
