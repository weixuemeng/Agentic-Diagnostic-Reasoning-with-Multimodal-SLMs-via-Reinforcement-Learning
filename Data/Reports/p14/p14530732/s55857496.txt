                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-tracheal stent placement, check position of stent.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ in conjunction with CT
 trachea from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A stent is seen overlying the trachea extending from the superior
 margin of C7 to the superior aspect of T2 vertebral bodies.  A sharply
 marginated opacity projecting over the mid thorax may be external to the
 patient, recommend repeating radiograph ensuring that nothing is obscuring the
 patient. Otherwise, no significant change from prior with no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax and stable appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheal stent overlies C7 and T1 vertebral bodies.
 2.  Sharply marginated opacity over the mid thorax likely external to the
 patient, recommend repeating the radiograph ensuring that nothing is obscuring
 the patient.
