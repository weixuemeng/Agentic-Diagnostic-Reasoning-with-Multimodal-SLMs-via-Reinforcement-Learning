 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild perihilar
 peribronchial cuffing which could indicate a reactive airways inflammatory
 process.  Please correlate clinically.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peribronchial thickening, which is seen diffusely and could
 reflect bronchial inflammation.  Correlate clinically.  No lobar
 consolidation.
