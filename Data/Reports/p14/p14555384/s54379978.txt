                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chest pain, cough and sputum,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is of the upper limit of normal variation.  There is relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left, a finding which
 suggests mild enlargement of the left ventricle.  There is, however, no
 conclusive evidence for left atrial enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  The
 thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated, but no local contour
 abnormalities are seen.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates on either
 side and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  Surgical
 clips are identified in the right upper abdominal quadrant indicative of
 previous cholecystectomy.  Additional surgical clips overlying left upper abd.
 area indicative of previous hiatal hernia repair.
 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, two at that time suspected nodular lesions in the left upper lobe area
 cannot be identified.  They were already excluded by a chest CT examination of
 ___.
 
 CT examination also shows that the patient was status post left-sided
 nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma which explains the described densities in
 the left upper quadrant area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiac enlargement with cardiac configuration suggestive of
 systemic hypertension but no signs of acute failure, pulmonary congestion, or
 acute infiltrates.  No pleural effusions.
