                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tachycardia, evaluate for infiltrate. 
 Additionally, he has a known left calcaneal fracture.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes, and there
 is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Airspace opacity in the right lower
 lung may reflect atelectasis or focal consolidation favoring the latter. 
 There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size, accentuated by low volumes.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal. Scoliosis may be positional.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes, with airspace opacity which could represent hemorrhage,
 contusion, or pneumonia, or less likely atelectasis; recommend repeat views
 with better chest expansion.
 
 2. Scoliosis may be positional, recommend clinical correlation for back pain.
