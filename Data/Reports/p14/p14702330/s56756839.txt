                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post AAA repair with bilateral effusions. 
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 worsening of pulmonary edema since the prior study.  There is also minimal, if
 any, increase in bilateral pleural effusions since the prior study.  The heart
 size is stable.  The right upper lobe is better aerated since the prior study.
 The endotracheal tube appears to have been retracted apprximately three
 centimeters since the prior study, now terminating 7.7 cm above the carina. 
 Otherwise, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in opacities in the bilateral lower lung zones,
 likely due to worsening pulmonary edema, along with minimal, if any, increase
 in bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube terminates 7.7 cm
 above the carina and could be advanced 2-3 cm. 
 
 The above findings communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 10:41 a.m., one minute after discovery.
