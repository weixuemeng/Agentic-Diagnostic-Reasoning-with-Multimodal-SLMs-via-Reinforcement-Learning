                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough, evaluate for infectious process or
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified are sternotomy wires.  There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for
 this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Prominent pulmonary
 vessels and diffuse interstitial prominence is likely a combination of
 crowding of normal bronchovascular structures and pulmonary venous congestion
 without overt edema.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, however
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, however cannot exclude
 superimposed infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Very low lung volumes and crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.
 3. Pulmonary venous congestion without overt edema.
