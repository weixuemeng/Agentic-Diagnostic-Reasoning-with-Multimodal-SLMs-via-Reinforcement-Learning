                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, fever  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires again
 noted.  Lung volumes are low.  Interstitial opacities are increased from prior
 which could represent an atypical pneumonia versus interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are similar.  Mild hilar
 congestion likely present.  Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes
 at the AC joints noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly, likely mild interstitial edema.  Difficult to exclude an
 atypical infection
