 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left pigtail catheter
 has been removed.  There is relative lucency in the left apex, though an

 pneumothorax.
 Substantial subcutaneous gas is again seen along the left lateral chest wall.
 No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
