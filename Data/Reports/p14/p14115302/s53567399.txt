                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxia, being treated for pneumonia,
 also with CHF  // assess for interval change      assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate
 cardiomegaly are little changed.  The lung bases lobe better aerated, less
 likely to be pneumonia or even appreciable atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 The transvenous right atrial lead is oriented more medially than usual.  A
 lateral view would be helpful to determine that it is directed toward the
 anterior wall of the right atrium.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer
 defibrillator lead is nearly at the cardiac apex.
