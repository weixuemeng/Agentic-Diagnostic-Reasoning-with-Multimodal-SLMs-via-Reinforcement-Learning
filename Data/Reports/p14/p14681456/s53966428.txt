                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // Pneumonia, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is slight
 upward retraction of the hila bilaterally, unchanged.  Pleural parenchymal
 scarring within the lung apices with calcified nodules is similar compared to
 the previous exam, and likely reflective of prior granulomatous disease. Lungs
 remain hyperinflated. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified. There is no pulmonary edema. Several clips are demonstrated
 within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic changes within the lung apices compatible with prior granulomatous
 disease. No new areas of focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No
 pneumothorax.
