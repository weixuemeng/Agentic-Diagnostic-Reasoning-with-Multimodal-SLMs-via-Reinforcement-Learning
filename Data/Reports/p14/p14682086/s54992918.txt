  1. Increased opacities bilaterally could represent mild pulmonary edema, as
  well as increased atelectasis secondary to a gas distended large hiatal
  hernia.
  2. Likely increased small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB, hypoxia?  // volume overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous study from earlier the same date, congestive heart
 failure with mild to moderate pulmonary edema is new. Asymmetrically
 distributed right basilar consolidation could reflect asymmetrical edema or
 secondary process such as aspiration.  Bilateral pleural effusions are a
 persistent finding, and note is again made of a massive hiatal hernia.
