                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man found down, unable to provide history.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild streaky
 right basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no evidence of focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Asymmetric soft tissue opacity inferior to the
 medial right clavicle may simply be due to summation of tissues.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The thoracic aorta is calcified
 and tortuous, with mild rightward effect on the mid to distal trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes without focal consolidation.
 
 2.  There is asymmetric soft tissue opacity inferior to the medial right
 clavicle.  While this may be due to summation of normal structures, it is
 recommended that the patient return for apical lordotic radiograph for further
 evaluation in order to exclude a pulmonary nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  At the time of the updated read, the patient had already been
 discharged.  Therefore, the information and recommendation in impression point
 #2 were emailed to the ED QA nurses at 08:03 on ___, for communication
 to the patient.
