                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray and rib views.
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided rib pain.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Patient has a focal opacity projected below the ninth rib posteriorly in the
 left mid zone, a little medial and superior for a nipple shadow and likely
 identified in the lateral view anteriorly.  This is quite dense, significance
 of which is uncertain.  It may reflect a sebaceous cyst or some additional
 findings, it was not definitively identified on prior radiographs from
 ___.
 
 ___ views are normal.  No rib fractures are seen.  No pneumothorax.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Well  opacified nodule projected on multiple views.  Uncertain significance of
 this.  Correlation with skin examination might be useful as it certainly could
 represent a sebaceous cyst.  Repeat with skin markers would also be useful-
 otherwise a non-contrast targeted CT examination for further evaluation might
 be useful.
