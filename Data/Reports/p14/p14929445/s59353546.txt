                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with elevated white blood cell count and dizziness. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Reference chest radiograph of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate nincreased lung
 volumes suggestive of underlying emphysema.  There is no pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Right lung base opacities obscure right
 hemidiaphragm medially, which most likely represent atelectasis and/or
 scarring.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased lung volumes suggestive of underlying emphysema.  Right
 lung linear opacities likely represent atelectasis and/or scarring.
