                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Back pain and severe spinal stenosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The arch is partly calcified. 
 The heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There is mild loss in height of a lower thoracic vertebral body
 that appears chronic, although new since the remote prior radiographs.  A mild
 anterior wedge compression deformity of T12 is better depicted on a CT from
 the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
