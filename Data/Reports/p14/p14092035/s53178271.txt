                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with proximal muscle weakness and fever,
 question interstitial lung disease, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:50
 p.m.
 
 AP and lateral imaging of the chest was performed.  The lateral is somewhat
 suboptimal as the patient was unable to raise her arm over her head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs
 appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural
 effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No specific plain film
 radiographic evidence for interstitial lung disease, although a chest CT would
 be more sensitive to detect this type of abnormality.  Degenerative changes in
 the mid thoracic spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
