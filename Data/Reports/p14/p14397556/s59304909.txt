                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new-onset fevers, cough, and extreme
 fatigue, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest with an additional frontal
 view are obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an irregular, rounded density projecting over the right
 heart border at the level of the posterior ninth rib on the frontal radiograph
 with an unclear correlate on the corresponding lateral view in the right lower
 lobe.  There is also irregular thickening of the pleura involving the right
 apex along the lateral border adjacent to the right shoulder.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  No skeletal abnormalities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Irregular rounded density projecting over the right heart border
 and irregular pleural thickening involving the lateral right apex are unclear
 in etiology.  A followup CT or short-interval chest radiograph is recommended
 for further evaluation.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at
 3:12 p.m. on ___.
