                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stage IV breast cancer with lung metastases and malignant pleural
 effusion on the left, presenting with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava, similar to prior findings.
 Surgical clips project over the right breast. The right lung remains clear but
 there is increasing opacification of the left hemithorax, probably for the
 most part associated with increase in a suspected large pleural effusion on
 that side.  Previously there was a small hydropneumothorax that is no longer
 apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the left hemithorax suggesting primarily increase
 in pleural effusion.
