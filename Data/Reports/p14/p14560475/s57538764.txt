                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New stroke.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lobulation of the both hemidiaphragms is
 better appreciated on the PA view.
