 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:22 PM
  Persistent severe bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities, concerning for edema,
  with slight increase at the bases, left greater than right, with possible
  slightly increased left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with worsening
 respiratory distress.  Assess for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___ at 10:38.  Multiple chest
 radiographs dating to ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam performed approximately nine hours earlier,
 there has been progression of the diffuse bilateral infiltrates with
 underlying nodules.  This is most concerning for worsening infection. 
 Underlying edema or hemorrhage remain a consideration.  A denser opacity at
 the left base appears stable and likely relates to a known metastasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapid progression of bilateral nodular infiltrates is most likely
 due to infection.  Other considerations include underlying edema or
 hemorrhage.  The known scattered pulmonary metastases are not well evaluated.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ (SICU resident) at 10:57 a.m. on
 ___ via telephone by Dr. ___.
