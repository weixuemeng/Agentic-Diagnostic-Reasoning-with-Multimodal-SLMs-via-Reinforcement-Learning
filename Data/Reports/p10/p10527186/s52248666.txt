                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with known metastases to the
 lungs.  New shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been progression of bilateral
 diffuse patchy opacities, most marked in the left peripheral mid and lower
 lung zones.  Given the rapid progression, this is most consistent with new
 edema.  Alternatively, could be due to infection, a toxic or allergic drug
 reaction or hemorrhage.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The heart size is stable.  Surgical
 clips are noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing bilateral diffuse opacities most concerning for new
 edema.  Alternatively, could be due to infection, a toxic or allergic drug
 reaction or hemorrhage.
