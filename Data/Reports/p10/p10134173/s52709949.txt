                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Three episodes of pre syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy left basilar opacity
 likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Partially
 imaged is a right shoulder arthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
