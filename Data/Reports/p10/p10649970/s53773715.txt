 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tachypnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval resolution of interstitial pulmonary edema.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Calcified nodular opacities projecting over the right lower lobe are
 redemonstrated, most likely representing calcified pulmonary nodules.
