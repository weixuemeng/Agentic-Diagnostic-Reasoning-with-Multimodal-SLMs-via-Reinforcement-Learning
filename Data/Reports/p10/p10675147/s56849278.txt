 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest. There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  2 discrete nodular opacities are seen projecting
 over the left mid lung adjacent to the left heart border likely representing
 prominent costochondral calcification.  However, pulmonary nodules difficult
 to exclude.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or edema.  Nodular structures in the left mid lung
 likely prominent costochondral calcification though difficult to exclude
 pulmonary nodule.  If there are elevated risk factors, consider nonemergent
 chest CT to further assess.
