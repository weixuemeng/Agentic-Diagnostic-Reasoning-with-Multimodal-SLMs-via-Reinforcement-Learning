                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest discomfort, confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Nerve stimulator pack is seen projecting over the right chest wall with lead
 coursing cephalad into the right neck.  Additionally, leads from a nerve
 stimulator device within the posterior lower back terminates at the level of
 the upper thoracic spine.  There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities possibly reflecting
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
