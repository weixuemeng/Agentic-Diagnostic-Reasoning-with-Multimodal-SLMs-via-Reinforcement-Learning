                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing
 for slightly greater lung volumes on the current study compared to the prior. 
 Improving aeration at the right lung base with residual patchy opacity, likely
 due to patchy atelectasis.  Minor atelectasis is also demonstrated in the left
 retrocardiac area.  No new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia, and no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
