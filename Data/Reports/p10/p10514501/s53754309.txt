                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p pleurodesis for recurrent ptx, now w/ chest
 tubes removed.  // Assess for interval PTX.     Assess for interval PTX.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 14:15 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the right chest tubes.  No pleural line is seen to suggest
 a significant pneumothorax.  However, there are focal lucencies in the lower
 medial right lung base and at the right apex which could reflect loculated
 air.  This can be better assessed on followup imaging. Hazy opacity at the
 right base is stable and likely reflects a combination of postsurgical change
 and atelectasis in this patient status post right VATS pleurodesis and
 diaphragmatic repair.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 pulmonary edema.
