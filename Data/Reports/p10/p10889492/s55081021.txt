 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bronchospasm, wheezes and rhonchi, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 unremarkable.  On the right, the hilar structures are normal.  On the left,
 the hilus is minimally enlarged and the contours are unsharp.  The left hilus
 is also surrounded by a minimal increase in interstitial structures.  If
 clinically relevant, this finding, potentially suggesting a chronic infectious
 change, should be further clarified by CT.
 
 No evidence of acute pulmonary disease.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.
