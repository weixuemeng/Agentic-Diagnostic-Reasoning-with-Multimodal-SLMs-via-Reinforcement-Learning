                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bladder cancer with temperature.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD.  There is mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The aortais calcified and slightly unfolded.   Possible mild
 prominence of hila raising quesiton of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  Increased opacities at
 the right lung base are seen.  Streaky opacities at the left lung base are
 also seen, but are s omewhat more likely secondary to atelectasis.  There is a
 probable small right pleural effusion.  There is no large pneumothorax.
 Suspect old healed fxs of the left ___ and 8th ribs. Degenerative changes
 noted in the cervical and thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) COPD.
 2) Mild to moderate cardiomegally. 
 3) Increased opacity at the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.
 Changes at the left base could be due to atelectasis, but could also represent
 an early pneumonic infiltrate.  Probable small right effusion.
