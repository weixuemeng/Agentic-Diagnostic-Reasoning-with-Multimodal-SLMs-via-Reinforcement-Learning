                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with facial swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low and cause crowding of the pulmonary
 vascular markings.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted, greatest in the left base.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The lungs are otherwise without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No free air is noted under the
 hemidiaphragms.  No acute fractures are identified. Cholecystectomy clips are
 noted in the right upper quadrant. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, however, pneumonia must
 be excluded in the proper clinical setting.  No acute cardiopulmonary process
 otherwise.
