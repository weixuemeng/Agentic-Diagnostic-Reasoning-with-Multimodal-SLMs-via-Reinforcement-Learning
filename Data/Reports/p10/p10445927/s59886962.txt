 The right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  A left
 mediastinal drain and catheter are unchanged in position. The patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  A lucency outlining the aortic knob and AP
 window suggests pneumomediastinum which would be an expected finding in this
 recently postoperative patient.  Heart remains stable in size. The lungs are
 without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions. No definite pneumothorax is seen.
