                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tSAH, admitted to ICU for respiratory
 distress. Received ___ IV lasix yesterday. // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 09:00.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube traverses the midline.  Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC. 
 Surgical hardware in the thoracic spine projects over the mid thorax and
 limits evaluation of underlying structures.  Aeration of the lungs has
 improved but lung volumes remain low.  Bilateral atelectasis persists.  No
 definite pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size, unchanged.  Minimal
 bilateral edema.  No pneumothorax. Opacity projecting over the right upper
 lung likely reflects prior rib injury.  Gaseous distention of the colon in the
 left upper quadrant is similar to previous exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration lungs with residual minimal edema.
