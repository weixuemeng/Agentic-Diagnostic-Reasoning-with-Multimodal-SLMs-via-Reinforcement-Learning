                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina, and left
 PICC terminates in the expected region of the junction of the superior vena
 cava and right atrium.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Asymmetrical perihilar opacities
 are present, worse on the left than the right.  This probably represents a
 combination of pulmonary edema and left lung pneumonia.  New linear band-like
 atelectasis has developed in the right lower lobe.
