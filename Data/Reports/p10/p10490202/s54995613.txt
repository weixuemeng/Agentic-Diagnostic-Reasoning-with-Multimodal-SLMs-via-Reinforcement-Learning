                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Found down.  Evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately
 5.3 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with
 the tip out of field of view.  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are
 lower.  Mild pulmonary edema has worsened.  There is persistent opacification
 of the left mid and lower lung zones, likely pneumonia or aspiration.  There
 is no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged left mid and lower lung zone opacity, likely due to pneumonia or
 aspiration.
 2.  Slight worsening of mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube.
