                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema or ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube and enteric tube are present in standard positions.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Slight enlargement of pulmonary vasculature is seen.  Overall the
 lung opacities do look improved, however there is persistent opacification of
 the left mid lung zone.  While this may represent pulmonary edema, its
 asymmetry is unusual, unless a gravitational/positional component is
 responsible.  As the right lung is clear, ARDS is excluded as a diagnosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Persistent left mid lung zone opacity most consistent with aspiration
 pneumonia.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema is still possible.
 2. ARDS excluded as the right lung is clear.
