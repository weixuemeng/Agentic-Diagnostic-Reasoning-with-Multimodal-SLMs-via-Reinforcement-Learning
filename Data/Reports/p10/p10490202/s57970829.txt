                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated with altered mental status.  Assess tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates in the midtrachea 4.9 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach and out of view.  The lungs are low in volume with
 bilateral perihilar opacities which could reflect edema and more confluent
 retrocardiac opacity which could reflect aspiration given the clinical
 setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is top
 normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Perihilar opacities could reflect pulmonary edema with more
 confluent retrocardiac opacity which is concerning for aspiration given the
 clinical setting.
