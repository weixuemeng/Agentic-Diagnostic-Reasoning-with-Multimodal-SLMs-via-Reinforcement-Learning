                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath, dialysis, interval change of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left moderate pleural effusion and right minimal pleural effusion has
 increased since previous exam.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Cardiac contour
 is mildly enlarged and left lower lobe increased density could be due to the
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis; however, superimposed
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Increase in moderate left pleural effusion and minimal right pleural
 effusion. There is no pulmonary edema.
 2.  New left lower lung opacities could be a mix of pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis.  A superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
