                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male with a history of CAD, sCHF (EF ___%), COPD, DM2,
 HTN, ESRD on HD (MWF), and recent UGIB p/w hypoxia, still hypoxic after volume
 removal at dialysis // level of pulm edema. r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pleural effusion is improved. Left basilar opacity likely reflects
 combination of moderate pleural effusion and possible atelectasis or
 consolidation. There is new fluid in the minor fissure. Moderate cardiomegaly
 is stable. There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion but pulmonary
 edema is significantly improved.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. There is calcification of the aortic knob. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Significant improvement of pulmonary edema.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 2. Worsening opacity at the left base may reflect atelectasis. Pneumonia is
 felt less likely but cannot be completely excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 3. Small right pleural effusion is smaller and moderate left pleural effusion
 is unchanged.
