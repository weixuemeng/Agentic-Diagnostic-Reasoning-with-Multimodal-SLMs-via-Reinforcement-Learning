                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again cardiomegaly is present but stable.  No pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  Perihilar right-sided opacities appear more prominent than on the
 prior study and may represent aspiration given the patients history. Low lung
 volumes and the patient's rotation could also account for this apparent
 increase.  No fractures. There is no pulmonary edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased right lower lung opacities raising the possibility of
 aspiration given the seizure history.  Low lung volumes and the patient's
 rotation could also account for this apparent increase.
