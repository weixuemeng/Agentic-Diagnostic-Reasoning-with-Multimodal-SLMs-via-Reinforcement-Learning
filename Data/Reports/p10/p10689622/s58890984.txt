                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of seizure.  Please evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly has been stable compared to the prior exam from
 ___.  The evaluation of the lung parenchyma is limited due to low
 lung volumes and patient rotation, particularly of the left lower lobe. There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited assessment of the left lower lobe due to patient rotation, however no
 definite abnormalities are identified. Recommend repeat true upright and
 lateral radiographs for further evaluation.
