                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 858 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with wedge resection, status post chest tube
 removal, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall, there continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving
 the right lateral chest wall soft tissues and extending into the soft tissues
 of the neck.  The left neck soft tissues are now involved, and there is
 additional dissection laterally towards the soft tissues overlying the distal
 right clavicle.  On the lateral projection, the amount of air does not appear
 to be significantly changed.  There is suggestion of a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  Post-operative changes in the right upper lung and paratracheal
 region are stable.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 No pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.
