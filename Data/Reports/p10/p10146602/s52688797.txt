                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Evidence of prior right upper
 lobe Weber ___ resection noted with clips in the right suprahilar region and
 suture along the right mid to upper lung as on prior.  Subtle increased
 opacity is seen projecting over the suture material in the right mid lung
 which may represent scarring though difficult to exclude an infectious or
 neoplastic process.  Elsewhere lungs are clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.  Postsurgical changes in the right lung.  Subtle increased opacity
 in the region of the right upper lobe suture material raises potential concern
 for underlying infection or malignancy.  Recommend clinical correlation and
 follow-up to resolution.
