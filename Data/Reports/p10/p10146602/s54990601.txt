                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 19:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema
 status post wedge resection.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest and ___ at 9:14 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the right
 chest wall soft tissues and extending up to both sides of the neck with some
 more air now seen tracking in the left neck soft tissues when compared to the
 prior studies.  This could just represent additional air tracking, although an
 ongoing air leak cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Multiple surgical clips in right
 paratracheal region as well as surgical chain sutures in the right upper and
 mid lung are again seen in this patient status post recent wedge resection. 
 No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No large
 effusions, although there is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 which may represent a tiny effusion and/or pleural thickening.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
