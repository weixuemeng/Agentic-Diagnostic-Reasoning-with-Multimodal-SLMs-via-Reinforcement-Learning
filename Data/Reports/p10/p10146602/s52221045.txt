 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new-onset subcutaneous emphysema,
 question leak from chest tube site.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increasing amount of subcutaneous emphysema which would be concerning for
 an air leak.  Surgical clips are again seen in the right paratracheal region. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No focal airspace
 consolidation seen to suggest pneumonia.  There are stable post-operative
 changes in the right upper lung.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated, although it is somewhat challenging due to the extensive
 overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
