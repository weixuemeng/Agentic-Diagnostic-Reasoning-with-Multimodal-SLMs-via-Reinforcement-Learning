                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diffuse leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The frontal
 view is suboptimal due to patient body habitus.  There are also relatively low
 lung volumes.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Relative opacity
 projecting over the medial right lung base is nonspecific, could be due to
 vascular crowding, however, underlying consolidation not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to underpenetration due to patient body
 habitus.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Relative opacity at the medial right lung base
 may be due to overlapping vascular structures, although consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
