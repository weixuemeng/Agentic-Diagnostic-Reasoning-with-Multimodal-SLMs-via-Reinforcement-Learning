                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  does this gentleman have airway space disease or pleural
 effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 1 portable view.  Lung volumes are low.  There is hazy increased density at
 the lung bases likely representing pleural fluid.  The retrocardiac area is
 not well penetrated and there is a suggestion of air bronchograms in the lower
 right lung.  The cardiac silhouette appears large although cardiac size may be
 exaggerated by technical factors.  Mediastinal structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.  An endotracheal tube is present and terminates approximately 3
 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is in place and terminates well below
 the diaphragm, off of the bottom of the image.  A no other radiopaque catheter
 is projected over the lower left chest, with its tip projected over the left
 hilus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evidence for bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation or atelectasis in
 the left lower lobe.  Prominent cardiac silhouette.
 
 Repeat examination with a better inspiratory effort and lateral view would be
 helpful.
