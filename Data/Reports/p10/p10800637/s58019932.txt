 Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of cardiac silhouette
 which is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no
 pulmonary edema is present.  Minimal atelectasis is seen at the lung bases. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bilateral fusion hardware spans
 the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
