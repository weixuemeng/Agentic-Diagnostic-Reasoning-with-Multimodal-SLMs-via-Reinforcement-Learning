                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ETT  // Eval ETT, OGT      Eval ETT, OGT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.
 Nasogastric tube extends at least to the mid body of the stomach where it
 passes the lower margin of the image.
 There has been the development of diffuse bilateral central opacifications,
 more prominent on the right, consistent with the bat-wing appearance of severe
 pulmonary edema.
 There is continued enlargement of cardiac silhouette in a patient with
 evidence of previous CABG procedure and intact midline sternal wires.
 Bibasilar opacification is consistent with atelectatic change and blunting of
 costophrenic angles suggests pleural effusions bilaterally.
