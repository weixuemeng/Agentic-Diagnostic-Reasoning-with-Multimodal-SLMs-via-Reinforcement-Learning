                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is accompanied by asymmetrical right perihilar airspace
 opacification, as well as peripheral interstitial opacities.  The persistent
 right perihilar opacity could be due to asymmetrical edema, but infectious
 pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
