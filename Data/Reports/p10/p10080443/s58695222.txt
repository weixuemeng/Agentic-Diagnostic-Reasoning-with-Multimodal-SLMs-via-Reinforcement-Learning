                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right percutaneous lithotripsy,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  This study is most likely not an upright
 film and therefore pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is present on the current exam; however a true upright chest
 radiograph or CT would be recommended if there is clinical concern to exclude
 a pneumothorax.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits in the setting of low lung volumes.
