 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia and prostate cancer, right-sided drains.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing
 degenerative change at the thoracolumbar junction, better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The patient shows unchanged
 atelectasis at the left lung base, but no evidence of acute lung changes such
 as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  In particular, the right lung base appears
 normal.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  The hilar contours are normal.
