                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest demonstrate clear lungs, without pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild apical pleural thickening seen
 bilaterally.  There is unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The mediastinal
 contours are otherwise unremarkable with note made of calcification at the
 aortic arch.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There is mild
 pulmonary interstitial abnormality.  There is mild loss of height of an upper
 thoracic vertebral body, likely chronic. Deformity likely reflecting a healed
 fracture is noted of the left posterior sixth rib .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Mild interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality may reflect chronic changes.  Recommend comparison with priors.
 2.  There is mild loss of height of an upper thoracic vertebral body, likely
 chronic.
