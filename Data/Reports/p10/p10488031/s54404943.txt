                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  EVALUATE STATUS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube
 is looped in the upper stomach.  ET tube is in standard placement. 
 Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are
 unchanged in standard placements.  Borderline cardiomegaly is stable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Lower lobe
 predominant pulmonary consolidation could be dependent pulmonary edema, but
 concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage are certainly possible.
