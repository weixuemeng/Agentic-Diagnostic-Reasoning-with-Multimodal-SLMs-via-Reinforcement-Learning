                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ? fall, SAH/SDH, hypoxia  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is noted.  Low lung volumes are seen
 with pulmonary vascular congestion.   No visualized parenchymal markings
 identified at the left lung apex.  Although no discrete pleural reflection is
 identified, this raises concern for underlying pneumothorax.  Alternatively,
 could represent an underlying bleb.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are noted.  Posterior left seventh, through tenth rib fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lack of parenchymal markings at the left lung apex raising the possibility of
 underlying pneumothorax.  Alternatively, bleb is possible.
 Posterior left rib fractures are noted, age indeterminate based on this image.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with the ___ resident physician.
