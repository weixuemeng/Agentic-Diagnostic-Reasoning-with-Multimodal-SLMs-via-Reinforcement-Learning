                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fall w/ etOH and SAH/SDH reintubated for
 somnolence  // ETT position, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina.  A nasoenteric tube
 terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the tip is not visualized.  A
 right-sided PICC coils of into the right internal jugular vein and the tip is
 positioned in the right brachiocephalic vein.  The cardiomediastinal contour
 is unchanged.  There is prominence of the bilateral hila and the pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  There is increased
 airspace opacity in the right lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. The right-sided PICC is coiled in the right internal jugular with the tip
 in the right brachiocephalic vein.
 2. Increasing airspace opacity of the right lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis as seen on the prior CT, infection cannot be excluded.
