                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:40 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after a fall.  Intracerebral hemorrhage and
 hypoxia.  Question aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Hyperinflated right lung is good evidence for COPD, either small airway
 obstruction or emphysema or both.  The relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is presumably eventration.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
