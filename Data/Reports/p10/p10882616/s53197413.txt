                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter remain in standard
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for this factor.  Slight
 improvement in atelectasis in both lower lungs with residual atelectasis, more
 prominent on the right than the left.  Moderate right and small left pleural
 effusions are present.  No visible pneumothorax.
