                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Respiratory failure and fever, question pulmonary
 process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 5:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in
 position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes
 remain slightly diminished with slightly smaller layering bilateral effusions.
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity is again seen, suggestive of compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Right posterior lateral fifth through seventh rib fractures are again
 identified.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax, although
 the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
