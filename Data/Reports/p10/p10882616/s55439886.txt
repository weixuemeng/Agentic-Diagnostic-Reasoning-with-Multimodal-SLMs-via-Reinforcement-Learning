 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:35.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube, NG tube and
 left subclavian central catheter in unchanged satisfactory position.  Compared
 to the prior study, lung volumes are lower with worsened moderate pulmonary
 edema and likely bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacification is
 unchanged. No large pneumothorax.
