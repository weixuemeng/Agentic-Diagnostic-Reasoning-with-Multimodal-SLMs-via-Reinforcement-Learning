 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 17:01
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new trach and bronchoscopy.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 5:35.
 
 A portable supine chest film, ___ at 17:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the endotracheal tube and placement of a tracheostomy
 tube, which has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  The left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid
 SVC.  There are layering bilateral effusions with stable patchy opacities,
 predominantly at both bases, suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.  No large
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given the supine technique.Unchanged right ___ posterolateral rib fractures.
