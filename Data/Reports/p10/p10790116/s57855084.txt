                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and rising PCO2.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient is after interval extubation.  There are bilateral pleural
 effusions that appear to be slightly increased.  There is also interval
 progression of pulmonary edema, currently a mixture of interstitial and
 alveolar components.  There is narrowing of the distal trachea, although that
 might reflect the presence of sabersheeth trachea, but should be correlated
 with subsequent evaluation to exclude the possibility of interval development
 of tracheal stenosis.
