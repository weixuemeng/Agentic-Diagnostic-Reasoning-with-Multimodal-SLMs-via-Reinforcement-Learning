                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with wheezing and respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  Left
 costophrenic angle and hemidiaphragm is obscured, suggestive of moderate
 pleural effusion and an adjacent area of consolidation.  Right cardiac border
 and right hemidiaphragm is preserved.  There is no large right pleural
 effusion.  Right lung base opacity is present.  Mediastinum appears widened. 
 Cardiac border is difficult to discern due to surrounding opacities. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, and moderate left
 pleural effusion, may represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Mild pulmonary edema.
