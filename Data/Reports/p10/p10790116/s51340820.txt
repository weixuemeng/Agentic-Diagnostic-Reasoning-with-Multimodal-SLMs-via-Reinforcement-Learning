                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, COPD and pneumonia, aggressively
 diuresed over last two days.  Please evaluate for interval changes.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 11:42.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 13:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.  Marked interval improvement in
 bibasilar airspace opacities and indistinct pulmonary vascularity consistent
 with resolving pulmonary edema.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity
 which likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasisand a small layering
 effusion, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  Less
 pronounced patchy opacity at the right medial lung base also likely reflects
 patchy atelectasis, possibly with an associated effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 No overt pulmonary edema on the current examination.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in technique and
 positioning between studies.
