                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute shortness of breath after blood transfusion.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the projection.  Bibasilar
 opacities, larger on the right side, are consistent with likely small pleural
 effusions and consolidations.  There is mild-to-moderate interstitial edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Followup is recommended
 to exclude the development of TRALI.
