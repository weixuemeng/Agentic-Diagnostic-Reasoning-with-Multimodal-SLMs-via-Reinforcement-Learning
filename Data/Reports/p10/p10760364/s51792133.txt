                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p craniotomy for ___ evacuation returning to the SICU with
 new onset seizure, possible aspiration pneumonia. New pressor requirement.  //
 interval change. ? ARDS     interval change. ? ARDS
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 cardiac silhouette with stable or possibly worsening pulmonary edema.  There
 is increased opacification more focally involving the right base which, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, could be consistent with the clinical diagnosis
 of aspiration pneumonia.  Silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms with haziness at
 both bases is consistent with layering pleural effusion, which makes a firm
 diagnosis of superimposed pneumonia is somewhat difficult, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
