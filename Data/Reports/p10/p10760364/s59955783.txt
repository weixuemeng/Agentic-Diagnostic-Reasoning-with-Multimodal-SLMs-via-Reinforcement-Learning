 new lung pathology
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is continued evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion not significantly
 changed.  There is asymmetric density at the left lung base consistent with
 atelectasis and/or consolidation and likely pleural fluid.  This finding is
 more pronounced than on the earlier study.  Mediastinal structures are stable.
 An endotracheal tube, feeding tube, left subclavian catheter and right
 internal jugular catheter remain in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening asymmetric density at the left lung base as described. Otherwise
 stable examination.
