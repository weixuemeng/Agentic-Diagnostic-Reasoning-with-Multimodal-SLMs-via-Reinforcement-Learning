 respiratory distress
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there again is some
 asymmetry in opacification at the bases, more prominent on the left.  In view
 of the clinical history, this could well represent aspiration or infectious
 pneumonia.
 There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4
 cm above the carina.
