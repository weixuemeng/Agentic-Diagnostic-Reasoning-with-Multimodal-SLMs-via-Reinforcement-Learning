 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Compared to the prior chest radiograph
 performed a few hours prior, there has been interval development of bilateral
 perihilar opacities and small bilateral pleural effusions. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis. The aortic knob is calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.
 The colon is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  Chain sutures project over

 opacities with perihilar distribution and small bilateral pleural effusions
 consistent with worsening pulmonary edema, now moderate in severity.
