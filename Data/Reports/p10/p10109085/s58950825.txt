 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with radiofrequency ablation of right

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in

 obtained two hours earlier.  The patient remains in supine position.  The ETT
 terminates in the trachea 6 cm above the level of the carina as before.

 Comparison with the next previous study suggests mild improvement of the
 pulmonary edema.  No new localized infiltrates are seen.  A pneumothorax,
 although unlikely, cannot be ruled out with the patient in supine position.
