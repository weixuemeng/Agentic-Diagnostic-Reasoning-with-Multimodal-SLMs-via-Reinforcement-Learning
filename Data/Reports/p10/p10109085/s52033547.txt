                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, hypoxia, history of lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated
 with interposition of the colon between the diaphragm and liver.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes.  Right infrahilar mass corresponding
 to known malignancy is re- demonstrated with adjacent opacities in the right
 lung base which may reflect areas of atelectasis or infection but are similar
 compared to the prior radiograph.  Scarring in the left lung base is re-
 demonstrated.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Clip
 is demonstrated within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Chain sutures
 are noted within the right lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Re- demonstration of right infrahilar opacity compatible with known malignancy
 with adjacent patchy opacity in the right lung base which may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Emphysema.
