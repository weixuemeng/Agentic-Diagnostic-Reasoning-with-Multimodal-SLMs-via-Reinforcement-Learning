 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, caused by slightly distended
 right bowel loops.  Atelectasis at the right lung bases and mild parenchymal
 opacities in the lateral parts of the right upper lobe base.  These have not
 substantially changed as compared to the prior image.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 with moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.
