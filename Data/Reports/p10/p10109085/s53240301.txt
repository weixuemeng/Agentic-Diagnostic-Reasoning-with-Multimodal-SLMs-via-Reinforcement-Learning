                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with interposition of the hepatic flexure.  The
 underlying malignancy and lymphatic enlargement seen on CT is not definitely
 appreciated on plain radiographs.  The retrocardiac region is somewhat clear
 and the left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen.
