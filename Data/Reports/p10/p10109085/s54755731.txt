                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with two small nodules in
 the lung base after biopsy with some hemorrhage, exclude pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 No definitive pneumothorax is seen on the current examination.  Right basal
 opacity appears to be slightly improved since the prior study.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.
