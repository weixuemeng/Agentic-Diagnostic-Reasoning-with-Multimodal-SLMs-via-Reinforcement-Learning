                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  When compared to prior, there is new mild indistinctness
 of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization.  There is no confluent
 consolidation.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles raises
 possibility of small effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. 
 Multiple lead pacing device again seen with tips about right ventricular apex,
 right atrium, and two within the coronary sinus.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild fluid overload and probable trace pleural effusions, new
 since prior exam.
