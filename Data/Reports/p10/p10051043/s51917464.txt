                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This study is presented on ___ for dictation.  
 
 A right internal central jugular venous catheter again terminates in the
 superior vena cava.  There is overall slightly better aeration of the chest
 but similar heterogeneous multifocal opacities with suspected pleural
 effusions.  Some improvement may be due to decrease in edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild improvement in aeration, possibly due to decreased edema superimposed on
 severe bilateral heterogeneous opacification which is otherwise unchanged.
