 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 13:14 p.m., the overall appearance is similar.  There
 may have been slight improvement in the CHF findings. as the degree of upper
 zone redistribution  and vascular plethora appears less pronounced.  The
 bilateral effusions also appear slightly smaller.  However, there remain
 bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly unchanged.  Sternotomy
 wires again noted.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Rounded densities
 superimposed over the cardiac silhouette may reflect the patient's AVR.

 effusions.  Otherwise, similar to ___. Small bilateral effusions remain
