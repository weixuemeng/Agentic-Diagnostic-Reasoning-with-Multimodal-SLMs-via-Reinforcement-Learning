                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Concern for pneumoperitoneum on previous chest x-ray
 performed three hours earlier.
 
 Air collection projecting at the level of the left hemidiaphragm is likely in
 the stomach.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased.  Pulmonary edema has
 improved.  Right lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent effusion are unchanged. 
 Widened mediastinum has improved.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung
 volumes.
