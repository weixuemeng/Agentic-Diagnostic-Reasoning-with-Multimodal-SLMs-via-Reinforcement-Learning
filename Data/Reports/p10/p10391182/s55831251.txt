                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Six foot fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There is minimal anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Minimal anterior wedging of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age.  Correlate clinically for
 acuity and need for additional imaging.
