                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day #3 from kidney transplant, increased cough, assess for
 evidence of effusion, exudate, atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 A right IJ terminates in the right atrium.  Lung volumes are still low, but
 improved from prior study.  The diffuse interstitial edema is also improved. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged, but hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  A tiny left pleural effusion is present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in interstitial edema.  To reposition the IJ
 line in the low SVC, it would need to be withdrawn 2cm.
