 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, likely aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal and unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are relatively
 stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and the hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are present.  Minimal streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect mild atelectasis.  Prominent left epicardial
 fat pad is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation noted.
