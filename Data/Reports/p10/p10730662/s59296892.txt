 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 01:01 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours appear somewhat widened but
 are unchanged since ___ and therefore likely reflect a combination of
 prominent vascular structures and patient rotation. There is subtle streaky
 opacity in the retrocardiac region which may represent focal atelectasis,
 although early pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Followup
 imaging may be helpful. No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
