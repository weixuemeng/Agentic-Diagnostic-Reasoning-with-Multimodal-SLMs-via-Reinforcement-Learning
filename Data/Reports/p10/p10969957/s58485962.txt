                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall.  Please evaluate for evidence
 of acute trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms
 suggesting emphysematous lung disease.  A linear radiopacity across the lower
 right lung represents discoid atelectasis.  An ill-defined opacity in the
 periphery of the lower right lung is in the same location as in prior exam and
 is likely a summation of structures including the nipple.  There are no other
 focal opacities bilaterally.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Bilateral apical calcified pleural plaques are noted, but there
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Fractured sternotomy wires are again
 seen and the patient is status post CABG surgery.  There is a prior resection
 of the posterior left sixth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  If there are
 concerns for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series is recommended for further
 assessment.
