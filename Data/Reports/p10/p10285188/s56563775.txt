                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Acute increased tachypnea and
 hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection.  The patient is
 rotated.  There are low lung volumes.  Left lung consolidation is unchanged
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Increasing opacities
 in the right lower lobe are a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  There
 is mild pulmonary edema that is new.
