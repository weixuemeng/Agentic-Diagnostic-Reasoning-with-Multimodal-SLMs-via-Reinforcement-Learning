 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, on chronic steroids, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes remain low, moderate cardiomegaly and relatively
 large left atrium.  No pleural effusions, no evidence of pneumonia on the
 frontal and lateral radiograph.  This is consistent with CT examination
 performed on ___.
 
 In the same manner than on ___, the retrosternal lung areas remain
 relatively dense, likely caused by patient constitution.  No evidence of
 pleural effusions.  The cardiac contours are unremarkable.
