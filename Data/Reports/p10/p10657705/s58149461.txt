                                 FINAL REPORT

 fevers and dry cough.  Concern for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 The heart size is top normal.  There is a 10 mm nodular density seen in the
 region between the anterior fourth and fifth ribs.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Nodular density could represent
 aspergillus infection in an immunocompromised patient.  CT-Chest is
 recommended to further evaluate this finding.
