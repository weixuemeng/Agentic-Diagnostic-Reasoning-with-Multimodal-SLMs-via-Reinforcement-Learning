                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness and reported fever at home  // Eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  The lungs appear grossly
 clear bilaterally.  The area of concern on prior radiograph is less
 conspicuous with a subtle peripheral opacity in the right mid to upper lung
 again noted.  As stated previously, a CT could be performed to further assess
 though decrease conspicuity suggests a resolving process.  Also noted, is a
 presumed spur arising from the right first anterior rib accounting for
 increased density abutting the right mediastinum.  No convincing evidence for
 pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour stable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
