                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS fever  // eval for pna cxrnchct eval iCH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   CT abdomen and pelvis on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal in size.  Lung volumes are low which accentuates
 bronchovascular markings.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Subtly
 increased density within the left lower lobe could represent infection or
 atelectasis.  In addition, there is subtle increased opacity at the right mid
 lung laterally overlying the anterior right third rib.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Subtly increased opacity within the left lower lobe likely
 atelectasis.
 More focal opacity in the right mid lung laterally, nonspecific.  Consider
 repeat with improved inspiration to further characterize this findings exclude
 underlying parenchymal opacity or possible nodule.  If it persists, CT scan
 should be considered.
