 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left empyema sp decort  // ptx, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following insertion of left apical and basal pleural drains, there has been a
 substantial decrease in the volume of left pleural effusion, small to
 moderate, and largely basal.  Left lower lobe is poorly aerated, so I cannot
 exclude pneumonia there. The upper lung is clear. There is mild re-expansion
 edema in the left midlung.  Right lung is clear.  CT scanning would be helpful
 in assessing both the left pleural space an the lower lung, depending course
 upon the profile of the thoracentesis aspirate.  No pneumothorax.
