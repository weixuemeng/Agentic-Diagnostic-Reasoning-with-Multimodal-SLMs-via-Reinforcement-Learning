                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p empyema  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:   PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ at 12:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tiny volume of residual air in the left pleural space laterally and
 anteriorly, in the small, stable volume of loculated left pleural fluid or
 pleural thickening, reflects recent removal of the left thoracostomy tube. 
 The left hemidiaphragm is more elevated now than it was several days ago, an
 indication of greater volume loss in the left lower lobe.  The right lung and
 pleural space and visible mediastinal contours and structures are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small amount of thoracostomy related air and residual pleural fluid
 loculation, unchanged.
 2. Mild volume loss at the left lower lobe.
