                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dementia and hx of stroke presenting after a fall of
 unknown etiology.  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lateral view is limited secondary to patient's arms being down by her side. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged on this AP view.  The aorta shows calcified
 atherosclerosis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.   A linear
 opacity in the mid left lung may represent atelectasis or scarring.  More
 subtle opacities at the base of the left lung could represent atelectasis or
 infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the base of the left lung may reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting.  A more linear opacity in
 the left mid lung likely reflects atelectasis.
