                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left upper
 lobe parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved.  However, the cardiac
 silhouette remains markedly enlarged and signs of vascular distention are
 seen.  In addition, a left retrocardiac parenchymal opacity persists. 
 Overall, the findings suggest persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with
 a decreasing right upper lobe pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.
