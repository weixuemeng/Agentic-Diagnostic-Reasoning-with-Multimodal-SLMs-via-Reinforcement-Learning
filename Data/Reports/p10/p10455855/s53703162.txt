                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  For cough
 and right greater than left basilar opacities may be due to combination of
 pleural effusion, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema, however underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.    The cardiac silhouette severely enlarged. 
 The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to severe pulmonary edema, and
 marked cardiomegaly suggest CHF.  More confluent opacities at the right
 greater than left lung bases may be due to combination of the above, however,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.
