                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Bibasilar opacities are again seen, likely
 a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  Perihilar opacities/prominence of the hila
 likely relate to underlying pulmonary edema, which appears mildly improved as
 compared to the prior study.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bibasilar opacities may represent combination of
 pleural effusions and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not entirely
 excluded.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Pulmonary edema, somewhat
 improved from the prior study.
