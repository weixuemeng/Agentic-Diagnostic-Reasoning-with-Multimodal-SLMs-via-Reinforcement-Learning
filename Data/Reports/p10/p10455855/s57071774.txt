                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with congestive heart failure with shortness of
 breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Again seen is a left chest wall dual-lead pacing device. 
 There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.  The degree of
 pulmonary edema appears less conspicuous on the current which may be due to
 improved aeration.  There is more conspicuous right basilar opacity which
 could represent a superimposed infection.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch.  No
 acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings again compatible with congestive failure, not definitely
 changed from prior.  As previously mentioned, component of infection,
 particularly at the right lung base, cannot be excluded.
