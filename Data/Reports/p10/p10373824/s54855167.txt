                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To evaluate for stability of right apical density.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to be little
 change in the biapical opacifications, more prominent on the right, most
 likely consistent with old scarring.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs persists,
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, though there is no evidence of
 acute pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Old
 healed rib fractures are again seen at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
