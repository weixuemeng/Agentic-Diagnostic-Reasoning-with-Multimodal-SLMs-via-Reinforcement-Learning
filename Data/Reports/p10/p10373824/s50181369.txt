                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with   Asymmetric opacity in the right apex,
 has possibly increased since ___, although this may be related to
 patient rotation.  This increase may reflect superimposed acute pneumonia or
 increasing apical thickening.  If there is a strong clinical concern for
 malignancy, a CT thorax should be considered.  // f/u cxr  COUGH;F/U CHEST
 XRAY
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with studies dating back to ___, the area of increased
 opacification in the right apical region has not substantially change.  The
 less prominent opacification in the left apex also appears stable.  The
 findings most likely reflect pleural thickening consistent with old
 tuberculous disease.
 Remainder the examination is unchanged.
