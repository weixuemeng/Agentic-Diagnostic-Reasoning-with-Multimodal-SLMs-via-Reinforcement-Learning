                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate overlying
 soft tissue densities obscuring the lateral aspects of the lung fields.  The
 cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is within normal limits. 
 Bilateral hilar fullness likely indicates pulmonary vascular congestion, with
 upper zone redistribution, indicative of mild congestive heart failure.
 Additionally, opacity in the right infrahilar region may represent infectious
 process. If no infection is suspected clinically, CT of the chest is
 recommended to further evaluate this abnormality.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild CHF with right infrahilar opacity which may represent
 infectious process, but if not clinically consistent, recommend CT for
 evaluation of this area.
 
 These findings were entered into the Radiology Reporting Dashboard.
