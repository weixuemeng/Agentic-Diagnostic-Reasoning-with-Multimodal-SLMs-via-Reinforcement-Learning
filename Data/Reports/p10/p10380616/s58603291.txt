 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p tracheobronchoplasty  // interval change,

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal, if any improvement compared to the prior exam.  Persistent small
 right pleural effusion that is perhaps minimally decreased and persistent
 stable right lower lung atelectasis.  Stable right pleural thickening.  The
 previously noted right lower lobe opacity slightly obscuring the right
 hemidiaphragm, best seen on the lateral view, is slightly improved and less
 conspicuous today.  Right lung pulmonary vascular congestion is better today. 
 Trace left pleural effusion is best seen on the lateral view.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinum and hila are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema.  Calcification of the aortic knob is
 again noted.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant are
 unchanged.  Degenerative changes in diffuse bony mineralization in the
 thoracic spine are also unchanged with some vertebrae demonstrating chronic
 appearing anterior wedge compression deformities.
