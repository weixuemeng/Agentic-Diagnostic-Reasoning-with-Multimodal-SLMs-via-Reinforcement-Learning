                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old status post unwitnessed fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Correlation made to a CT cervical spine from the same day.
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Exam is limited secondary to portable
 technique and patient's body positioning.  The increased retrocardiac opacity
 suggestive of hiatal hernia.  Left base opacity is also seen with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within
 normal limits given severely limited exam.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic. 
 There is coarsened trabecular pattern of the proximal left humerus suggestive
 of pagetoid changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacity potentially due to atelectasis infection or aspiration,
 not well visualized.  PA and lateral may offer additional detail if patient is
 amenable
