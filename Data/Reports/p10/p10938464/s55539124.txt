                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to pleural
 thickening or very trace pleural effusion.  Subtle right base opacity is felt
 to be due to overlap of vascular structures rather than true focal
 consolidation.  This could be further assessed on PA and lateral views of the
 chest.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable with slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery which can be seen
 with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Prominent
 right hilum is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD.
