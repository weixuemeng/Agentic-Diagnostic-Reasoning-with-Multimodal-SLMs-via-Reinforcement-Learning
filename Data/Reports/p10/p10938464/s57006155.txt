                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R pleural effusion s/p chest tube.  Assess
 for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, there has been interval placement of a
 right-sided pigtail catheter, projecting in the region of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is a small adjacent right basilar pneumothorax, which
 may be loculated, given that this is an upright view.  The previous right
 effusion has significantly decreased in size, with residual atelectasis in the
 right lung base.  The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  No new
 focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small, possibly loculated, right basilar pneumothorax after right chest tube
 insertion.  Significant interval decrease in the size of the right pleural
 effusion.
