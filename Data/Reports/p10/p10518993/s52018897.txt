                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and likely opiate overdose.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size appears top normal, and likely
 accentuated by the low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged with apparent widening of the superior mediastinum likely
 attributable to mediastinal fat as seen on the prior CT.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy airspace opacities in the lung bases
 may reflect atelectasis.  Ill-defined 1 cm nodular opacity projecting over the
 right upper lung field appears new compared to the prior study, an and area of
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Loss of the right acromial humeral interval is compatible
 with underlying rotator cuff disease.  Moderate to severe degenerative changes
 of both glenohumeral acromioclavicular joints are re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  Ill-defined nodular opacity in the
 right upper lung field may also represent a site of infection but is
 nonspecific.
