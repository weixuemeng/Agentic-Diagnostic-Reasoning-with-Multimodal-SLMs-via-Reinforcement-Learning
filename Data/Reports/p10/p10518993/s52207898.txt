                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___, AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar to multiple prior exams, lung volumes are profoundly
 diminished.  Hazy opacity at both lung bases is likely atelectasis.  A large
 bore dual-lumen dialysis catheter is again noted in a stable course and
 position from a right subclavian approach.  Mild aortic tortuosity is again
 noted.  The cardiac silhouette size is stable.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax is noted.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic
 spine.  Degenerative changes are again present in bilateral shoulder joints as
 well.  Right humeral head is suggestive of chronic rotator cuff injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.
