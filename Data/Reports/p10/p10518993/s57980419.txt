                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight left
 base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis, less likely
 early infectious process.  Right lung is clear.  There are low lung volumes. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine, although not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis,
 although an early consolidation is not entirely excluded, but felt less
 likely.
