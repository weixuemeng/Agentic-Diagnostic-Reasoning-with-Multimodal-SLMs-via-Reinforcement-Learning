                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pancreatic mass with atypical cells x___ years,
 with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Ill-defined focal
 opacities are seen within the right upper lobe, right lung base, and periphery
 of the left mid lung field.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 posteriorly suggests a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present.  There are degenerative changes within the
 imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral multifocal airspace opacities, potentially multifocal pneumonia,
 however given the patient's history of pancreatic mass, metastases are also
 within the differential diagnosis.  Comparison with prior radiographs or
 further assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Bilateral multifocal airspace opacities, potentially
 multifocal pneumonia, however given the patient's history of pancreatic mass,
 metastases are also within the differential diagnosis. Comparison with prior
 radiographs or further assessment with contrast-enhanced chest CT is
 recommended.
