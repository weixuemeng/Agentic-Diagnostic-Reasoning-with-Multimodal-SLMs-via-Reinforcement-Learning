                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated from outside hospital // evaluate for tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.4 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses into the stomach with tip off the inferior borders of the
 film.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Mild
 prominence of the left hila could suggest enlargement of the pulmonary artery
 or underlying lymphadenopathy.  Peribronchial cuffing with patchy opacities
 are noted in both lung bases which may reflect infection and bronchitis.  More
 focal opacity within the retrocardiac region is also concerning for an area of
 infection.  There is no pneumothorax.  Clips are seen within the right chest
 wall and axillary region.  Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral
 joints are noted.  Fusion hardware is noted within the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities with peribronchial cuffing, findings
 concerning for infection, particularly in the retrocardiac region, as well as
 bronchitis.
 3. Prominence of the left hilum could reflect enlargement of the left main
 pulmonary artery or underlying lymphadenopathy.
