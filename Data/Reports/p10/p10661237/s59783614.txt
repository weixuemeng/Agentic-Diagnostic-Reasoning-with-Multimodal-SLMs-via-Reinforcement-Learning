                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and poor air movement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout from CT torso performed on ___ and recent
 radiographs performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, although it is difficult to resolve the cardiac contour. 
 There is a new perihilar fullness, upper zone re-distribution, and hazy
 opacity suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  In addition, the left
 hemidiaphragm is more obscured suggesting that possibly there is a developing
 left lower lobe or lingular process.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion as well as a
 potential focal process developing in the left lower lobe.  Standard PA and
 lateral radiographs could be helpful to evaluate further if clinically
 indicated versus a short-term followup radiograph and clinical correlation.
