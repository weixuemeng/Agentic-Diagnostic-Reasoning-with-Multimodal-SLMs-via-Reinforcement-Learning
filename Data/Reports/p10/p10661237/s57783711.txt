                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Marked cardiomegaly is stable in appearance.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion has improved, and pulmonary edema has nearly resolved with minimal
 residual interstitial edema remaining.  Interval improved aeration in left
 lower lobe with residual patchy and linear atelectasis remaining.  Right
 retrocardiac opacity appears similar and also likely represents atelectasis. 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema with minimal residual interstitial edema
 remaining.  Small pleural effusions.
