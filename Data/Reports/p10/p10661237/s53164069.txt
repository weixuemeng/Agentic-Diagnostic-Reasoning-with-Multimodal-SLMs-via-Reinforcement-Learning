                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, hypoxia, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  Aneurysmal dilatation of the
 ascending thoracic aorta is again noted.  Widening of the superior mediastinal
 contour is due to known thyroid goiter and appears unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis.  Similar appearance of widened superior mediastinal contour due
 to known thoracic aortic aneurysm and thyroid goiter.
