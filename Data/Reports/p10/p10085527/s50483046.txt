                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of recent pneumonia with
 severe pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a focal opacity overlying the right lower lobe with
 silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm.  Otherwise, the left lung is clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity, with silhouetting of the right
 hemidiaphragm is most consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. However, a
 peripheral infarction due to pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded. A followup
 radiograph in 6 weeks after resolution of symptoms is recommended.
