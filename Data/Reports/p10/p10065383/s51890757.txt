                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:27 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress, status post
 intubation, evaluate pneumonia, ARDS.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 22:15.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 4:27 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube and an endotracheal
 tube are likely unchanged in position.  There is persistent consolidation in
 the right upper lobe, left upper lobe and left lower lobe.  There is slight
 improved aeration in the right middle and lower lobes, although there is still
 substantial airspace disease in these regions.  These findings more likely
 favor an acute infectious process given the change chronologically since
 ___.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the
 presence of the bilateral airspace disease.  No pneumothorax.
