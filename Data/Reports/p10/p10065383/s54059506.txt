                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM FROM ___ AT 17:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure due to pneumonia
 status post intubation, assess endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 2:59.
 
 Portable AP chest film, ___ at 17:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube with the tip at the
 thoracic inlet.  There is worsening airspace consolidation in the right upper,
 right middle and lower lobes as well as within the left upper and lower lobes
 consistent with worsening pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema.  The
 airspace consolidation obscures the cardiac and mediastinal contours limiting
 evaluation.  The stomach is incompletely visualized but appears to be
 distended with gas.  There is likely a layering left effusion.
