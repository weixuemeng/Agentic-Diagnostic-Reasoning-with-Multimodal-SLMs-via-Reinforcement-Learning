                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following placement of a left pigtail pleural catheter, a left
 pneumothorax has substantially decreased in size, with residual small
 pneumothorax remaining, and associated reexpansion of the left lung. 
 Widespread bilateral lung opacities are in keeping with history of ARDS, and
 may be accompanied by pulmonary interstitial emphysema.  Various support and
 monitoring devices including ECOM canula remain in place.  Within the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, moderate to marked gastric distention is
 present.  This is more fully evaluated on separately dictated abdominal
 radiograph on the same date under clip ___.
