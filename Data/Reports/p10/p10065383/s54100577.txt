                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Reported pneumonia sent in from PCP.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 large areas of consolidation involving the right upper lobe, left lower lobe
 and lingula as well as possibly the left upper lobe.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged, although not well assessed due to the adjacent
 left basilar and lingular opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive multifocal consolidations highly worrisome for
 multifocal pneumonia.  Differential diagnosis would also include pulmonary
 hemorrhage depending on the clinical scenario.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
