                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a persistent
 moderate-sized left apicolateral pneumothorax.  Support and monitoring devices
 are unchanged in position.  Widespread bilateral parenchymal opacification is
 consistent with history of ARDS, and may be complicated by pulmonary
 interstitial emphysema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
