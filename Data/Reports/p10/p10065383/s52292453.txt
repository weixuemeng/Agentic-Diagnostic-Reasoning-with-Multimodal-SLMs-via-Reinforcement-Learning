                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS due to pulmonary blastomycosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior exams including most recent
 from ___ at 8:00 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 development of large left pneumothorax with no significant mediastinal shift
 or signs of tension.  An endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the level
 of the carina.  An esophageal tube courses below the diaphragm and out of
 view.  Widespread right lung parenchymal opacities persist, consistent with
 ARDS.  Cystic and linear lucencies in the right lung are likely due to
 pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE).  There is gaseous distension of the
 stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New large left pneumothorax with no evidence of tension.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 8:51 a.m., at the time of review.
