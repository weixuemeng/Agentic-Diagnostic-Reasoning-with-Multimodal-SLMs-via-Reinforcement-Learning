                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Blastomycosis and ARDS, on ECMO.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:38 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows stable bilateral alveolar
 opacities with unchanged ECMO catheter, endotracheal tube, and enteric tube. 
 The endotracheal tube tip projects roughly 8 cm from the carina, and appears
 different from the previous x-ray likely due to the patient's chin now being
 up.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of lung parenchyma with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
