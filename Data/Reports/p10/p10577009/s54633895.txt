                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post Zenker's diverticulum pexy and myotomy.  Evaluate for
 atelectasis and soft tissue swelling in the neck.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and esophagram ___.
 
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are normal.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis without focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no
 pleural effusion, although, the left costophrenic angle was not fully imaged. 
 No pneumothorax.  Heart is normal size.
 
 A tubular radiopaque structure projects over the left neck and is presumably
 external.
