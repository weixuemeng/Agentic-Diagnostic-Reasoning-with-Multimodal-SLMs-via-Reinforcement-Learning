                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right subclavian PICC line is very difficult to see, though the
 tip appears to extend to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.  There
 are low lung volumes which may account for some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  No definite vascular congestion or acute
 focal pneumonia.
