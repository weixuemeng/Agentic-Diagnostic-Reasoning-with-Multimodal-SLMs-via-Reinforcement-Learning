                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain, question widened mediastinum.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The lungs may be slightly hyperinflated.  The heart is not enlarged.  Within
 the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy
 is detected.  Aortic knob is within normal limits radiographically.  There is
 biapical pleural thickening.  Given the symmetry, this is unlikely to
 represent post-traumatic apical capping.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated
 and ?slightly eventrated.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process identified.  No widening of the
 mediastinum identified.  If there is high concern for aortic dissection, then
 cross-sectional imaging could help for further assessment.
