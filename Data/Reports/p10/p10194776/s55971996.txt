                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new Dobbhoff tube placement, verify
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 802.
 
 Two views of the chest obtained in the semi-erect position are submitted for
 interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  On the initial view, the Dobbhoff feeding tube appears to be coiled just
 above the gastroesophageal junction.  On the second projection, the tube now
 traverses below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within the stomach. 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart remains stably
 enlarged.  There continues to be a bilateral interstitial and parenchymal
 process which is not significantly changed and may reflect pulmonary edema,
 although underlying interstitial lung disease should also be considered. 
 There are likely small layering effusions.  No pneumothorax.
