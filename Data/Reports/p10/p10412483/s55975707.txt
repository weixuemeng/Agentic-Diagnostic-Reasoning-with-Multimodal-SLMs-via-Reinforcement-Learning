                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall with point ttp over thoracic spine, as well as
 bilaterally along the ribs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study limited due to patient rotation.  In addition, the arm overlies the
 chest on the lateral view.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The hila are grossly
 unremarkable.  There are patchy left lower lung opacities which are similar in
 appearance to prior exam from ___, likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, there is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  There are small effusion seen posteriorly,
 likely bilateral.  There is no sizable pleural effusion.  There is no evidence
 of a displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No displaced rib fracture identified.  Please note that radiography is not
 sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib fractures.
 2. Patchy left lung opacities likely reflect atelectasis, unchanged from
 prior.
 3. Small posterior pleural effusions, likely bilateral.
