                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall out of bed, on blood thinners, with head
 strike, left shoulder pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal
 contour is similar.  Calcified left hilar nodes suggest prior granulomatous
 disease.  Prominence of the left hilum is similar compared to the previous
 study there is adjacent left perihilar linear atelectasis.  Ill-defined
 streaky opacities in the left perihilar region and right lung base may reflect
 areas of infection or atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky and patchy opacities in the left perihilar region and right lung base
 may reflect an infectious process in the correct clinical setting versus
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion.
