 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of gastric cancer, recent gastrointestinal bleeding,
 questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been removed.  Also removed is a previously placed left Port-A-Cath.  The
 patient now has a right-sided PICC line, the line has a normal course, the tip
 projects over the mid SVC.
 
 On the lateral radiograph only, bilateral small pleural effusions are seen. 
 The effusions cause minimal atelectasis at both the right and the left lung
 bases.  No evidence of parenchymal pathologies.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
