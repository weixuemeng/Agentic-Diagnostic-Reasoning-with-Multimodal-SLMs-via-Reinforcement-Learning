                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at ___;___ p.m. and allowing for technical differences, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Again seen is diffuse dense alveolar opacity in both lungs, consistent with
 ARDS.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.  
 
 The tip of the ET tube is difficult to visualize due to overlying structures
 and its level is therefore difficult to determine. Based on the prior film,
 the ET tube tip lie above the EKG clip approximately 5.1 cm above the carina
 -- clinical correlation is requested. The NG tube extends beneath the
 diaphragm off the film.  A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying the
 SVC/RA junction.
