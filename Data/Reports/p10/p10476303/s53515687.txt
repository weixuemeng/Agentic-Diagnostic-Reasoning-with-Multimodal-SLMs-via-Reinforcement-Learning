                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS, question infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 14:51 p.m.
 
 Compared with ___ CHF findings, there is more extensive alveolar opacity in
 both lungs.  Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar.  The differential
 diagnosis includes worsening CHF, diffuse bilateral alveolar pneumonic
 infiltrate, and changes of ARDS.  Clinical correlation is required for full
 assessment.  
 
 There is slightly increased opacity at the left base, which could represent
 either some more pleural fluid or progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  
 
 Again seen is a tracheostomy tube, a dual-lumen right IJ central line with
 tips over the distal SVC and upper RA, and prominent cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, all without significant change.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.  No gross right effusion is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening bilateral alveolar opacities. ?  worsening CHF, diffuse
 bilateral pneumonia, or ARDS.
 
 2.  Slightly increased opacity at left base could represent a combination of
 pleural fluid and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly
 worse than on the prior film.
