                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ years old man with ARDS/pulmonary edema.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of any improvement in pulmonary edema/ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in standard position,
 hemodialysis right jugular catheter is unchanged, with tip ending in right
 atrium.  The diffuse non-volume-dependent pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Also,
 minimal improvement of the right base is visible, likely for reduced pleural
 effusion.  Heart size and mediastinal silhouettes are enlarged since
 yesterday. This finding should be interpreted in light of central venous
 pressure measurement and ventilation setting, because it might reflecting a
 worsening of the heart/cardiac function or an increased central venous return.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate-to-severe non-dependent pulmonary edema, with
 minimal improvement of the right base ventilation for reduced pleural
 effusion.  Increased heart size and central vein distention should be
 clinically correlated.
