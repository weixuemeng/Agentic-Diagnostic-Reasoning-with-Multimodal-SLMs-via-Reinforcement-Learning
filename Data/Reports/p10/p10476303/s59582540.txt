                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS.  
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, ET
 tube and right IJ line appear unchanged in position.  NG tube also noted.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Dense bilateral alveolar
 infiltrates are again seen, slightly less pronounced at the bases.  While
 there is suggestion of more intense opacity on the current exam, this is
 likely accentuated by differences in techniques between the current film and
 the CXR from ___ at 3:16 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense bilateral alveolar infiltrates.  Doubt significant interval
 change compared with prior film.
