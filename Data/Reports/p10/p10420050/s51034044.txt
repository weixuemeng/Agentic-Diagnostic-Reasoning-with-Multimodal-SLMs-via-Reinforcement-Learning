 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST

 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. 
 Moderate bilateral effusions are larger on the right side, bibasilar
 consolidations are unchanged, this could be atelectasis but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is moderate vascular congestion.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
