 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right-sided VATS decortication.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, two right-sided chest tubes
 are in unchanged position.  Millimetric right apical pneumothorax.  Relatively
 extensive, overall unchanged right pleural effusion with a large intrafissural
 component.  No new parenchymal opacities but areas of atelectasis at the right
 lung base persist.  Unremarkable left lung, unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
