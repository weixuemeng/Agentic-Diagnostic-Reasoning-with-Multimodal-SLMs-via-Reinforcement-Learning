                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion status post VATS, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Two right-sided chest tubes are present.  Possible tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity at the right base.  Right hemidiaphragm
 elevated. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged, though there is a left ventricular configuration
 and slight unfolding of the aorta.  There is atelectasis in the left lower
 lobe.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly improved compared with ___.
 No CHF or left effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No obvious pneumothorax, but a tiny right apical pneumothorax would be
 difficult to exclude.  Patchy opacity at right base.
 2.  Improving left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
