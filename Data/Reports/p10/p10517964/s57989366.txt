                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Limited CT evaluation of the chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate areas of increased
 opacification of the right mid and lower lung, with effacement of the right
 heart border, concerning for right middle lobe and lower lobe pneumonia.
 However, underlying mass cannot be excluded. There is a probable right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Increased opacification of the left lung base probably
 represents atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Findigns as above raise concern for RML and RLL pneumonia with
 associated pleural effusion. However, underlying mass cannot be excluded.
 Recommend follow-up imaging to assess for underlying mass once pneumonia has
 resolved. 
 
 NOTIFICATION: These findings and follow-up recommendations were discussed with
 Dr. ___ ___ resident) by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 3:54pm on ___,
 10 minutes after discovery.
