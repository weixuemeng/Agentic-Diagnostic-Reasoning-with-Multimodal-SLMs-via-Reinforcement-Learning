 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of loculated pleural effusions and pneumonia.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA from ___ and chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided pigtail terminates at the medial right lung base. 
 There has been no significant interval change in the opacification of the mid
 and lower right lung secondary to large loculated pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis as described on the recent chest CT.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  Mild left basilar atelectasis is persistent. 
 There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable opacification of the mid and lower right lung consistent
 with large loculated pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 23:41
 on ___.
