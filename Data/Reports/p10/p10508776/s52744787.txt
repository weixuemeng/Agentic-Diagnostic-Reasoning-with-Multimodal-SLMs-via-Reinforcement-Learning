                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with aphasia and agitation.  Possible infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Left heart border is consistently obscured on prior chest radiographs,
 probably by atelectasis in the lingula which persists.  Lateral view shows a
 region of increased radiopacity projecting over the mid thoracic spine, and I
 cannot be sure whether that is sclerosis in the vertebral body or a region of
 lung abnormality.  There is only mild asymmetry in the lungs at that level on
 the frontal view, I would continue followup to exclude developing pneumonia in
 the superior segment of the right lower lobe, but I doubt that it is present. 
 Heart is normal size and there is no pleural effusion.  The patient has had
 median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.
