                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral PTX and right chest tube  // ptx,
 effusion,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___
 CT torso with contrast from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, small bilateral pneumothoraces are minimally changed.  A
 right chest tube is noted.  Diffuse opacification in the right middle and
 lower lobes likely represents atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are presumed. Multiple rib fractures are again seen.  Previously noted
 subcutaneous emphysema is largely unchanged.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable appearance of small bilateral pneumothoraces status post right chest
 tube placement.
 2. Diffuse opacification in the right middle and lower lobes likely represents
 atelectasis.
 3. Multiple fractures and subcutaneous emphysema are unchanged.
