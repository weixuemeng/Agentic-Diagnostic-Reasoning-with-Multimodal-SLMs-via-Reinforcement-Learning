                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube removal, increasing O2
 requirement, chest pain  // Change in pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, right chest tube has been
 removed, with persistent tiny right apical pneumothorax and small right
 pleural effusion.  On the left, a moderate apical pneumothorax is unchanged,
 but a basilar hydropneumothorax component is more evident, possibly due to
 positional differences between the exams.  Interval improvement in extent of
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No other relevant changes.
