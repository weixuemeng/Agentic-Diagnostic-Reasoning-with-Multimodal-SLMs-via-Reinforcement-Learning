  1.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly, large left-sided pleural effusion, and
  indistinct pulmonary vasculature is compatible with heart failure/ pulmonary
  edema.  No pneumothorax detected.
  
  2.  Left basilar consolidation could also be due to superimposed infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo woman w/ CAD (s/p cath this month, no stents placed), CRF
 on dialysis for a year (T, R, F) and pacemaker is transferred from OSH w/
 elevated LFTs, WBC 17K and c/f acute cholecystitis vs ischemic colitis. Given
 Ceftriaxone, Flagyl at OSH.  Eval for cardiomegaly.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, and there is moderate cardiomegaly, with indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  The
 left-sided pacemaker leads project in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A
 left pleural effusion is moderate, with overlying patchy opacity, potentially
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Streaky right basilar
 atelectasis is mild with associated small right pleural effusion.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.  A vascular stent projects over the left upper lung.  The
 aorta is extensively calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly, moderate left-sided and small right-sided pleural
 effusions, and moderate pulmonary edema, findings compatible with congestive
 heart failure.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 2.  Left basilar patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
