 WET READ: ___ ___:___ PM
  Left PICC at cavoatrial junction.  Persistent patchy bilateral lowr lung zone
  opacities, which allowing for changes in lung volumes, appear similar to the
  prior exam.  Persistent left lobe volume loss and probable small effusion.  No
  pneumothorax.  Lucency overlying the upper abdomen and lower cardiac
  silhouette is of uncertain etiology, and could be dilated distal esophagus
  with air, less likely to be free intraperitoneal air given its location,
  though is a consideration.  Attention on follow-up exams is recommended.
  -___ discussed with Dr. ___ at ___ PM on ___ via telephone by Dr.
  ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with decreased breath sounds on the left,
 decreased oxygen saturations.  Evaluate for aspiration, atelectasis or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC
 near the cavoatrial junction.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Lung volumes are lower with diffuse airspace process and a more focal
 area of consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may represent a
 component of partial lower lobe atelectasis.  No large effusions.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Lucency projecting over the lower cardiac silhouette may
 reflect aeration in spared segment of left lower lobe versus air within a
 distended esophagus.  This can be better assessed on followup imaging.  A wet
 reading was provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at
 9:___ p.m.
