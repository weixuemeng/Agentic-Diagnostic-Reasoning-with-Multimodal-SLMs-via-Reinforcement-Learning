                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after discontinuation of the
 chest tube.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed.
 
 There is small amount of right apical pneumothorax, decreased since the prior
 study.  The suture line is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear.
 
 A rounded opacity projecting over the right lateral chest, most likely reflect
 outside material at the area of previous placement of the chest tube.  Small
 amount of right pleural effusion is noted, unchanged.
