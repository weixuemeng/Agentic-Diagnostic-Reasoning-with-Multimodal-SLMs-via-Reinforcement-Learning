                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Large right pneumothorax status post pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new pigtail catheter which has been placed since the
 prior study.  There is a small pneumothorax.  The apical visceral pleural edge
 measures approximately 2.5 cm from the apex of the chest wall.  A moderate
 pleural effusion has developed where as only a very small fluid component was
 present previously.  For the most part the right lung remains clear although
 it is possible that there may be some degree of atelectasis at the right lung
 base in association with the effusion.  The left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post pigtail pleural catheter drainage tube placement on
 the right.  Small right-sided pneumothorax, somewhat larger than on the prior
 available radiograph, although none that are more recently available.
