                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p right blebectomy and pleurodesis  // R/O
 PTX, one CT removed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  Although ___ ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the last study there is interval increase in the the apical
 pneumothorax, slight with the pneumothorax still being small to moderate, most
 likely related to discontinuation of 1 of the 2 chest tubes in change in the
 position of the second 1. There is otherwise unchanged appearance of the right
 lung base with potentially slight interval increase in pleural effusion. Small
 amount of left pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
