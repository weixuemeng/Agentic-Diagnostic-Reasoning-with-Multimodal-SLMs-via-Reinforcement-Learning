                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracotomy for blebs, question pleurodesis,
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 16:29 p.m.
 
 Again seen are the two right-sided chest tubes and postoperative changes at
 the right lung apex.  No discrete pneumothorax is detected, but the
 possibility of a small right apical pneumothorax would be difficult to
 exclude.  Minimal opacity at the right lung base and atelectasis there is
 again noted.  Doubt overt CHF.  No gross left effusion.  Minimal subcutaneous
 emphysema in the right supraclavicular region is again noted.  Linear density
 to represent an epidural catheter is again noted and should be correlated
 clinically.  There is a segment of this catheter that appears less dense than
 the remaining portions of the structure, similar to several prior films.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No gross change compared with one day earlier.  Tiny right
 pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude.
