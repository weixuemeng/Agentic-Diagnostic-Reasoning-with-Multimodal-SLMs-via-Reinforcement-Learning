                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral images of the chest.  A pacer is seen overlying the
 left anterior chest in a different location than on prior exam, with intact
 leads in appropriate position.  Increased interstitial markings are seen
 bilaterally, consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are seen, left greater than right.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely assessed due to adjacent
 pulmonary effusion, but it appears to be enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.  
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly.
