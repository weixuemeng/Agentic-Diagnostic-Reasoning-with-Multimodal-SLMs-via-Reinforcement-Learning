 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, evaluate for acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Ill-defined airspace opacity in the right lower lung on the frontal view may
 represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes or developing
 consolidation.  There is no lobar consolidation.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, noting
 at the lung apices are obscured by patient's chin.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The descending aorta is
 tortuous.  There is diffuse demineralization.  Partially evaluated posterior
 spinal fusion hardware appears intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Ill-defined right lower lung airspace opacity may represent atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes or developing consolidation.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions without pulmonary edema.
