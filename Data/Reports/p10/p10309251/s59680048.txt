 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is linear left
 basilar opacity most conspicuous on the lateral, but also seen on the frontal
 most suggestive of atelectasis.  Linear opacity also projects anteriorly on
 the lateral view likely due to atelectasis given appearance.  There is no
 focal consolidation suspicious for infection.  There is no large effusion. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities most suggestive of atelectasis, particularly at
 the left lung base.  No focal consolidation worrisome for infection.
