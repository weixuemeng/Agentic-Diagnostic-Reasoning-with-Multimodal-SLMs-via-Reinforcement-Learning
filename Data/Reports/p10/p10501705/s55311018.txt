                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma, status post
 placement of pigtail catheter, check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed with the next preceding
 portable supine chest examination of ___.  Again an almost
 complete left-sided whiteout is noted consistent with large pleural effusion
 probably combined with pulmonary mass as there is no significant shift of the
 mediastinum.  The previously described pigtail catheter is again noted to
 terminate in the lateral pleural space at hilar level.  No pneumothorax is
 seen in the apical area.  The right hemithorax demonstrates normal-appearing
 lung without evidence of congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no significant interval change in
 comparison with next previous study one day earlier.
