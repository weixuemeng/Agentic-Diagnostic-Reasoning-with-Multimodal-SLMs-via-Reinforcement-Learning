                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 9:09 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Question increasing left hemothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to both 5:17 p.m. today and ___:
 
 Right basal atelectasis has nearly cleared and small right pleural effusion is
 stable. Because of rightward patient rotation, it is hard to say whether there
 has been interval rightward mediastinal shift, but I believe there has been,
 suggesting an increase in the volume of the already large left pleural
 effusion that nearly completely collapses the left lung, and obscures
 extensive intrathoracic malignancy as seen on the torso CT earlier today. 
 Bleeding into the left pleural space is certainly possible.  No pneumothorax.
