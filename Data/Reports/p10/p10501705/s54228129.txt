                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left PleurX catheter placement, tachypnea.  Please evaluate
 catheter placement and residual pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of the
 chest tube with tip difficult to evaluate but appears to be along the left
 base.  There is increased dense opacification of the left hemithorax with air
 bronchograms present in the retrocardiac position.  Increased density likely
 combination of known large left upper lobe mass as well as increased left
 lower lobe collapse and increased left pleural effusion.  Right mediastinal
 and hilar borders are unremarkable.  Right lung is clear.  The right-sided
 pleural effusion evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of chest tube.  Increased dense opacification
 of the left lower lobe, likely combination of large mass, increased effusion
 and left lower lobe collapse.
