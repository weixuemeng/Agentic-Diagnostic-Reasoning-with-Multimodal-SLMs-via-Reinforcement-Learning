 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:56 PM
  NO PNEUMOTHORAX. COMPLETE OPACIFICATION OF THE LEFT LUNG REMAINS STABLE.
  HOWEVER, THERE IS INTERVAL INCREASED OPACIFICATION OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE
  WITH A PATTERN SUGGESTIVE OF BOTH ATELECTASIS AND EFFUSION. THE SHORT INTERVAL
  OPACIFICATION OF THE RIGHT LUNG AGAIN RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF A HEMOTHORAX
  AND AS A RESULT, SHORT INTERVAL CONTINUED FOLLOWUP IS RECOMMENDED.
  FINDINGS DISCUSSED BY DR. ___ WITH DR. ___ ___ TELEPHONE AT 5:50 PM ON

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:15 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent thoracentesis, question increasing left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___, at 4:26 p.m.
 
 Large left pleural effusion and worsening left lung atelectasis combine to
 opacify nearly all of the left hemithorax, with less aeration now than on
 ___.  It is difficult to say whether there is more pleural fluid,
 since the mediastinum does not appear to have been shifted more into the right
 hemithorax despite worsening right lower lobe atelectasis, accompanied by
 increase in a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  Heart size of course
 is indeterminate.  No pneumothorax.  Careful followup is advised.
