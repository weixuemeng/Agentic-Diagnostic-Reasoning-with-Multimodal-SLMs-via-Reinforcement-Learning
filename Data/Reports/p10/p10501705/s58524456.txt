                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of opacification
 in the left hemithorax has increased.  However, this could relate to a
 redistribution of pleural fluid in the supine position, when compared to the
 upright PA view in the comparison study.  Nevertheless, there certainly does
 not appear to be any substantial reduction in the degree of pleural fluid.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 This information was discussed with Dr. ___, who is covering for Dr.
 ___, by telephone at 4:30 on ___.  The idea that this could reflect
 bleeding into the hemithorax following the procedure, especially in a patient
 with poor clotting status, was discussed.  An attempt will be made to take an
 upright portable view that would be better comparable to the prior study. 
 This also would be of value to detect whether there is any pneumothorax.  The
 house officers will closely monitor the patient this evening for any signs of
 intrathoracic hemorrhage.
