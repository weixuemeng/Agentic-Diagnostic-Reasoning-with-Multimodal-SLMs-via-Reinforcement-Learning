                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer.  Pigtail catheter placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Despite the left pigtail pleural drain hugging the left chest wall, large left
 pleural effusion has increased since ___, and the left lung is found
 nearly entirely airless.  The increase in left pleural fluid volume accounts
 for return of the mediastinum to the midline, previously in the left
 hemithorax.  Small right pleural effusion is likely present, but the right
 lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.
