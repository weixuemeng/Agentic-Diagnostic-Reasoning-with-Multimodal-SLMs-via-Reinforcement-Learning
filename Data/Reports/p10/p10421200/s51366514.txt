                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary pathology
 including pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Vascular crowding due to low lung volumes is responsible for
 increased opacity of the lower lungs.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal size allowing for decreased lung volumes.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are likewise within normal limits.  The trachea
 is midline.  An irregular rope-like density projecting over the right neck
 likely represents hair artifact or material external to the patient.  The
 visualized upper abdomen shows tubing related to a lap band, similar in
 appearance to the prior ___ study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Low lung
 volumes.
