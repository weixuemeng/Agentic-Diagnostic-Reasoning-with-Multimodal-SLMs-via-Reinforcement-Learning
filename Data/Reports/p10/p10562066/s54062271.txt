                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, in particular the left ventricle but unchanged. 
 Mediastinum is unchanged, unremarkable.  Lungs are clear with no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view demonstrates unchanged appearance
 of bulging of the posterior aspect of the diaphragm, most likely representing
 small hiatal hernia.  Pleural lesion is a possibility.  The abnormality has
 not changed since the prior study and thus most likely represents benign
 finding.
