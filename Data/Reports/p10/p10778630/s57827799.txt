                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with disseminated malignancy, hypoxemia s/p
 cervical lymph node biopsy  // Evaluate for aspiration, atelectasis, pneumonia
 Evaluate for aspiration, atelectasis, pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large region of opacification at the base of the right lung could be
 pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration.  There is a smaller region of
 consolidation on the left.  Without a lateral view however it is impossible to
 know how much of the opacification in the right lower chest is due to pleural
 effusion which would obscure and could mimic pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.  Upper lungs are grossly clear.
