                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has increased.  There is no evidence of pneumonia in the lung
 parenchyma but scarring has developed at the apical aspect of the middle lobe
 and the bases of the middle lobe.  The scarring is better appreciated on the
 frontal than on the lateral radiograph.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. 
 Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without fluid overload.  Mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.
