                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from the
 same day.
 
 PORTABLE AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Chronic right-sided pleural
 effusion appears unchanged compared to ___.  However, there is new pulmonary
 vascular congestion, and increased density at the lung bases which may reflect
 increasing pleural fluid bilaterally or possibly bilateral atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.  Perihilar
 enlargement and indistinctness corresponds with edema.  Evaluation of the
 cardiac silhouette is limited due to bibasalir opacities.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic right pleural effusion.
 2.  No new pulmonary vascular congestion and probable increasing bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 3.  Bibasilar consolidations may reflect compressive atelectasis, though
 aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.
