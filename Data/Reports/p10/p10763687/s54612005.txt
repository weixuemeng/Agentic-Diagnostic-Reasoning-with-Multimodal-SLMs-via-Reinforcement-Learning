                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were provided.  There is a moderate right
 pleural effusion, similar in extent to the prior study.  Well demarcated
 linear opacity at the right base has the configuration of atelectasis;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.  There is mild prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unchanged.  Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate right pleural effusion. 
 2.  Right basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis; however, infection cannot be
 excluded.
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
