                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dysphagia, cough with likely
 pneumonia but portable film not definitely showing infiltrate.  Possible
 aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Available for comparison is a preceding AP
 single view chest examination of ___.  There is marked cardiac
 enlargement.  No typical configurational abnormality can be identified.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated without evidence of local
 contour abnormalities.  Diaphragms are relatively high positioned and
 resulting in crowded appearance of the pulmonary basal vasculature with
 evidence of a few linear densities compatible with atelectases.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates perivascular haze throughout, but there is no
 evidence of discrete peripheral parenchymal infiltrates indicating pneumonia. 
 No pneumothorax seen in the apical area.  The lateral view discloses
 significant pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior pleural sinuses. 
 When comparison is made with a preceding examination of ___,
 findings indicative of left-sided CHF with pleural effusion have progressed. 
 Previous examination could not establish a pleural effusion in detail as no
 lateral view has been obtained.
