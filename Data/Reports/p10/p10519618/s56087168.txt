 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aspiration and intubation, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip 3.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 courses into the left upper abdomen with its tip just beyond the GE junction. 
 There is effusion on the right, which layers posteriorly.  There is a small
 left effusion.  There is vague opacity in the right mid and lower lung, which
 could represent in part layering fluid, though the possibility of pneumonia is
 not excluded.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral effusions, right greater than left with possible
 consolidation in the right mid and lower lung.
