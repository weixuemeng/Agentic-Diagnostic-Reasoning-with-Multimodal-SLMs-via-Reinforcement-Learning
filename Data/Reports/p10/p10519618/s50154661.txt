                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette with upper airway noises.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss
 in the lower lobe and hazy opacification at the bases consistent with layering
 effusions.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Impression on the right side of the upper thoracic trachea could possibly
 represent a substernal thyroid.
