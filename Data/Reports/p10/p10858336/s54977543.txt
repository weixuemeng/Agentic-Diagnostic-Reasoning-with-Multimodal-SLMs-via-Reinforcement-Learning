  No evidence of acute disease.  Relatively wide right-sided paratracheal
  stripe, probably a normal variant, but if correlation with prior films is not
  available to show long-term stability, then a chest CT is recommended to
  assess further when clinically appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The right-sided
 mediastinal stripe is mildly widened.  Although this appearance is most often
 due to tortuosity of the great vessels, prior studies are not available to
 show stability.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes involve the acromioclavicular
 joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Relatively wide right-sided
 paratracheal stripe, probably a normal variant, but if correlation with prior
 films is not available to show long-term stability, then a chest CT is
 recommended to assess further.
