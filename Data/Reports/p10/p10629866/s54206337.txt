                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:12 and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size remains mildly enlarged, but this may be
 accentuated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No definite focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflective of atelectasis. If there is concern for pneumonia,
 consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort.
