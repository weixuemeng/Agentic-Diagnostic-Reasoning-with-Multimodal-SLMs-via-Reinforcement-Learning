                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, evaluate for acute
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is cardiomegaly, stable since ___.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Diffuse reticular
 nodular changes persist.  Bibasilar opacification appears more pronounced on
 today's study compared to the most recent prior examination and likely
 represents bibasilar atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Apical pleural thickening
 and opacification along the right upper lung zone, appears slightly more
 pronounced on today's study and may represent infectious etiology in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles
 may represent trace pleural effusion.
