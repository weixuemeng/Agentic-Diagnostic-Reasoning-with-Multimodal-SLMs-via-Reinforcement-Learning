 EFFUSION,CONSOLIDATION,RIB FX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to most recent prior chest radiographs, ___.
 
 Small left pleural effusion and the extent of nodular pleural thickening along
 the left lower costal pleural surface are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  New rib views, to be reported separately, show no obvious bone
 destruction, but early invasion from the pleural surface might not be apparent
 on conventional chest radiographs but would require CT scanning instead.
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Aside from a
 calcified right lower lobe granuloma, small region of right apical scarring,
 and stable left basal atelectasis, lungs are clear.
 
 Thoracic aorta is tortuous and the lower esophagus is distended.
