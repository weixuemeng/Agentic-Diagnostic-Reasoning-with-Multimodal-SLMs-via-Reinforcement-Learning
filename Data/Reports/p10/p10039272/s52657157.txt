                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right middle lobe opacity has partially cleared.  Lungs are
 otherwise remarkable for unchanged calcified granulomas in the right mid and
 lower lung as well as an area of apparent pleural and parenchymal scarring in
 the periphery of the right apex.  Localized scar or atelectasis is also
 demonstrated at the left lung base, with similar appearance to the prior
 radiograph.  Lateral left costophrenic angle remains mildly blunted.  Bones
 are remarkable for diffuse osseous demineralization, consistent with the
 patient's advanced age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacity has partially improved.  An additional
 followup chest radiograph in four weeks is recommended to document complete
 resolution.
