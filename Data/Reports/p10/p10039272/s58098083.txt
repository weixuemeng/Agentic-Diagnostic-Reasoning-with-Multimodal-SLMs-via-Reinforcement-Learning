                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the left pleural effusion is larger and there
 is some underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 The patient apparently had a prior right middle lobe pneumonia, and faint
 residua is seen in that location, improved compared with ___. Minimal
 scarring in the right upper lung is unchanged. The right lung is otherwise
 grossly clear.  No right-sided effusion.  Thickening of the fissure or
 plate-like atelectasis is seen on the lateral view.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. The aorta is unfolded. 
 Mild prominence of the hila with a tapered appearance suggests an element of
 pulmonary hypertension.   No CHF. 
 
 Scattered calcified granulomas are again noted.   Clips noted to the right of
 the thyroid.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improving right middle lobe pneumonia, with mild residual opacity.
 
 2.  Worsening left lower lobe effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Possibility of a new site of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly and probable pulmonary hypertension.  Background COPD noted.
 
 4.  Right upper zone scarring, not fully characterized.  No definite
 associated nodular opacity.  However, further evaluation with chest CT could
 be considered.
 
 Item #4 submitted to critical results dashboard.
