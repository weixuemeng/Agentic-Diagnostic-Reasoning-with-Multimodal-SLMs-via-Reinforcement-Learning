                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea and chest pain  // Pneumonia? Effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is vague opacity projecting over the left lung which has increased since
 ___.  Given findings on prior PET, this may be due known underlying
 mesothelioma.  Elsewhere, lungs are grossly clear besides right basilar
 calcified granulomas and biapical scarring cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is again noted.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity projecting over the left mid lung which is new since prior but
 may be due to known underlying mesothelioma as opposed to new underlying
 parenchymal process although this would be difficult to exclude entirely.
