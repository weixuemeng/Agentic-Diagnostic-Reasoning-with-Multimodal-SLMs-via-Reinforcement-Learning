                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with R IJ line placement  // line placement, PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line terminating
 within the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Again seen is an endotracheal
 tube now terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of the carina.  A new
 upper enteric drainage tube ends in the stomach. Diffuse, heterogeneous
 bilateral airspace opacities predominantly affect the perihilar upper and mid
 lungs, essentially unchanged.  Widening of the mediastinum particularly in the
 right paratracheal station could be distended vasculature, exaggerated in the
 supine position, or adenopathy or both. There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter terminating in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
 2. Endotracheal tube terminating 6 cm above the level of the carina.
 3. Stable, diffuse airspace opacities which may represent pulmonary edema,
 ARDS, multifocal pneumonia ; elements of pulmonary hemorrhage or metastasis
 may be present.
 4.  Mediastinal widening, particularly rib right paratracheal station could be
 dilated vasculature or adenopathy.
