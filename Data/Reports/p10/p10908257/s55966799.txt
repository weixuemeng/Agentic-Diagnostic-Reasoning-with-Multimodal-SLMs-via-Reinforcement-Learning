 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, a right-sided Port-A-Cath has been placed, tip

 water bottle configuration of the heart is unchanged and is consistent with a
 smallpericarical effusion as seen on the chest CT from ___, but also

 Possible mild increase in the degree of atelectasis at the lung bases, but no
 definite new infiltrate identified.
