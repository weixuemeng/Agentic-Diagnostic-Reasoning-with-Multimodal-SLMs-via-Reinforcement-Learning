                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of AFib and fevers with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 confluent consolidation, effusion, or pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is
 moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild compression
 deformity is seen in the mid thoracic spine which is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which may be due to cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion is also possible.  Consider echocardiogram.
 2.  Mild height loss of a mid thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate and
 clinical correlation is suggested.
