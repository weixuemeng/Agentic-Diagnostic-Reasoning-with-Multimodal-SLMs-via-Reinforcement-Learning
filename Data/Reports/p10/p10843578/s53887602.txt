 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low but the lungs are grossly clear without
 obvious consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but this is
 likely in part due to AP technique and low lung volumes.  Severe degenerative
 changes noted at the shoulders bilaterally, worse on the left.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
