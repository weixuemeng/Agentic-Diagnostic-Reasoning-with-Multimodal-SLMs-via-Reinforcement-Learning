 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle opacity
 projecting over the lateral right mid hemithorax is stable as compared to the
 prior study and may relate to overlapping structures.  No new focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable, as are the
 hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.
