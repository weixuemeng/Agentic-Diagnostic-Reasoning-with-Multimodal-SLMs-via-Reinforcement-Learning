 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Tortuous aorta is seen in descending
 portion.  Upper lungs are clear.  Right basal opacity most likely representing
 linear atelectasis and appears to be unchanged as compared to prior study. 
 Left lower lung is essentially clear.  Minimal amount of pleural effusion
 appears to be similar to the prior study and alternatively might represent
 area of pleural thickening.  Slight leftward deviation of the trachea and mild
 narrowing at its superior portion is redemonstrated due to slight enlargement
 of the right thyroid gland as demonstrated on the CT neck from ___.
