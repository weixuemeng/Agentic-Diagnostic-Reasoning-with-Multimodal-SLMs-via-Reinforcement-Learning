                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, bilateral
 moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette cannot be well evaluated due to these other findings, but the heart
 does not appear enlarged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also noted
 with some fluid within the minor fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
