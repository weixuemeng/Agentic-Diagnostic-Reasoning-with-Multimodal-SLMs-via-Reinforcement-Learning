                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with shortness of breath
 and question pneumonia versus congestive heart failure with persistently low
 saturations.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 There is interval development/progression of the right mid and lower lobe
 consolidation  which most likely represents a combination of atelectasis and
 potentially infectious process.  Small amount of pleural effusion is present. 
 Right mediastinal shift is explained by the atelectasis, which most likely
 involves right middle and lower lobes.  There is also left lower lobe opacity
 although slightly improved since the prior study.  There is no evidence of
 appreciable pulmonary edema.
