                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right lung base pneumonia on CXR on ___,
 please eval for interval change  // please eval for interval change in RLL
 pneumonia     please eval for interval change in RLL pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some decrease in
 opacification at the right base, again worrisome for pneumonia.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, possibly a manifestation of improved lung
 volumes.  At the left base, the hemidiaphragm is poorly seen medially with
 mild opacification above the its lateral aspect.  This could represent
 atelectasis, though in view of the changes on the right multifocal pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 There is an placement of a left IJ catheter with its tip in the mid to lower
 SVC.
