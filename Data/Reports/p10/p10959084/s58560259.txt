 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size, which is
 top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable except for
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged is hardware within the right humeral
 head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Low lung volumes.
