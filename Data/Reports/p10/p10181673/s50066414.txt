 CXR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has largely cleared from the upper lobes, and
 the residual opacification in the lower lobes could be explained by
 atelectasis and dependent edema, but should be followed to exclude concurrent
 pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion has increased.  No pneumothorax.  Mild
 to moderate cardiomegaly stable.
