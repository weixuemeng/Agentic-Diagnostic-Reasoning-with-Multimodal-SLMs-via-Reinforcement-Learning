                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and TAVR.  Mild enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with a left ventricular predominance is re-
 demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected however the lung apices are obscured by the patient's chin and neck
 projecting over these regions.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.  Multiple clips project over the region of the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities within the lung bases, likely atelectasis.  Infection,
 however, is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
