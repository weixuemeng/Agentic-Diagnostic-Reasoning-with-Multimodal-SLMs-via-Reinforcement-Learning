                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON STUDIES.  Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful
 to detect subtle interval change.
 
 A single portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coiled within the stomach.  A catheter overlying this
 location appears to be heading cephalad off the edge of the image but is felt
 to most likely be related to the balloon of the endotracheal tube as
 discussion with the patient's nurse, ___, confirms that the patient
 does not have any central venous access. 
 
 2. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits
 given portable technique. Lung volumes are relatively low with no evidence of
 pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely reflects a small effusion or scarring. 
 Calcification within the lateral neck soft tissues on the left may be carotid
 in etiology.  
 
 3. Clips in the right upper quadrant likely reflect prior cholecystectomy. 
 Calcifications in the left upper quadrant likely represent splenic arterial
 calcifications.
