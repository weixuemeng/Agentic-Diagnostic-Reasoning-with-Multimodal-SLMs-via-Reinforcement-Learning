                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post left IJ placement.  Evaluate for
 line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed a left IJ approach central venous catheter tip projects over
 the expected region of the cavoatrial junction.  A left single lead pacer
 defibrillator tip projects over the expected region of the right atrium. 
 Cardiac valve replacement, median sternotomy wires, and mediastinal clips are
 unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 bilaterally suggests small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax or
 frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Newly placed left IJ approach central venous catheter tip projects over
 the expected region of the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes.
 3.  Persist and bilateral small pleural effusions.
