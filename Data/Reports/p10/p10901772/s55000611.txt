                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve
 replacement.  Right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates at the
 junction of the SVC and right atrium.  Left-sided AICD device is noted with
 single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, new in the interval.  Worsening patchy opacity
 in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis.  There are likely trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Worsening right basilar patchy opacity, potentially atelectasis. 
 Infection, however, is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
