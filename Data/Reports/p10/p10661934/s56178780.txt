                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML, on chemotherapy, presenting with febrile neutropenia, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 A PICC line is present, tip overlying distal SVC. No ptx.  
 
 There is slight crowding of vessels at the left lung base, not seen on the
 ___ radiograph.  While this could represent a small amount of
 atelectasis, in this scenario, the possibility of an early infectious
 infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No definite corresponding abnormality
 seen on the lateral view and there is no frank consolidation.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No CHF or  effusion
 is detected.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy is identified.  Osseous structures grossly
 unremarkable
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Minimal patchy opacity at the left base, ? atelectasis, though early
 infectious infiltrate is in the differential.
 2) PICC line tip overlying distal SVC.  
 3) Chest x-ray examination otherwise within normal limits.
