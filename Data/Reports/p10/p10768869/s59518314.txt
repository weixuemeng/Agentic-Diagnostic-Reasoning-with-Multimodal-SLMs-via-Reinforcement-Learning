                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Sinus tachycardia, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen in
 the upper-to-mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
