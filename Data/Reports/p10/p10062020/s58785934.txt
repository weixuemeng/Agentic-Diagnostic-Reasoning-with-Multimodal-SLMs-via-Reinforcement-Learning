                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated CRP.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation.  Additionally the left lung
 apex is obscured due to overlying soft tissue from the patient's neck and
 chin.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  Calcifications of the aortic
 arch are present.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacity in the retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis, but infection is
 not excluded.  Eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is noted.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is diffuse demineralization
 of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to patient rotation.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.
