                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with colon ca  // worsening dyspnea and wheezing,
 please evaluate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___, and CT chest
 with contrast obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen a right-sided port with distal tip in stable position in
 the lower SVC.
 
 There is extrinsic compression of the extrathoracic trachea with marked
 narrowing of the airway, consistent with previously described right arytenoid
 lesion seen on CT in ___. There is widening of the right paratracheal
 stripe which suggests paratracheal adenopathy, as well as bilateral right
 greater than left hilar prominence consistent with known hilar
 lymphadenopathy, as seen on recent CT. The cardiac silhouette is normal.
 
 There are again seen multiple nodular opacities throughout both lungs,
 increased in both number and size in comparison to recent CT scan on ___. Again seen is the right lower lobe dominant nodular opacity surrounding
 the fiducial marker, which appears to have increased in size in comparison to
 recent CT. These findings are consistent with progressive metastatic disease.
 
 There are no additional focal lung consolidations or opacities concerning for
 superimposed or secondary process such as pneumonia.  There are no
 pneumothoraces or effusions.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion or edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Extrinsic compression of extrathoracic trachea with marked narrowing,
 consistent with previously described right arytenoid lesion. Recommend direct
 visualization for further assessment if not yet performed.
 2.  Increase in number and size of multiple bilateral metastatic lung nodules,
 including increase in size of right lower lobe dominant mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone with Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:38, approximately 10 minutes after
 discovery.
