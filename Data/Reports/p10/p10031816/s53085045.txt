 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right lung fiducial seed placement and biopsy, questionable
 pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a fiducial seed was placed
 in the right lower lung.  The previously placed left Port-A-Cath has been
 removed and replaced by a right Port-A-Cath.  There currently is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Small parenchymal scar at the left lung bases, unchanged as
 compared to the previous exam.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pleural effusions.
