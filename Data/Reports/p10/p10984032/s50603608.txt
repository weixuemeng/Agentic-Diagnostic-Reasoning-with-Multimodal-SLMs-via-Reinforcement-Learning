 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities
 on the right are minimally progressive, notably at the right lung apex.  On
 the left, the lung parenchyma has increased in transparency, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation.  Moderate cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis
 persist.  Unchanged position of the right Port-A-Cath.
