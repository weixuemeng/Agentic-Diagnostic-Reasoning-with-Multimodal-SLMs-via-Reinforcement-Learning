                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly is noted with moderate pulmonary edema and small
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  A right subclavian central
 venous catheter is again noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is also a
 dense opacity in the posterior left lower lobe suggesting atelectasis but
 possibly pneumonia combined with effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Focal opacity in the posterior left lobe lobe, which may be
 explained by atelectasis perhaps associated with a pleural effusion, but
 coinciding developing infection is also possible.
