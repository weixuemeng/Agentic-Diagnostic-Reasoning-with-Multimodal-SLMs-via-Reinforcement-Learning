                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, suspect pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Layering bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Retrocardiac fullness seen on
 the lateral view is probably a combination of hiatus hernia and descending
 thoracic aorta.  Although very small areas of pneumonia cannot be excluded,
 the lesion at the lateral aspect of the left lung base is conceivably
 atelectasis.  Small nodular opacity projects over the left supraclavicular
 region but could be apical pleuroparenchymal scarring.  Heart is not enlarged.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  It would be very
 helpful to compare this study with prior chest radiographs whenever available.
