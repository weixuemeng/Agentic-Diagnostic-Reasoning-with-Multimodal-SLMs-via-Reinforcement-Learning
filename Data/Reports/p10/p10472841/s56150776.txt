                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after total hip replacement
 with fever, chills, and cellulitis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is a slight interval decrease in right upper lobe
 opacity that potentially might reflect improvement of right upper lobe
 infectious process.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Slight right
 mediastinal shift most likely related to substantial bilateral, left more than
 right emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
