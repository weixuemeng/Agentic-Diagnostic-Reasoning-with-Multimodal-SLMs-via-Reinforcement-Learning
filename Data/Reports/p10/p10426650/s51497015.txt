                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube removal  // s/p CT removal-
 Please do at 4pm      s/p CT removal- Please do at 4pm
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, of the left chest tube is
 been removed. Small apical pneumothorax persists.  Increased opacification at
 the left base is most consistent with pleural effusion and compressive basilar
 atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered. Less prominent changes are seen at the
 right base.
