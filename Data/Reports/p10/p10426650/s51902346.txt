 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the chest tube on
 water seal there is no definite pneumothorax.  Increased opacification at the
 left base could reflect pulmonary hemorrhage or developing aspiration or
 pneumonia. Less prominent area of increased opacification is seen at the right
 base medially.  There is still dilatation of the gas-filled stomach after
 removal of the nasogastric tube.
