                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with ETOH cirrhosis with upper GI bleed with
 acute renal failure, assess Dobbhoff placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is not included in this exam.  Right IJ catheter tip is in
 the lower SVC, unchanged.  New right middle lobe collapse.  Widened
 mediastinum is unchanged.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  Extensive
 opacities in the right lung and perihilar consolidation have improved.  Left
 lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have increased.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are probably present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal consolidations due to suspected multifocal pneumonia and
 improvement of pulmonary edema.
 2.  New collapse of the right middle lobe and increased volume loss in the
 right lower lobe.
