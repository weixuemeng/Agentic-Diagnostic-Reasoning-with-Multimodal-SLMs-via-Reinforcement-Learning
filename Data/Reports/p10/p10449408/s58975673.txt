                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 546 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Dobbhoff tube, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 548 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC.  The
 Dobbhoff feeding tube remains below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within
 the stomach.  A round calcification in the right upper quadrant likely
 represents a calcified gallstone.  There continues to be a diffuse bilateral
 airspace and interstitial abnormality with more focal changes in the right mid
 to upper lung where there is a suggestion of honeycombing more peripherally. 
 These findings most likely are consistent with underlying interstitial lung
 disease with superimposed pulmonary edema given that the findings are
 fluctuating over serial radiographs.  A superimposed infection would be less
 likely.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient positioning between studies.  No pneumothorax.
