 INDICATION:   ___M s/p intubation  // eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam from earlier the same day at 07:16.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is now seen with tip approximately 2 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube tip in the region of the distal esophagus superior to the GE
 junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning. Linear opacity in the
 right midlung and in the retrocardiac region, potentialy atelectasis. The
 lungs are otherwise grossly clear given the relatively low lung volumes. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip approximately 2 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip
 just proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced.
