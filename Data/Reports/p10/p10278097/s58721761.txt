                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and irregular heart rate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This slightly
 limits assessment of lung bases where there are streaky opacities likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
