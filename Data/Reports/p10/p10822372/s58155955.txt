                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with tachypnea, status post recent treatment
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous chest
 x-ray from ___ and older exams dating back to ___.
 
 Again seen is a large hiatal hernia with air-fluid levels within intrathoracic
 bowel loops, both on the left and on the right.  Where visualized, the lungs
 are again notable for patchy opacity in the right midlung, grossly uchanged. 
 Assessment for pleural effusions; however, or lower lobe disease is limited
 secondary to large hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam given massive hiatal hernia.  Possible residual
 right mid lung consolidation.  However, no significant change from prior.  CT
 may be necessary for more detailed evaluation.
