                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of restrictive lung disease, now
 with worsening dyspnea, wheezing, and cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show new opacities in
 the right mid lung consistent with pneumonia.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 mildly engorged.  Evaluation of the lung bases is limited due to low
 inspiratory lung volumes and a massive but stable hiatal hernia.  The lung
 apices are well aerated without pneumothorax.  Rightward deviation of the
 trachea is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed.  The
 thoracic spine is kyphotic with severe degenerative changes.  Large, dense
 calcifications are noted in the bilateral breasts, unchanged from diagnostic
 mammogram of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pneumonia of the right lung.
 2.  Stable massive hiatal hernia.
