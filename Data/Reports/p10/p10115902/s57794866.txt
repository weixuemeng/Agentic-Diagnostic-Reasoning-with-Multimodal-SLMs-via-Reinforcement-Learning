                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac size is accentuated by low lung volumes and appears mildly enlarged,
 slightly increased in size compared to prior exam likely due to differences in
 technique. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Assessment for a
 pleural effusion is slightly limited as the costophrenic angles were not
 completely imaged on the frontal view, but there appears to be minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view which may
 be due to tiny pleural effusions or chronic pleural thickening, as seen on the
 previous exam. No pneumothorax is identified. Moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes are re- demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
