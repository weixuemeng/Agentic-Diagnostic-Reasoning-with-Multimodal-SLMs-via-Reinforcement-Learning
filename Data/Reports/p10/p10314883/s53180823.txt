                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Allowing for this factor, cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and without change since the prior study. 
 With the exception of a new linear opacity in the right mid lung region, the
 lungs appear clear, with no focal areas of consolidation.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  Scoliosis is again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal linear atelectasis within the right middle lobe.  No areas
 of consolidation to suggest an acute pneumonia.
