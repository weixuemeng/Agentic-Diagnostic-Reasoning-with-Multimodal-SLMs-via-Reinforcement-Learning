                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Post-surgical changes are again seen, though the right IJ sheath
 has been removed.  Opacification persists at the left base, consistent with
 pleural fluid and left lower lobe atelectatic change.  Small right pleural
 effusion is also appreciated on the lateral view.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
