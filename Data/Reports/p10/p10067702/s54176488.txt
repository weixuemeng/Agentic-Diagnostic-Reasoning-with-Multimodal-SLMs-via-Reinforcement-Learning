                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung adenocarcinoma status post thoracotomy in ___
 presents with 10 days of cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___. 
 CT of the chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Postoperative changes in
 the right lung are unchanged.  Following right upper lobectomy there is
 unchanged mild rightward shift of the mediastinal structures.  A surgical clip
 in the region of the right mediastinum is again noted and likely secondary to
 prior mediastinal lymph node dissection.  The heart is normal in size and the
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There are no focal consolidations to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-surgical changes without evidence of pneumonia.
