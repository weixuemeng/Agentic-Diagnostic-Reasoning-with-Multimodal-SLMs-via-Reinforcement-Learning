                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY 
 
 INDICATION:  MVC, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam compared to a chest x-ray and a CT scan from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the last exam, the patient has been extubated.  The NG tube
 has been removed.  The left apical and axillary pleural effusion with the
 small pneumothorax is unchanged.  Stability of the left lower lung atelectasis
 since the last chest x ray, but that has progressed since the previous CT
 scan.  Small radiolucencies are seen adjacent to the left border of the heart
 that are compatible with the laceration visible on the CT scan.  Amelioration
 of the left lung opacities suggestive of contusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contour are normal.  The left scapular fracture is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 1.Mild left pneumothorax with unchanged small pleural effusion.  
 2.Atelectasis of the left lower lobe 
 3.Stable left lower lobe laceration
