                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  MVC with pulmonary contusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left upper lobe alveolar opacities are better today.  They were
 compatible with contusion.  Stability of the mild apical and axillary left
 pleural effusion.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  The left lower lobe
 atelectasis is still present; however, there seems to be a slight left
 mediastinal shift since the previous exam, possibly because of the rotation of
 the patient, but a progression of the atelectasis can also be considered. The
 radiolucencies that were adjacent to the left cardiac border are better: they
 are possibly compatible with laceration.  The right lung is normal.  Stability
 of the undisplaced left scapular fracture.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Amelioration of the left lung contusions.  The radiolucencies in the left
 lower lung that were described yesterday possibly compatible with lacerations
 are better today.
 2.  No pneumothorax.  The mild left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 3.  Possible slight mediastinal shift on the left secondary to a progression
 of the left lower lobe atelectasis versus displacement only due to the
 position and rotation of the patient.
