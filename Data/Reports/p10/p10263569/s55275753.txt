 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:55 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the PICC line
 now projects over the mid-to-lower SVC.  There is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The transparency of the lungs at the
 level of the left lung base has substantially improved.
