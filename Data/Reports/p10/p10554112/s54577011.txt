                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  For CT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Left chest tube is in
 place following violation of the pleura during surgery.  No definite
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Diffuse pulmonary opacifications most likely
 reflects overhydration with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm could reflect some volume loss in the left
 lower lobe with pleural fluid.  Air bronchograms behind the heart could
 conceivably reflect a consolidation or aspiration in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
