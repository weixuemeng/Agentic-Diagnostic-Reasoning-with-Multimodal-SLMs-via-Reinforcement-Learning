                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with multifocal
 consolidations.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 As compared to the prior study, the extent of the multifocal consolidations is
 similar in the right lung but potentially slightly worse on the left,
 predominantly involving mid and lower lung zones, again concerning for
 multifocal infection.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  ARDS
 would be another possibility.
 
 Bilateral breast prosthesis is redemonstrated.
