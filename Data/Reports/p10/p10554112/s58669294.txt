                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent ARDS status post extubation with persistent hypoxemia. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a right PICC with the
 tip in the mid to low SVC.  There has been improvement of generalized
 opacities, now with asymmetric increased opacity of the left mid-lower lungs. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, and there are again probable
 small pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement of generalized opacities, except for a region of increased opacity
 of the left mid-lower lungs, representing either asymmetric resolution of ARDS
 or ARDS coexisting with pneumonia.
