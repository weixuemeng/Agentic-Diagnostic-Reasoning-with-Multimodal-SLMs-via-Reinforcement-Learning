                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ARDS with recent urologic surgery.  Evaluate for interval change
 and assess endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.7 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A right PICC ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. 
 An enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the mid
 stomach.  The sidehole is slightly below the expected level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  There are widespread bilateral opacities, more
 severe at the lung bases, overall similar to the most recent radiograph from
 ___, aside from in the left mid to lower lung where the
 opacities have increased.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased consolidative left mid to lower lung opacities, with the
 remainder bilateral widespread opacities being essentially unchanged,
 consistent with ARDS.
 
 2.  Enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, although the
 sidehole is slightly below the gastroesophageal junction.  Advancement is
 recommended.
