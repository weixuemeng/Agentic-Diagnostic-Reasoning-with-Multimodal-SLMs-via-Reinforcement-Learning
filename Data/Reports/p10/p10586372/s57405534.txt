                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest and back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Subsegmental atelectasis is demonstrated within the right lower
 lobe.  Focal opacity within the lower lobe posteriorly on the lateral view,
 likely within the right lower lobe is present.  There is an associated small
 right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Posterior lower lobe opacity noted on the lateral view is likely within the
 right lower lobe and may reflect an area of infarction or infection.  Small
 right pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
