 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, leukocytosis, assess for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright frontal and lateral views of the chest are provided
 demonstrate bibasilar plate-like atelectasis.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the
 right upper lung, which could represent a pulmonary nodule and non-emergent CT
 may be obtained to further assess.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or
 CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with top normal heart size.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with lower lung atelectasis.  Vague nodular
 opacity in the right upper lung for which non-emergent CT of the chest can be
 performed to further assess for pulmonary nodule.
