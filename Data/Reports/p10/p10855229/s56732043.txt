                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC terminates in the expected location of the lower
 superior vena cava, and has a similar course and location to the prior study
 of ___  allowing for differences in lung volumes and the
 presence of rotation.  Low lung volumes accentuate cardiomediastinal contours
 and result in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  There has been apparent
 slight worsening of bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, and a
 questionable small left pleural effusion.
