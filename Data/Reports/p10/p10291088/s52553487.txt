                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval resolution of multifocal consolidations. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is persistently prominent and heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Increased density at the right lung base appears unchanged.  The
 aorta is calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of multifocal consolidations with persistent
 cardiomegaly.  Opacity at the right lung base likely reflects chronic
 interstitial change.
