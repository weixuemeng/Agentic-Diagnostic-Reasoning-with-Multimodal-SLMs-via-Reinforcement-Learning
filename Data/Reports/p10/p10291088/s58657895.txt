                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and multiple chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, likely exaggerated
 by AP technique.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate a mildly tortuous aorta
 with calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The lungs again
 demonstrate a prominent reticular pattern particulary at the bases without
 clear evidence of new consolidation.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial lung disease, but no definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
