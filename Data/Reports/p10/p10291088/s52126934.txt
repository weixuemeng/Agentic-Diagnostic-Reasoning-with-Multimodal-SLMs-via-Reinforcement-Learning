                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with wheezing and question developing
 pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:01.
 
 A portable erect chest film ___ at 4:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although
 somewhat obscured by the diffuse airspace process, which has worsened.  Given
 the change, this would favor worsening pulmonary edema, although a diffuse
 pneumonia should also be considered.  Small bilateral effusions are less well
 visualized on the current examination.  No pneumothorax.
