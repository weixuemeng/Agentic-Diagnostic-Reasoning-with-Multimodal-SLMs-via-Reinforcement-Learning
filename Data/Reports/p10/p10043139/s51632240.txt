                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or
 congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded. In the right apex there is an
 irregular linear opacity without clear lung markings above this line raising
 concern for a small pneumothorax. No left sided pneumothorax is seen. Patchy
 and linear opacities are noted in the both lung bases, left worse than right,
 with associated bilateral pleural effusions, left worse than right as well. 
 Widened mediastinum is present and may be a combination of prominent fat and
 vascular structures. Enlarged cardiac silhouette may reflect cardiomegaly
 and/or pericardial effusion. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are from
 prior surgery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Probable small right apical pneumothorax. Repeat chest radiograph is
 recommended to exclude enlarging pneumothorax.
 2.  Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities, which may be secondary to
 atelectasis, pneumonia, or aspiration. Adjacent small pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.
 
 Item 1 of the Impression was addedd after review with the attending for which
 the ___ nurse was informed to have the findings communicated to the PCP of the
 patient on ___ at 9 am via e-mail by Dr ___.
