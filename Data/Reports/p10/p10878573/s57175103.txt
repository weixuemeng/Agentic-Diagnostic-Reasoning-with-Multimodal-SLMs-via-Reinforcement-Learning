                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with flash pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  A right IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  Left pacemaker remains in
 unchanged position with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle
 and left ventricle.  Enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. Stable
 mild cardiomegaly. Moderate pulmonary edema has significantly improved. Left
 lower lung is not well aerated which may represent atelectasis versus residual
 edema and probably overlying pleural fluid.  No large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Significant improvement of moderate pulmonary edema. 
 
 2. Atelectasis versus residual edema of the left lower lung with overlying
 pleural fluid.
