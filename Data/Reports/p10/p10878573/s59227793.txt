                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation and new central line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from today at 17:43.
 
 FINDINGS: A supine portable frontal chest radiograph was performed. 
 Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now 5.8 cm above the carina.  A new right
 internal jugular line terminates in the low SVC.  Enteric tube terminates
 within the stomach.  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged.
 
 There is persistent perihilar ground-glass opacities, consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  There is a possible left pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of support devices with unchanged moderate
 pulmonary edema.
