                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.  Evaluate tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable frontal chest radiograph was performed.  A endotracheal
 tube is 8 cm above the carina.  A left pectoral pacemaker/AICD is present.
 
 There are bilateral perihilar ground glass opacities, consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity may be a small left pleural effusion. 
 Fluid is seen within the minor fissure.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube within the thoracic cavity, although could safely be
 advanced 2 cm for better positioning.  
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema and a probable left pleural effusion.
