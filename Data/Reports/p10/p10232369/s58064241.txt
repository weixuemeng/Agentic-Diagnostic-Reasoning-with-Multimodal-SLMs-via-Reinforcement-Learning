                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post ventral hernia repair, now with
 tachycardia.  Concern for pulmonary embolus or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes bilaterally.  Linear and curvilinear densities in the right
 mid lung reflect mild atelectasis.  No acute pneumonia or pneumothorax. 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Normal pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild right mid lung atelectasis without evidence of acute pneumonia.
 Chest radiograph cannot exclude pulmonary embolism, so if clinical concern for
 pulmonary embolus remains, obtain CTA chest.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Obtain CTA chest for better evaluation of pulmonary
 embolism.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings and recommendations were communicated to Dr.
 ___ at 16:47.
