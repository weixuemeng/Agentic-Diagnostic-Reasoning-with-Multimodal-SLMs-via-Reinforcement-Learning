 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded and clear.  Minimal right infrahilar opacity
 is not correlated on the lateral radiograph and likely reflects summation of
 shadows.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 deformity of the left chest wall is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
