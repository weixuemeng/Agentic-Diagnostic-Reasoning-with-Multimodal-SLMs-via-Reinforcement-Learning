                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung bases are excluded from the field of view due to the
 patient's extreme agitation.  The heart size appears at least moderately
 enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The visualized lungs demonstrate
 no focal consolidation, and there is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion
 identified, though assessment for pleural effusion is limited.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with exclusion of the lung bases.  No gross acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality, but recommend repeat exam for further assessment
 of the lung bases.
