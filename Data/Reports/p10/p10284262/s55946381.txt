                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with right rib fractures and pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, several of the multiple
 right-sided rib fractures seen on CT are now evident.  There is increasing
 opacification at the right base most likely consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.  The left lung is relatively clear with probably some
 mild atelectatic changes at the base.
