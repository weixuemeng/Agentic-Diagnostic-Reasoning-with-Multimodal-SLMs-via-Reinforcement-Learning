                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with one month of dyspnea on exertion.  Rule out
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Extent of pulmonary hyperinflation suggests at least some emphysema.  The
 heart is normal size; hilar, pulmonary, and mediastinal vessels are not
 engorged and there is no edema or pleural effusion.  Aorta is heavily
 calcified and mildly enlarged but not focally aneurysmal.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.  As far
 as one can tell from conventional chest radiographs, the trachea and main
 bronchi are clear.
