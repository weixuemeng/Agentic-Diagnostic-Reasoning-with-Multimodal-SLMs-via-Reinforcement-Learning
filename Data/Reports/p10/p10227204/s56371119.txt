                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain.  Please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is a subtle opacity in the retrocardiac region seen only on the
 lateral view, which may be secondary to atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the retrocardiac region may be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
