 AP CHEST, 7:47, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a Port-A-Cath.  Assess line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiograph,
 compared to chest CTA, ___:
 
 Severe consolidation, with a component of volume loss in the left lower lobe,
 suggests post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia, accompanied by
 small-moderate left pleural effusion.  Right lung is hyperinflated, and
 oligemia reflects severe pulmonary emboli.  The heart is moderately enlarged,
 and mediastinal veins dilated.  Right supraclavicular central venous catheter
 is oriented obliquely toward the midline, but this is not concerning for
 malposition.  The tip is at the level of the low SVC.
