                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with previous CXR opacity  // assess for evidence
 of PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest x-rays from ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided left subclavian PICC line is present, tip over proximal/ mid SVC.
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is faint residual opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and at the
 left base.  However, much of the previously seen opacity has resolved.  No
 upper zone redistribution or other vascular plethora and no interstitial edema
 is identified.  There is minimal blunting of the right and question left
 costophrenic angles, consistent with with small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Considerable interval improvement in previously seen opacities.
 
 Minimal residual opacity at both lung bases and probable small bilateral
 effusions.
