 The right IJ central venous catheter has been retracted, but still enters the
 right atrium.  Mild pulmonary edema has resolved. Bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are magnified by the projection. A coiled pigtail catheter is partially imaged
 in the right hemiabdomen.
