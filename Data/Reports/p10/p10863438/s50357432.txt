                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD3 from robotic resection of bile duct and
 ___ now with fever 102.1.  // Pulmonary etiology of post-op fevers.    
 Pulmonary etiology of post-op fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 22:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 15 44 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are stable small bilateral effusions. Lungs are relatively well
 inflated. Linear opacity at the left base likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis. There is some crowding of the vasculature due to relatively low
 volumes but no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable. Overall, there is improved aeration at
 both lung bases.
