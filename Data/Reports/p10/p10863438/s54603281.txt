                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with RIJ CVL  // placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular central line terminates in the right atrium and
 should be retracted for more optimal positioning. Lung volumes are low.  There
 is abnormally widened appearance of the mediastinum which could reflect
 suboptimal imaging technique. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 Heart size is unchanged. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line terminates in the right atrium.
 Recommend retracting by 3 cm to be at the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Mediastinal widening, new from prior, may reflect portable technique.
 Recommend repeat with more optimal technique to resolve this finding.
 Alternatively, if there is concern for mediastinal hematoma CT is recommended.
