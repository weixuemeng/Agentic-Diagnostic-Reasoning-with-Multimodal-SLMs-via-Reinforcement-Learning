                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Positive PPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging.  Lungs are fully expanded and essentially clear.  Cardiac silhouette
 is mildly to moderately enlarged due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial
 effusion, although there is no evidence of elevated central venous pressure,
 which one would see in a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion. 
 Also there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement, edema, or pleural effusion. 
 There are no radiographic signs of lymph node enlargement, but there is mild
 indentation on both sides of the trachea above the clavicles could be due to
 an enlarged thyroid gland.  Clinical correlation is indicated.
 
 There are no findings to suggest active or latent tuberculosis.
