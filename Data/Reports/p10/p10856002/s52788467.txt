                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea.  Evidence of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___.  PET-CT of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is continued right hilar enlargement, compatible with known
 lymphadenopathy, as seen on prior PET-CT and CT chest.  Rounded opacity in the
 right mid lung correlates with a pleural lesion seen on prior CT.  Scarring in
 the right apical lung.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear without new focal
 consolidation or pleural effusions.  A left-sided ICD shows leads in unchanged
 position.  Scarring and volume loss in the left lung is grossly unchanged,
 likely postsurgical.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Multiple findings relating to known history
 of lung cancer, as seen on recent PET-CT and CT chest.
