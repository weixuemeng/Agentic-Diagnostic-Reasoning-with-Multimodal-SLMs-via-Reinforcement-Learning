 left chest wall with two leads visualized extending into the region of the
 right ventricle.  The heart is within normal limits of size.  The lungs are
 clear without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The imaged osseous structures are intact.  There is no free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or effusion.
