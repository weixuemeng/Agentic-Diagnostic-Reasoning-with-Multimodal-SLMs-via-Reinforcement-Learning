                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // any worsening infiltrates,
 effusion?      any worsening infiltrates, effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Continued progression of widespread pulmonary abnormality that previously had
 a more interstitial quality, but has always been worse in the right upper
 lobe.  The accompanying increase in caliber of the mediastinum due to greater
 vascular engorgement suggests that the interval progression may be due to
 deposition of pulmonary edema on what could have been pneumonia.
 
 Heart is top-normal size, slightly larger than before.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not large.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium, as before.
