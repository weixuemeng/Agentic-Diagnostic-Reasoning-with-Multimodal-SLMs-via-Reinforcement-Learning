                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, DKA, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable chest radiograph is obtained.  The image
 provided excludes the bilateral lung apices and the lateral right hemithorax
 which considerably limits evaluation.  The imaged portions of the lungs appear
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study given exclusion of the lung apices and right
 lateral hemithorax, though no definite signs of pneumonia.  Repeat study may
 be performed to fully assess.
