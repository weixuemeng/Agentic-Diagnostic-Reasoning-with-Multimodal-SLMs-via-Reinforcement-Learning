                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after vomiting x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An opacity is seen projecting over the lateral right upper hemithorax which
 may be external to the patient.  No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity projecting over the lateral right upper hemithorax, may be external to
 the patient, no priors for comparison.  Recommend correlation for external
 artifact at this location.  Can be confirmed with repeat with removal of any
 external artifact or oblique views.  No focal consolidation seen elsewhere.
