 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show interval removal
 of an endotracheal tube since the preceding radiograph.  Mild pulmonary edema
 is improved with decreased pulmonary vascular congestion since ___.  Low
 inspiratory lung volumes are unchanged.  Bibasilar opacification with air
 bronchograms may represent focal consolidation in the correct clinical context
 or atelectasis.  The right lung base is elevated by a subjacent subpulmonic
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Severe degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar pneumonia in the correct clinical context or, alternatively,
 atelectasis.
 2.  Improved mild pulmonary edema and decreased pulmonary vascular congestion
 from ___.
 3.  Small subpulmonic right pleural effusion.
