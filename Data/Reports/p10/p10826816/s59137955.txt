 INDICATION:  Encephalopathy, NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON: Comparison made to chest radiogrpah performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 Dobbhoff tube which is coiled within the oropharynx.  Unchanged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Prominence of the right hilum is of uncertain
 significance. Stable hazy pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary edema. 
 Unchanged bibasilar consolidations likely represent a combination of edema,
 atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube coiled in pharynx.  ___ communicated these
 findings to ___ at 13:30 on ___ via telephone.
