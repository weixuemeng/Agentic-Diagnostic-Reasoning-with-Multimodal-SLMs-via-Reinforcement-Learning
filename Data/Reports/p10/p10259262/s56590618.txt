                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of small cell carcinoma and
 persistent substernal chest pain for 10 days.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Lateral view shows a severe sternal
 pectus deformity, not an expected cause of chest pain.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes aside from heavily calcified aortic
 knob, and no pleural abnormality.  Thoracic spine is mildly scoliotic but
 vertebral body heights are well preserved.  Degenerative osteophytes are
 present at several levels, although disc space narrowing is not particularly
 severe.
