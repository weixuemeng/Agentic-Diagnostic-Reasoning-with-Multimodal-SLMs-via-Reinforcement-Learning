                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:15 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion and a left chest tube,
 now removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 2:57 p.m.:
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is slightly larger, increasing from the level
 of the third posterior interspace to the bottom of the fourth posterior rib,
 although some of the change could be due to difference in level of
 inspiration.  Moderate right pleural effusion is stable.  There may also have
 been an increase in volume of left pleural effusion which is difficult to
 assess because of a substantial increase in left basal atelectasis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is more severe and mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
