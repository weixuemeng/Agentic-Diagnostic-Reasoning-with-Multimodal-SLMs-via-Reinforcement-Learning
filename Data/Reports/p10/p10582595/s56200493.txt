                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall with rib fractures and
 pleural effusions, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show multiple
 left-sided rib fractures, which are not appreciably changed from preceding
 chest radiograph.  Dedicated rib views are recommended for further evaluation.
 A wedge compression fracture deformity at the mid thoracic spine is of unknown
 age.  The patient is notably scoliotic and kyphotic.  The irregularity of the
 right humeral head is unchanged from CT of ___ and likely related to prior
 trauma.  Small bilateral pleural effusions on the left greater than the right
 are increased from the preceding radiograph with associated atelectasis.  A
 persistent small left apical pneumothorax is decreased in size from ___. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is overall unchanged, but incompletely
 assessed at the left heart border.  The aortic knob and descending thoracic
 aorta are moderately calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are not appreciably changed.  Dedicated
 rib views are recommended for detailed evaluation.
 2.  Slightly increased small bilateral pleural effusions on the left greater
 than the right from ___. 
 3.  Decreased size of persistent small left apical pneumothorax
