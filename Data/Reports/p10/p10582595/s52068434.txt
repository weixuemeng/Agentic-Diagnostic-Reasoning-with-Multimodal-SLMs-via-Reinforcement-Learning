                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Adjustment of the left chest tube.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the
 same day earlier.
 
 The left chest tube appears to be re-adjusted with the tip being projecting
 superiorly as compared to the prior examination.  The widespread parenchymal
 consolidations and bilateral pleural effusion appear to be unchanged. There is
 evidence of left apical pneumothorax, small, better appreciated on the current
 radiograph as compared to prior examination.
