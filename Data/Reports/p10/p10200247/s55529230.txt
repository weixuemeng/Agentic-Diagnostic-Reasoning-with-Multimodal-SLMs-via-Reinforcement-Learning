                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known pulmonary fibrosis, worsening shortness of breath.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. 
 There is a new drain visible in the right upper quadrant.  The known fibrotic
 changes are of unchanged extent and severity, in light of the lower lung
 volumes.  No new parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.
