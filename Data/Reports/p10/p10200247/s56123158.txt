 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Stage IV sarcoid, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The entire lung shows excessive fibrotic changes that lead to severe
 decrease in lung volume.  The lung parenchyma shows no evidence of newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.  Size of the cardiac silhouette remains small,
 clips are seen projecting over the liver, reflecting the history of
 hepatocellular carcinoma.
