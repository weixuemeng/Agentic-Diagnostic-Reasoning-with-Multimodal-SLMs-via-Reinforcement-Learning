                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.  
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to prior radiographs from ___.
 
 There is extensive airspace opacity and increased density particularly of the
 right lung consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis.  However, there is more
 focal area of consolidation within the right upper lobe which may represent
 superimposed pneumonia.  There is some blunting of the CP angles bilaterally. 
 The left lung demonstrates a wedge-shaped area of increased interstitial
 density within the mid portion which is unchanged from the prior study.  A
 catheter device projecting over the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominent interstitial markings consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis,
 right side worse than left.  
 
 2.  More focal area of increased density within the right upper lobe, which is
 new and may represent a superimposed pneumonia.
