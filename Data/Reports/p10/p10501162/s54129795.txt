 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as more recent PET-CT
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky
 right basilar and left basilar opacities are most consistent with minor
 atelectasis.  There is similar mild relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.  Mild anterior wedging of a mid-to-upper thoracic
 vertebral body appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
