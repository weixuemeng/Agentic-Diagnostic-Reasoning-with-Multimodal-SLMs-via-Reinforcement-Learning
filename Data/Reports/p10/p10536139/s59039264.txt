                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abnormality on CXR 3 months ago, recheck
 to ensure stability/resolution  // recheck to ensure resolution/stability of
 abnormality on previous imaging     recheck to ensure resolution/stability of
 abnormality on pre
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The small opacity questioned as a possible lung lesion on the report of the ___ chest radiographs is barely visible today. However there is some
 asymmetry in comparing equivalent areas of the upper lobes, the intersection
 of the first anterior and third posterior interspaces. In order to exclude an
 abnormality with certainty I would recommend supplementing this study with
 extremely shallow oblique views, after marking any skin lesion in the region
 with a metal BB. Also, the patient should be radiographed disrobed to the
 waist, with her hair pulled out of the field of view. Those oblique views
 should be reviewed by a radiologist before the patient leaves the department.
 
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 11:08 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
