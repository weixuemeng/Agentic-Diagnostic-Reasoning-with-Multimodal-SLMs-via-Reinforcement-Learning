                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new-onset CHF.  Tachypneic and desatting to
 ___%.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval increase in moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and
 right lower lobe opacity with new right upper lobe heterogeneous opacity.
 Unchanged left apical pleural thickening and scarring. No interval change in
 the dense retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm which
 represents a Bochdalek hernia.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Heart
 size is partially obscured by the pleural parenchymal process.  Mediastinal
 contour and hila are normal.  No bony abnormality. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Interval increase in moderate-sized right pleural effusion. 
 2. Worsening right lower lobe opacity and new right upper lobe opacity are
 likely due to evolving pneumonia or aspiration.
