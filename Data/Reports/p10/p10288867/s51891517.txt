                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with colorectal cancer and diffuse metastasis,
 presents with tachycardia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest re-demonstrates a right pectoral
 dual-channel catheter with tip in the cavoatrial junction.  Cervical hardware
 related to fusion and posterior fixation appear unchanged.  Overall extent and
 distribution of multifocal rib-based metastases appear unchanged since end of
 ___.  
 
 Allowing for respiratory motion, there are subtle increased opacities
 involving the right lung base and left mid lung, new since ___,
 which could represent early evolving infection.  There is no pneumothorax,
 vascular congestion, or large effusion.  
 
 Assessment of osseous integrity is somewhat limited and should be correlated
 on cross-sectional imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to repiratory motion.  Allowing for such, there
 are bilateral infrahilar reticular opacities, new since ___,
 raising question of early evolving infection versus aspiration. Consider
 dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs once able.
