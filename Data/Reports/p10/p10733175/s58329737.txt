                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with left arm and neck pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear.  No confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion or overt edema is identified.  There is no pleural effusion.  On
 the frontal view only, there is a mild convexity at the level of the
 descending thoracic aorta near the diaphragmatic margin, findings suggestive
 of a small hiatal hernia.  The remainder of the cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta appears tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible small hiatal hernia.
