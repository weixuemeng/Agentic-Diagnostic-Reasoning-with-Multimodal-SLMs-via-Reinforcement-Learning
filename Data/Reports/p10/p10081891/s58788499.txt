                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall from standing.  Question
 fracture or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, particularly on the right.  Relative right hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation is noted.  Allowing for such, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax, confluent consolidation, or
 large effusion.  A 6-mm rounded density projecting over the left clavicle is
 consistent with a bone island upon correlation with a preceding CT cervical
 spine.  Trace linear atelectasis is present in the left base.  Mild multilevel
 thoracolumbar spondylosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No appreciable displaced osseous injury.
 3.  No definite evidence to suggest pneumonia.
