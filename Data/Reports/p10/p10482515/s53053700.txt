                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 otherwise are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal patchy
 opacity in the left lung base is nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis or
 infection.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle posteriorly on the
 lateral view may reflect a small pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy nonspecific opacity in left lung base could reflect an area of
 infection or atelectasis.  Probable minimal trace right pleural effusion.
