                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta.  No evidence of acute
 pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Sclerotic foci are again seen bilaterally,
 consistent with known metastatic disease.  This appears somewhat more
 prominent on the current study.
 
 Port-A-Cath extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
