                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with balloon, shock  // pls eval for interim
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:26 the IABP pump radiopaque
 tip may be very slightly lower, but remains overlying the upper portion of
 aortic knob
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The IABP pump radiopaque tip may be very slightly lower, but remains
 positioned high, overlying the upper portion of aortic knob.
 
 There remains CHF with vascular plethora, interstitial edema and bibasilar
 atelectasis, but the appearance is improved compared with the earlier film. 
 No gross effusion.
 
 Multiple tubes overlie the neck, but the ET tube making it difficult to
 visualize the ET tube.  ET tube tip appears to lie a 5 cm above the carina, at
 the lower edge of the clavicular heads.  The NG tube and sideport in the
 overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in CHF findings, though interstitial edema remains
 present.
 
 IABP radiopaque tip may be very slightly lower, but is still positioned high
 ,over the upper portion of the aortic knob.  Clinical correlation regarding
 retraction by approximately 2.7 mm is again recommended.  Please see previous
 report regarding notification.
 
 ET tube difficult to confidently visualize, but the tip appears to lie 5 cm
 above the carina.
