                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation  // pls eval ET tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip lies at the level of mid clavicular heads are
 of the carina.  An NG tube is present.  The tip extends beneath the diaphragm,
 off the film.
 
 An apparent intra-aortic balloon pump is present.  The radiopaque tip overlies
 the upper edge of the aortic arch -- clinical correlation regarding retraction
 by approximately 3 cm to lie in the proximal descending aorta is requested.
 
 Faint cylindrical density overlying the thoracic spine at the level of the
 aortic arch likely represents material outside the patient.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or minimally enlarged.
 
 Vascular plethora and diffusely increased interstitial markings is present. 
 This could represent CHF with interstitial edema, though a diffuse
 interstitial process could have a similar appearance.  There is subsegmental
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube 6.1 cm above the carina.
 
 Radiopaque tip of an intra-articular balloon pump overlies the upper edge of
 the aortic arch.  Clinical correlation regarding retraction into the proximal
 descending aorta by approximately 3 cm is requested.
 
 Diffusely increased interstitial markings and bibasilar atelectasis.  The
 appearance is compatible with CHF, though a diffuse interstitial process could
 have a similar appearance.  No gross effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Position of aortic balloon pump tip and recommendation for
 slight retraction was discussed by Dr. ___ with covering physician Dr ___
 ___, by telephone, at 9:14 am on ___, approximately ___ min after
 discovery.
