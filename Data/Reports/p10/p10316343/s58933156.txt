                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild
 prominence of interstitial opacities in the lower lungs bilaterally, greater
 on the left than right, and perhaps better demonstrated on the lateral than
 frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Reticulation and peribronchial cuffing which could be seen with lower airway
 inflammation or infection.  Atypical pneumonia should also be considered.
