                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.  AICD device
 is unchanged with tip extending into the expected location of the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips
 are again noted.  Diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacities are most likely
 secondary to pulmonary edema.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  A
 tiny left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  Cardiomegaly is
 stable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 cardiomegaly.
