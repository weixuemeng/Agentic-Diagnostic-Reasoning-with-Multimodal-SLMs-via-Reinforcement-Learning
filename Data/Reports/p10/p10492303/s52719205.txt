                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Outside hospital chest radiograph for asthma exacerbation,
 non-radiologist reported and hilar adenopathy and increased interstitial
 markings.  Please evaluate and compare.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.  No peribronchial cuffing identified to suggest
 asthma exacerbation.  There is mild asymmetric increased density within the
 right infrahilar region which may represent atelectasis versus early
 infectious process.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax evident.  Multilevel
 degenerative change detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: No lymphadenopathy. Patchy right lower lung opacification may
 represent early pneumonia.
