                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Diffuse
 predominantly subpleural fibrosis is re- demonstrated with superimposed
 increased interstitial abnormality, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema. 
 Additionally a more focal opacity in the left lower lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia and mild pulmonary edema superimposed
 upon severe pulmonary fibrosis.
