                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative with leukocytosis and bilateral crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in the diffuse prominence of interstitial markings consistent with
 severe bilateral pulmonary fibrosis.  No definite new parenchymal opacities to
 suggest pulmonary edema or pneumonia, though these would be difficult to
 assess on anything but clinical grounds, given the diffuse pulmonary changes.
