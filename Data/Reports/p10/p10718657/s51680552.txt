                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer. Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Posterior right lower lobe opacity again may relate to the
 patient's known diagnosis of lung cancer; however, aside from the prior
 radiograph from ___, no other studies or cross-sectional imaging is
 available for comparison.  Additional scarring/opacity is seen along the right
 mid-to-lower lateral chest, again overall similar to the prior exam.  Trace
 blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may be secondary to small
 bilateral pleural effusions, again similar to the prior exam.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  The heart shadow is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Again seen
 are partially imaged bilateral shoulder arthroplasties.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Again seen is a large right lower lobe opacity measuring up to 7.6 cm, likely
 corresponding to patient's known lung cancer.  Please correlate with prior
 cross-sectional imaging.
