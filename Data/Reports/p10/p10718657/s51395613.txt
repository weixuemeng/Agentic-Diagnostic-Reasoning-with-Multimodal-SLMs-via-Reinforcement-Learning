                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, altered mental status  // Eval for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains within normal limits. The aorta is tortuous. 
 Previously seen right lower lobe mass has substantially decreased in size from
 the previous exam with residual right infrahilar opacity likely reflective of
 post-treatment change and/or residual disease. There is no pulmonary edema.
 The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again demonstrated.
 Small right pleural effusion is noted with interval decrease in extent of
 lateral pleural thickening as seen on the prior study. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. Bilateral shoulder
 arthroplasties are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval decrease in size of right lower lobe mass with residual
 right infrahilar opacity likely reflective of post-treatment changes and/or
 residual disease. Small right pleural effusion. Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis but are nonspecific.
