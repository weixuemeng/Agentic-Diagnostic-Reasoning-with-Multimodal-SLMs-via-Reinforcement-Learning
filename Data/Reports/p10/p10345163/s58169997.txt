                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  No obvious pneumothorax.  The right-sided catheter
 is again seen overlying the distal  SVC.  The chest tubes and mediastinal tube
 have been removed.
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and of the vascular
 markings, at least in part accentuated by low lung volumes.  The possibility
 of background CHF cannot be excluded in this setting.  The patient has known
 pre-existing cardiomegaly.  Sternotomy wires noted.

 As above.
