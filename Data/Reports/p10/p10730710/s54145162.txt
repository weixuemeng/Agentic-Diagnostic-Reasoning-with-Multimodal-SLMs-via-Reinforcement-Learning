                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pain for two days after fall.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax or fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or rib fractures. 
 However, this study has limited sensitivity for the detection of rib
 fractures.  If there is further concern, dedicated rib views are recommended.
