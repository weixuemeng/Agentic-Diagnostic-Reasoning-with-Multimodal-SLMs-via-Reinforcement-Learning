                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post lung biopsy moderate pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT interventional procedure images ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A fiducial marker is present in the right upper lobe with a small
 amount of adjacent hemorrhage, which appears perhaps less extensive than on
 the recent intraprocedural CT scan.  A small right apical pneumothorax is not
 enlarged in size since the concurrent CT.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion.  Right chest port is
 present with tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax with a small amount of hemorrhage
 adjacent to a fiducial marker in the right upper lobe.
