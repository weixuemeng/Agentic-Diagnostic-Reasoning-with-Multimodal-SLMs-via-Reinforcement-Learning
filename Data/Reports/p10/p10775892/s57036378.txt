                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent small right apical pneumothorax is not appreciably
 changed compared to the previous post-biopsy radiograph of earlier the same
 date.  Again demonstrated is a single fiducial seed overlying a site of a
 known right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.  New poorly defined opacity
 surrounding the nodule compared to a preprocedural radiograph on ___ probably represents post-procedural hemorrhage.  This is slightly
 improved from the immediate post-biopsy radiograph.  Otherwise, no relevant
 short-interval changes since the previous study from a few hours earlier.
