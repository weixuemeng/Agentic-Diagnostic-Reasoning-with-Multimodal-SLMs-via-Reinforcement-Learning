                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with imbalance and frequent falls.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Increased AP diameter of the chest on the
 lateral view is similar to prior examination and is suggestive of underlying
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 confluent consolidation.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are
 identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No pneumonia. 
 No displaced fracture is seen, but if clinical concern for rib fracture is
 high, rib series or CT is more sensitive.
