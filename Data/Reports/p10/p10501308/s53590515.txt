                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest.  First film demonstrates a right
 mainstem bronchus intubation.  The second film demonstrates endotracheal tube
 tip within 1 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes are noted, and the lung
 bases are excluded from the field of view on the second film.  There is
 widening of the upper mediastinum likely due to low lung volume and supine
 technique.  Enteric tube passes off the inferior field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube within 1 cm from the carina.
