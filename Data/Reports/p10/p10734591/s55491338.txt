                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes and persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis but underlying
 consolidation from infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Slight blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle is again seen, possibly due to atelectasis or
 trace pleural effusion.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar opacities most likely due to
 atelectasis but consolidation from infection or aspiration not excluded.
