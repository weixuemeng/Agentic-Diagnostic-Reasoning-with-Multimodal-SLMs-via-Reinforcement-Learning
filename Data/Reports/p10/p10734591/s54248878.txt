 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fatigue, peripheral edema, low oxygen saturation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The vascular diameters of the hilar vessels are still at the upper
 range of normal.  In addition, a zone of slightly increased radiodensity is
 seen at the medial aspect of the right lung bases.  Likely, this change is
 atelectatic, but could be further evaluated by CT because of its chronicity.
 
 No other lung parenchymal changes.  2 mm calcified granuloma projecting over
 the lower aspects of the third left rib.  No pleural effusions.  No
 cardiomegaly.  No pneumonia.
