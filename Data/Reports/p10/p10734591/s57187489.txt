                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, likely accentuating the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  The hila are unremarkable. 
 Hazy opacity near the right cardiophrenic angle likely represents crowding of
 normal bronchovascular structures and/or atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Diffuse subjective osseous demineralization
 is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung base atelectasis in setting of low lung volumes.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process identified.  Stable chest radiograph.
