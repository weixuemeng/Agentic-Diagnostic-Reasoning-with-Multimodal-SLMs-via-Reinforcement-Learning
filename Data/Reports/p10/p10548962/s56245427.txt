                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of altered mental status.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___ as well
 as CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath which appears to terminate in the
 mid SVC, unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The lung volumes are low. 
 Increased linear opacities at the lung bases bilaterally are likely due to
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Low lung volumes with linear opacities at the lung bases bilaterally likely
 due to atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
