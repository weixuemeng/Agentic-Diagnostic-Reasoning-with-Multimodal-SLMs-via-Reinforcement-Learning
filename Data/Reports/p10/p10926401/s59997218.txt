                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and congestion  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Mild
 blunting of the costophrenic angles may represent trace pleural fluid versus
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits
 allowing for low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  No lobar consolidation.
