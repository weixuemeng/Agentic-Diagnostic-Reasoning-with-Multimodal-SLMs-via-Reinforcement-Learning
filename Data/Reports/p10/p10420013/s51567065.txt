                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pneumonia, large volume resuscitation  //
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  Patchy left base opacity is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Medial right base opacity is felt to more likely due to overlap of
 vascular structures or atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is mild central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 Patchy left base opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Medial right base opacity
 is felt more likely to be due to overlap of vascular structures or
 atelectasis.
