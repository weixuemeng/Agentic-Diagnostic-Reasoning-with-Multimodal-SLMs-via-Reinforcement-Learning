                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with septic shock, intubated, s/p massive fluid
 resuscitation.  // interval line check, pulmonary edema/congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is not well visualized, but likely in the mid
 thoracic trachea.  Esophageal temperature probe is seen in the low esophagus. 
 Enteric tube, right central venous catheter, and left subclavian line appear
 unchanged.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild pulmonary edema is not significantly changed. 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  No other consolidation.  Small
 layering left pleural effusion, unchanged.  No sizable pleural effusion on the
 right.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema and small layering left pleural effusion, unchanged.
 2. Tip of the endotracheal tube is not well visualized due to overlapping
 structures, but likely terminates near the mid thoracic trachea.  Esophageal
 temperature probe appears new and is appropriately positioned.  Otherwise
 stable positioning of other support lines and devices.
