 Right central venous line tip is at the level of mid to lower SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable.  Right lower lung consolidation appears to be
 unchanged since the prior study.
 
 There is new consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for aspiration or
 infectious process.  No appreciable pulmonary edema is present.

 subsequent studies is recommended to exclude the possibility of developing
 lung abscess.
