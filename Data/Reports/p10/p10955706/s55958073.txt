                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M PMHx obesity, COPD, dCHF (EF ___%), T2DM who was admitted
 on ___ with spinal stenosis and concern for early cauda equina and is now
 post-op day 7 from a L3-L5 laminectomy and L4-5 fusion with hospital course
 complicated by hypoxia ___ MSSA PNA, PE, and pulmonary edema requiring
 intubation and hypotension s/p levophed weaned to 3L NC and transferred to
 medicine for ongoing management  // Eval for interval change, lung
 consolidation Eval for interval change, lung consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the lung volumes have
 slightly improved.  Central catheter position is unchanged, as is the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 There is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Again there is suggestion of focal area of opacification
 at the left base that could represent a developing pneumonia.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is not well seen, suggesting possible pleural fluid and
 atelectasis.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia at the right base
 would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
