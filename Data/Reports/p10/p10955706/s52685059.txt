                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decubitus ulcer // ? pulmonary infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, outside CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is mild-to-moderate
 streaky bibasilar opacity.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Biapical
 bullae, left worse than right, were better evaluated on prior CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild-to-moderate bibasilar opacities are again seen.  This may well represent
 continued atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
