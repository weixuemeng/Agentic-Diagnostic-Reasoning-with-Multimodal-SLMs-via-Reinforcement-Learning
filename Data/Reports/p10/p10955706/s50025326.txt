                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 8.0 cm above the carina.  A right IJ catheter
 terminates at the lower SVC.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged from the prior examination.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion
 seen on the prior radiograph has improved.  There are persistent bibasilar
 linear opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Small underlying
 consolidations, particularly at the right base, remain possible.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
