                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p L3-L5 lami-fusion with progressive SOB and hypoxemia now
 s/p intubation  // interval cxr
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved but only partially aerated with
 residual bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is stable.  A small left
 pleural effusion is likely stable given differences in positioning.  Left
 apical bulla without pneumothorax.
 
 Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, unchanged.  An NG tube has been
 placed with distal tip in the stomach and side-port beyond the expected
 location of the gastroesophageal junction.  Lumbar fusion hardware is
 partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved left lower lobe atelectasis but are persistent consolidation is
 concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  The same is true for the smaller region
 can of consolidation in the right lung base medially.
 2. NG tube in appropriate position.
