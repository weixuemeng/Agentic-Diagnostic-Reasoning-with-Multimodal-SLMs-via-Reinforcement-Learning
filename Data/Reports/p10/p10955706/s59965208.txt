 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter is been removed. 
 There are slightly better lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits and there is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Right basilar opacification is less
 prominent, possibly related to the upright position, but still consistent with
 pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Dense streak of atelectasis is again seen at
 the left base.
