                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with edema, sepsis  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the size of
 the heart.  Hazy opacification of the right base with silhouetting
 hemidiaphragms suggests layering effusion with basilar atelectasis.  Poor
 definition of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
