                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M PMHx obesity, COPD, dCHF (EF ___%), T2DM who was admitted
 on ___ with spinal stenosis and concern for early cauda equina and is now
 post-op day 7 from a L3-L5 laminectomy and L4-5 fusion with hospital course
 complicated by hypoxia ___ MSSA PNA, PE, and pulmonary edema requiring
 intubation and hypotension s/p levophed weaned to 3L NC and transferred to
 medicine for ongoing management  // Eval for interval change Eval for interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes.  Central catheter again extends to the lower SVC. Cardio mediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, more prominent on the left,
 consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  More focal
 opacification is seen in the left lower zone.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this would be worrisome for aspiration or infectious process.
 Continued blunting of the costophrenic angles with basilar atelectasis.  The
 minor fissure appears sharply defined on the current study.
