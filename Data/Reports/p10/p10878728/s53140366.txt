                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left craniotomy and
 mass resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 7:29 p.m.
 
 A portable AP radiograph was reviewed.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 Lung volumes are slightly better than on the most recent prior study but with
 still present right lower lobe opacity most likely reflecting atelectasis but
 attention to this area to exclude developing infection is recommended.
