                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with subdural hemorrhage, evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable chest view was read in comparison with most
 recent radiograph from ___, performed 10 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is 3.9 cm above the carina and orogastric
 tube ends into the stomach, appropriately positioned.  There are no interval
 changes in the lungs since the prior radiograph acquired 10 hours apart. 
 Minimal opacity in the right lung base, probably atelectasis, is similar.  No
 new discrete or confluent opacities of concern.  Mildly enlarged heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Pleural effusions if any are small bilaterally and stable.
