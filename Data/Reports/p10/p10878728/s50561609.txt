                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4
 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube is noted which is coursing below the
 diaphragms, off the inferior borders of the film.  There are low lung volumes.
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Apparent widening of the superior
 mediastinum is likely due to supine technique and low lung volumes.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with a possible element of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Nasogastric tube courses below
 the diaphragm, with the tip not visualized, off the inferior borders of the
 film.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
