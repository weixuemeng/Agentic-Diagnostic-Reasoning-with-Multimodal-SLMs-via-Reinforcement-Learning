                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post removal of tracheostomy tube.  The subglottic and
 proximal tracheal air columns are not well visualized, possibly related to the
 known history of subglottic stenosis, with possible component of edema or
 granulation tissue following removal of the tracheostomy tube.  This would be
 more fully evaluated by dedicated airway CT.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  Lungs are clear except for linear left basilar
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited visualization of subglottic and proximal tracheal air columns as
 described above.
 
 2.  Linear left basilar atelectasis.
