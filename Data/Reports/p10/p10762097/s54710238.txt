                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Incarcerated hernia and bowel perforation.  Check NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subject to technical limitations in imaging a patient this size,
 NG tube can be traced only as far as the gastroesophageal junction.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have increased.  Soft tissue
 obscures the lower lungs.  There could be a small right pleural effusion.
