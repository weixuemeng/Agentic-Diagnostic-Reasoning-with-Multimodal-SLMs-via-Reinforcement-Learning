                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cough, fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The lungs demonstrate linear opacities at the left base likely
 representing subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. There are new patchy
 opacities over the left mid to lower lung, as well as the lateral left upper
 lung and left lung base, concerning for infection.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New patchy opacities in the left lung concerning for infection. If possible,
 lateral views would be helpful for further localization.
 
 No recent priors were available for comparison, so interval change of disease
 cannot be assessed.
