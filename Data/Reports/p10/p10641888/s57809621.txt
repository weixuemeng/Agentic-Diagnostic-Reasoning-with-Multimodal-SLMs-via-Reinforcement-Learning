                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Waldenstrom's
 globulinemia after fall with painful breathing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval development of linear atelectasis in the lingula.  There is
 small amount of pleural effusion on the left, similar to the amount of fluid
 seen on the prior CT torso.  Multiple rib fractures are better appreciated on
 the prior CT torso, but still can be seen on the chest radiograph involving
 fifth, sixth, seventh ribs posteriorly.  Right lung is essentially clear with
 no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable in appearance.
