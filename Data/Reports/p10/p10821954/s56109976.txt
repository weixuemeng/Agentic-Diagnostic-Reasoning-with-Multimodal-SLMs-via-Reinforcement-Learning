                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with atrial fibrillation, presenting
 with syncope, new fall at bedside, evaluate for pneumothorax or
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 semi-upright position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  There is
 marked cardiac enlargement seen involving the left heart.  Thoracic aorta is
 generally widened and elongated, but no local contour abnormalities are
 identified.  Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution
 pattern, but there is no evidence of advanced interstitial or central alveolar
 edema.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates are present.  The lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No
 conclusive evidence of any acute rib fracture or pneumothorax, but report on
 right-sided unilateral rib examination will be issued separately.
 
 Our records do not include a preceding chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac enlargement with evidence of mild degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No evidence of acute infiltrates and no pneumothorax
 identified.  No signs of acute pleural effusion or pulmonary infiltrates.
