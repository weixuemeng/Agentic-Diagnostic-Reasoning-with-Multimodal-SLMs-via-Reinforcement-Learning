                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia with worsening dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Lungs are low in volume. Lateral view shows scarring in one of the
 apices, probably the right. Hazy opacification over the right mid lung, worst
 laterally, is probably pleural thickening; a left anterior oblique view could
 confirm this is continuous with the pleural thickening visible along the
 lateral costal margin.  No pulmonary edema or focal consolidation is
 identified.  The heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
