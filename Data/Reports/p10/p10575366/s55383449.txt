                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic cough and postnasal drip.
 No fever or shortness of breath.  Questionable COPD.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is seen. 
 Thoracic aorta mildly elongated but otherwise unremarkable. No mediastinal
 abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Similar
 as described on previous examination rather irregular peripheral distribution
 and increased translucency is strongly suggestive for chronic obstructive
 airway disease and emphysema.  This is supported by the low positioned and
 flattened diaphragms.  With the exception of a focal density which most likely
 represents scar formation in the periphery of the lingula along the lower left
 cardiac border, there is no evidence of any major scar formation, interstitial
 changes or acute parenchymal infiltrates.  Thus, in comparison with the next
 preceding chest examination ___ ___, findings exclude cardiac
 enlargement, pulmonary vascular congestion and acute infiltrates.  The
 described general pulmonary changes are clearly compatible with COPD.
