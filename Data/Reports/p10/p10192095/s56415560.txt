                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with advanced small cell lung CA, now w/vertigo  //
 eval for pna, mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT performed ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large left hilar mass was better assessed on CT 1 day prior.  Peripheral left
 upper lobe 2 cm pulmonary nodule/ mass is re- demonstrated and also better
 assessed on pre seeding CT.  Additional pulmonary nodules are better assessed
 on CT.  Subtle reticular opacities bilaterally with a basal predominance are
 consistent with chronic interstitial lung disease.  Mild biapical pleural
 thickening is re- demonstrated.  There is likely a small left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left hilar mass and peripheral left upper lobe pulmonary nodule/mass
 seen on CT 1 day prior were better assessed on CT.  Chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  No new opacity identified.
