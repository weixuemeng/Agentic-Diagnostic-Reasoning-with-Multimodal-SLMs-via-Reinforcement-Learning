                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam, chest x-ray from ___, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis
 performed earlier the same day.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 likely due to a combination of atelectasis or scar and left cardiophrenic fat
 pad seen on CT.  Increased density projecting over the spine inferiorly is
 compatible with left basilar bronchiectasis and scarring identified on CT. 
 There is no new consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Median sternotomy wires are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
