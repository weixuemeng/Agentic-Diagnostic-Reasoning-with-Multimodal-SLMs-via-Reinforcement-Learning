 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is stable in size, but pulmonary vascular
 congestion is new, accompanied by perihilar haziness and minimal peripheral
 septal thickening.  Patchy and linear opacities have also developed at both
 lung bases, and there are small pleural effusions that have developed since
 the prior radiograph as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild interstitial edema, accompanied by small pleural effusions.
 2.  Patchy and linear dependent opacities, which may reflect atelectasis or
 aspiration.
