                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count and hypoxia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is patchy left infrahilar opacity with peribronchial cuffing. 
 Potentially, this may be at baseline but prior radiographs are not available
 for comparison.  The possibility of lower airway infection or even early or
 mild bronchopneumonia should be considered.  Slight scarring is present at
 each lung apex.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left infrahilar density, possibly associated with lower
 airway inflammation or infection, or potentially early or mild
 bronchopneumonia, but not of definite significance.
