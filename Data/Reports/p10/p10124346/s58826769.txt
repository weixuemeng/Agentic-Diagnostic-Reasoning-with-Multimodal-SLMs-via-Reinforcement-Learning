                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  However, given this, patchy left basilar opacity is
 seen and an infectious process is not excluded.  There is mild elevation of
 the anterior right hemidiaphragm.  Retrocardiac density, best seen on the
 lateral view, also seen on the prior study, may be due to a hiatal hernia.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Patchy opacity projecting over the lateral left lung base on the frontal view,
 not well substantiated on the lateral view, may be due to atelectasis versus
 infection.
