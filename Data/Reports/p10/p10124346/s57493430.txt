                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with chest pain, evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung
 volumes are low, but unchanged compared to the prior study.  Heart is not
 enlarged and cardiomediastinal contour is stable.  Bibasilar streaky opacities
 likely relate to pulmonary vascular crowding from low lung volumes. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is similar to the prior examination.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with accentuated bronchovascular markings. 
 Overall unchanged compared to the prior examination without evidence of acute
 intrathoracic abnormality.
