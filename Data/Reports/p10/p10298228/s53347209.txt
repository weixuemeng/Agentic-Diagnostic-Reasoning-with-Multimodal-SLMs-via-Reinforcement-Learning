 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly but pericardial
 effusion should also be considered.  Lungs are well inflated without evidence
 of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is
 an appropriate amount of aeration projecting in the retrosternal region on the
 lateral view.  If a retrosternal mass remains of clinical concern, further
 imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful.
