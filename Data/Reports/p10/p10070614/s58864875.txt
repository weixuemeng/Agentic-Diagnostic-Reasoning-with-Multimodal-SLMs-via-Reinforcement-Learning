                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Rapid atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS: None.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: There is minimal interstitial prominence including upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vascularity suggestin of pulmonary venous
 hypertension, but not to a striking extent.  Linear left basilar opacity
 appears unchanged and suggests minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary venous hypertension without frank
 congestive heart failure.  Patchy left basilar opacity suggesting minor
 atelectasis.
