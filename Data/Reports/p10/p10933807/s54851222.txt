 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with encephalopathy s/p reintubation  // Interval
 changes. ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over
 the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of an endotracheal tube projects at the
 level of the clavicular heads.  A feeding tube projects below the level the
 diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph and a second
 feeding tube tip projects over the gastric body.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Hazy opacities project over both lower lung
 zones, greater on the right, likely reflective of layering pleural effusions
 and subjacent atelectasis, greater on the right.  No pneumothorax identified.
 
 The size and appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects at the level of the clavicular heads
 and can be advanced by approximately 3 cm.
 
 Bilateral layering pleural effusions and subjacent atelectasis, greater on the
