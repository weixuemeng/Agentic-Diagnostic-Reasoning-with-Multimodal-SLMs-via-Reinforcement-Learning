  Densities projecting over the bilateral upper lungs could relate to the
  bilateral anterior first ribs, new since the prior study from ___.  Recommend shallow oblique radiographs or chest CT to exclude pulmonary
  lesions.
  
  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relate to atelectasis
  although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness, r/o infx  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Density is seen projecting over the bilateral upper chest, projecting over the
 region of the bilateral anterior first ribs, not seen on the prior study. 
 Well these findings may relate to the bilateral anterior first ribs, recommend
 shallow oblique radiographs or chest CT to exclude underlying pulmonary
 lesions.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacities most likely relate to atelectasis although consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Densities projecting over the bilateral upper lungs could relate to the
 bilateral anterior first ribs, new since the prior study from ___.  Recommend shallow oblique radiographs or chest CT to exclude pulmonary
 lesions.
 
 Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relate to atelectasis
 although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend shallow oblique radiographs or chest CT to
 exclude pulmonary lesions.
