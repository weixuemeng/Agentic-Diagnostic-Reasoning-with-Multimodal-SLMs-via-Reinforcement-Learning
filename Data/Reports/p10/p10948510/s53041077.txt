 // eval ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated coronary ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval decrease
 in size of the right-sided pleural effusion, which is now moderate in size. 
 Linear lucency along the right lateral lung had resolved on subsequent chest
 radiograph and likely represents a skin fold rather than a pneumothorax.
 Stable small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval decrease in size of the right-sided pleural effusion, which is
 now moderate in size.
 
 2.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
