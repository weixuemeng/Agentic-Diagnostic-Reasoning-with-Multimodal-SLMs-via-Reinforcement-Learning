                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  shortness of breath// eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:47 and chest CT ___ at 16:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate to large right pleural effusion layers on the current exam which
 accounts for the hazy opacity overlying the right upper and mid lung fields. 
 Small left pleural effusion is relatively unchanged. Assessment of the cardiac
 silhouette size is difficult given the presence of bilateral pleural
 effusions. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. No pulmonary edema is visualized.
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change compared to the previous studies from earlier
 today. Moderate to large layering right pleural effusion and small left
 pleural effusion with compressive bibasilar atelectasis.
