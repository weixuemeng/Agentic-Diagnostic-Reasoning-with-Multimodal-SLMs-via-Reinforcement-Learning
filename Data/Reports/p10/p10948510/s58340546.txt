 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Following recent thoracentesis, a large right hydropneumothorax has developed.
 Due to markedly leftward patient rotation, it is difficult to assess for
 possible signs of tension.  Moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly
 smaller fall thoracentesis.  Otherwise no relevant change in the appearance of
 the chest since the recent study.
