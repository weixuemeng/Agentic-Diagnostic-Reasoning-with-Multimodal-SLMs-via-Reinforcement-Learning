                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke and dysphagia, for Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a Dobbhoff tube
 in place with the metallic tip just beyond the esophagogastric junction. 
 Relatively low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild
 atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
