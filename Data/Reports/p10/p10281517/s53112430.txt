                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Calcification is noted along the
 aortic arch.  Bilaterally, calcified pleural plaques suggest prior asbestos
 exposure.  Plaques obscure visualization of parenchymal detail to some extent,
 but there is no convincing evidence for parenchymal abnormality.  Slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle may indicate a trace pleural
 effusion.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the left.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  Each acromioclavicular joint shows moderate
 degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Calcified pleural plaques, usually associated with prior asbestos
 exposure.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
