                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated,
 especially in descending portion.  There is new consolidation in the left
 lower lung, most likely within the lingula that might reflect interval
 development of new infectious process.  There is also new opacity in the left
 upper lung that might reflect infectious process as well.  Right lung is clear
 and hyperinflation is redemonstrated as well as substantial degenerative
 changes in the right humerus.
 
 Reassessment of the patient with chest radiograph four weeks after completion
 of antibiotic treatment is recommended.
