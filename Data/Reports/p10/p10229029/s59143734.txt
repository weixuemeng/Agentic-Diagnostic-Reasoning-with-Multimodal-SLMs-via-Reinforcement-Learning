                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with increased shortness of breath,
 known COPD, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiac
 enlargement with a left ventricular contour prominence.  The thoracic aorta is
 moderately widened and markedly elongated with some calcium deposits in the
 wall, but no signs of any local contour abnormality.  Within the heart shadow,
 the typical semi-lunar calcification in the mitral valve area indicative of
 annulus calcification.  No evidence of new acute discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates are seen that would suggest a pneumonia.  On the other
 hand, there is now a mild degree of blunting of the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses as well as a more accentuated density of the major interlobar
 fissures suggestive of some mild degree of chronic pulmonary congestion.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.  Skeletal structures are
 unchanged and include an accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine
 with increased depth diameter of the chest, but no conclusive evidence of any
 vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase of cardiac enlargement, increased prominence of the
 left ventricular contour, now development of some small amounts of pleural
 wetness in the bases, the absence of any detectable acute pulmonary pneumonic
 infiltrate.  The patient's cardiac condition could probably be enhanced by
 dehydration measures.
