                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sarcoid, presents with a week of cough, new
 shortness of breath today with pain in her back
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Moderate size hiatal hernia is re-
 demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Streaky opacity in
 the right lower lobe is again noted and could reflect an area of recurrent
 aspiration. Previously noted right upper lobe pneumonia has essentially
 resolved. No additional focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar streaky opacity may reflect recurrent aspiration, but
 atelectasis is also possible.
