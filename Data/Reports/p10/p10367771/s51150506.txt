                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP semi-upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was obtained. 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Patchy right basilar, possibly right
 middle lobe opacity is seen, raising concern for underlying pneumonia possibly
 due to infection or aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable and unremarkable.  Previously seen right-sided PICC is no longer seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial right basilar opacity, possibly right middle lobe
 raising concern for infection or possibly aspiration.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
 
 COPD.
