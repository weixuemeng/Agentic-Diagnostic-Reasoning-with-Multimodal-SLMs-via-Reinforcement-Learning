                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post unwitnessed fall, unconscious, intubated for airway
 management.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the thoracic inlet, approximately 7.2 cm
 from the carina.  Orogastric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm,
 into the stomach, off the inferior borders of the film.  The heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Focal ill-defined opacity within the right
 lung base may represent a area of infection or aspiration.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Scarring within the lung apices is noted
 with paraseptal emphysematous changes.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.  Left ___ and 4th rib fractures appear remote.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2. Focal opacity in the right lung base could reflect infection or aspiration.
