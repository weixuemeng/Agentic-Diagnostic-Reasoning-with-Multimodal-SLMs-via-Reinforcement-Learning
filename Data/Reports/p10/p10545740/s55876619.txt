  Low lung volumes.  Small left-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular
  engorgement.  Compared to prior examination, there has been increase in
  retrocardiac opacity with suggestion of some air bronchograms.  There is also
  increased density in the right lower lung.  This may represent either
  atelectasis or pneumonia given the appropriate clinical circumstance.  If
  amenable, a dedicated PA and lateral may be helpful for characterization.

 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sickle cell disease presents with chest
 pain and desaturation  // interval pulmonary changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is a new, small left
 pleural effusion new antenatal retrocardiac consolidation with air
 bronchograms.  Lung volumes remain low.  Engorgement of the pulmonary
 vasculature is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac consolidation and small, left pleural effusion is concerning
 for a developing left lower lobe pneumonia.
