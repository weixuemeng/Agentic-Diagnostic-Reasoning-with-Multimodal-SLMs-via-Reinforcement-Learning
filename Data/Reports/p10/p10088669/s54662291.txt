                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  History: ___F with ___ edema  // ? chf      ? chf
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The upper lobe pulmonary veins are full, as before.  There is interval
 blunting of the costophrenic angles.  There is minimal hazy density at the
 left base only well seen on the PA view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 heart is at the upper limit of normal in size.  The aorta is calcified. 
 Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable.  The bony thorax is grossly
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Development of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Continued evidence of mild
 pulmonary venous hypertension.  Ill-defined increased density at the left base
 may be due to pleural fluid.  A small area of focal consolidation cannot
 definitely be excluded.
