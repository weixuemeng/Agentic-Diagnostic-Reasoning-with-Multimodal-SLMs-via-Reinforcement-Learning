                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shock and s/p intubation  // Eval for
 interval change      Eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, scatter radiation related to the
 size of the patient again greatly obscures detail.  The endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes remain satisfactorily position.  Low lung volumes
 accentuates the substantial cardiomegaly with continued pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe, and there are probably small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
