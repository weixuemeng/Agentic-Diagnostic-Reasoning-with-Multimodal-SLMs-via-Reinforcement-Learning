 consolidation on CT, on vanc and cef, still spiking fevers // eval worsening
 PNA, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects towards the right mainstem bronchus

 noted.  Left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis have increased
 since the prior study.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia has worsened since the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low position of the endotracheal tube warrants retraction.
 2. Persistent kinking of the right internal jugular sheath.
 3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with moderate left
 lower lobe atelectasis.
 4. Right lower lobe pneumonia worsened since the prior radiograph.
