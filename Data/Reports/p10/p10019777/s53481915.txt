                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hematemesis status post ERCP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip terminating
 approximately 2.2 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube is noted with tip coursing
 below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach with tip off the inferior
 borders of the film.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is
 mild upper zone vascular redistribution with crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, likely related to supine AP positioning and low lung volumes. 
 Patchy opacities in the right mid lung field and right lung base may reflect
 areas of aspiration and/or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or large
 pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube is low lying, turning approximately 2.2 cm from the
 carina, and can be withdrawn by 1 cm for optimal positioning.
 2. Enteric tube in standard position.
 3. Low lung volumes with patchy right mid and lower lung field opacities,
 possibly due to aspiration and/or atelectasis.
