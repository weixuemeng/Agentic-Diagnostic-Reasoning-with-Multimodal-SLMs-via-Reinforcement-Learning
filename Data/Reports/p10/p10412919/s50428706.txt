                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia and hypotensive, status post central line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:17.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  Again
 seen are perihilar opacity that appears slightly increased as compared to the
 prior study, which may be due to worsening pulmonary edema.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is more prominent, query
 subpulmonic effusion or ascites.  There is left base opacity concerning for
 pleural effusion with atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Status post interval right IJ placement with catheter terminating in the
 mid-to-low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Pulmonary edema, which appears slightly increased.
 3.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, could be due to underlying
 subpulmonic effusion or ascites.
 4.  Left base opacity again seen due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
