                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with trauma, evaluate for pneumothorax, rib
 fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current
 radiograph.  Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable. 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Asymmetrically increased
 hazy opacity of the left hemi thorax relates to overlying soft tissue.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of a displaced
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture. 
 Note, chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of subtle or
 nondisplaced rib fractures.
