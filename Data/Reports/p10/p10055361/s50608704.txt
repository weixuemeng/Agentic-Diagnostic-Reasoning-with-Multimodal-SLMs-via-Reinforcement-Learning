                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with PICC, evaluate for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette including moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  An
 ICD device is also unchanged in position.  Interval development of increased
 opacification in the right lower lung probably reflects asymmetric edema and a
 layering effusion. The left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Previously noted pulmonary artery catheter has been removed.  There is
 interval placement of a right-sided PICC with tip terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right lower lung opacification probably relates to interval
 development of asymmetric edema and a layering right effusion, less likely
 pneumonia. Consider PA and lateral radiographs for confirmation.
 
 2.  Interval placement of a right-sided PICC with tip in the mid SVC.
