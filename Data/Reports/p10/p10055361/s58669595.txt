                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, HLD, and
 cirrhosis who presents with volume overload and generalized malaise. // asses
 pna, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Send upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. Left chest wall
 defibrillator lead terminates in the right ventricle. Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. Right lower lung
 opacity is stable to minimally less prominent. Apparent opacity projecting
 over the costophrenic sulcus on the lateral radiograph is not confirmed on the
 frontal projection and may be artifactual.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe opacity is somewhat less prominent possibly reflecting
 redistribution of pulmonary edema or clearing of pneumonia.
 2. Apparent opacity projecting over the costophrenic sulcus on the lateral
 radiograph is not confirmed on the frontal projection and may be artifactual
 or reflect pleural effusion. Consider repeat radiographs for confirmation if
 clinically indicate.
