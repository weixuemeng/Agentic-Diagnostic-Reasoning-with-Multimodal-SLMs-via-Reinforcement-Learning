                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, new pulmonary artery catheter, assess Swan placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There is cardiomegaly.  A pacemaker is present with the lead overlying the
 right ventricle.  An apparent Swan-Ganz catheter is present, with tip
 overlying the distal right pulmonary artery.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, with mild vascular plethora, but no overt CHF.  No focal
 infiltrate is detected.  Possible trace fluid at the left costophrenic angle.
 
 S-G catheter tip overlies distal right pulmonary artery -- clinical
 correlation requested regarding possible retraction.
