                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left lower lobe
 lobectomy with pneumothorax after removal of pigtail catheter.
 
 As compared to prior study from ___ obtained at 10:50 a.m., there
 is no interval increase in left apical pneumothorax after removal of the chest
 tube with even potentially slight additional decrease is demonstrated.  Left
 pleural effusion and left basilar opacity are unchanged.  Apical lucency on
 the right is unchanged, consistent with   bullous emphysema that has been
 demonstrated in this location on multiple prior examinations.
