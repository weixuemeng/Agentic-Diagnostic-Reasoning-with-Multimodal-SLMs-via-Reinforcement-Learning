 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pneumothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:41 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of an apical left pneumothorax, although the pneumothorax is now partially
 filled with fluid and at least two air bubbles are visible within the left
 apical opacity.  The left pleural effusion at the lung bases as well as some
 mild atelectasis has decreased in extent.  There is no evidence of tension. 
 No pathological changes of the heart and of the right lung.
