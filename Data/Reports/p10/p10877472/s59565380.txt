                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right lower lobe lobectomy with persistent air leak, CT
 to waterseal this morning, no pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:38 a.m., the relatively large left pneumothorax
 is again seen. There is a large component at the left lung apex, where the
 pigtail of the left lung catheter is seen.  There is an additional prominent
 component at the left lung base.  On today's exam, the fluid level of the
 small-to-moderate left basilar hydropneumothorax meniscus is more distinctly
 visible.  There is also a large component of the pneumothorax in the
 retrosternal region, best seen on the lateral view.  
 
 Of note, there are some increased interstitial markings in the partially
 collapsed inferior left lung, with sparing of the upper and mid zone
 parenchyma.  
 
 The right lung and right costophrenic sulcus are grossly clear.  Lucency at
 the right lung apex is noted, but is not suggestive of a pneumothorax.   The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline and is not enlarged.  Lucency
 over the left portion of the cardiac silhouette may be an artifact of
 pneumothorax, but raises the question of a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Large left-sided pneumothorax.  Although the overall extent is similar to
 the prior study, a hydropneumothorax fluid-level at the left lung base is
 newly visible. A pigtail catheter overlies left lung apex posteriorly. 
 
 2) Increased interstitial markings in the partially collapsed lower left lung
 again seen, unchanged.  While this could be due to atelectasis, it is
 concerning for a focal interstitial infiltrate.
