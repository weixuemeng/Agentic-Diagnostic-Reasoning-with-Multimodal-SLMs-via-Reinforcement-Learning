                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 9:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ataxia and vertigo and increasing white
 count, left lung nodule, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at
 21:42.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 9:22 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  With the exception of the nodular opacity in the left lower lung, the
 lungs are clear without evidence of airspace consolidation, pleural effusions,
 or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac contours are stable. 
 In the absence of more remote chest films to document stability of the opacity
 in the left lower lobe, further imaging evaluation with a dedicated CT scan
 should be considered.
