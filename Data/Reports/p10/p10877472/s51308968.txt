                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post left lower lobe resection.  A moderate left
 hydropneumothorax has slightly decreased in size from the prior study.  The
 apical pneumothorax component is now located between the fourth and fifth
 posterior ribs and was previously at the fifth posterior rib level.  A
 substantial hydropneumothorax component in the lower left hemithorax on the
 prior study demonstrates increase in amount of fluid and decrease in amount of
 gas compared to the prior exam.  Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place,
 terminating at the left apex.  Right lung is hyperexpanded and demonstrates
 some bullous emphysema at the right lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left hydropneumothorax, with slight decrease in size of
 apical pneumothorax component, and increased ratio of pleural fluid to pleural
 gas in the hydropneumothorax component in the lower left hemithorax. 
 Improving opacities in the lingula may reflect resolving reexpansion pulmonary
 edema and less likely pulmonary infection.
