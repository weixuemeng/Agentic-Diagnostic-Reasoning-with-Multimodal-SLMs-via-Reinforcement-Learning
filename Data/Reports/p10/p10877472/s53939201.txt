                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post robotic-assisted VATS left lower lobectomy and
 regional lymphadenopathy, ___, for non-small cell lung cancer. 
 Dry cough on speaking since surgery.  Small left hydropneumothorax in ___. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated same day three hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pneumothorax is again
 slightly increased in size.  The newly developed small left pleural effusion
 is stable in size.  Stable left lower lung opacifications.  Apparent rightward
 shift of the heart is likely due to patient rotation.  No evidence of tension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of left hydropneumothorax.  No evidence
 of tension.
