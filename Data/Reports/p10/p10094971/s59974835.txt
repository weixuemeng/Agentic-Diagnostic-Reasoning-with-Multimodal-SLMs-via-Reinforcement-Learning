                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion for 2 days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Calcified pleural plaques are noted bilaterally and obscures the
 assessment of the underlying lung parenchyma. Mild interstitial abnormality
 within the lung bases is similar. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is clearly noted.  Rounded calcified structure projecting over
 the medial aspect of the right lung apex is likely vascular in etiology and
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified, and there are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques limit assessment of the underlying lung
 parenchyma, but no new focal consolidation is seen. Chronic mild interstitial
 abnormality could reflect asbestosis and is unchanged.
