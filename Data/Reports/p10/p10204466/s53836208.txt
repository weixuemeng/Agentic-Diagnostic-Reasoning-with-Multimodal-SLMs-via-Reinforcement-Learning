                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a subtle
 opacity at the right lung base, which could represent atelectasis or a very
 early pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very subtle opacity in the right lung base, which overlaps with
 the underlying rib and could represent atelectasis, pneumonia is also possible
 in the right clinical setting.
