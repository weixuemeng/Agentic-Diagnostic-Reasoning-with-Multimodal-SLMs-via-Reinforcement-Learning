                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is vague low of posterior basilar
 opacity, present before, probably due to atelectasis, although somewhat more
 prominent.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Somewhat more prominent posterior basilar opacity but probably due to
 atelectasis or scarring.  It may be appropriate, however, to repeat
 radiographs in follow-up in order to ensure resolution although pneumonia is
 doubtful.
