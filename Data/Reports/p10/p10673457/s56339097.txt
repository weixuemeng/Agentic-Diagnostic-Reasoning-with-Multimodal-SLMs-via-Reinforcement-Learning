 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette appears slightly increased in size
 compared to the prior study, and may reflect enlarging pericardial effusion
 given history of this diagnosis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Previously present small right pleural effusion has decreased in size or
 resolved in the interval.  Lungs are clear except for minor atelectasis at the
 right base.
