 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with worsening dyspnea in the past 2 weeks with new 3L o2
 requirement  // ___F with worsening dyspnea in the past 2 weeks with new 3L o2
 requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increase in interstitial markings bilaterally concerning for
 underlying interstitial edema.  More focal opacity in the left mid lung is
 seen which could relate to fluid overload, but infectious process is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 There is severe compression of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction,
 best seen on the lateral view, also present on lumbar spine radiographs from
