 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:57 PM
  Interval extubation. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists.
  Interval development of multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities with
  peribronchial cuffing. Given the short time of development, edema is most
  likely. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage and infection. Underlying
  emphysema may be contributing to the patchy rather than diffuse distribution
  of this process. Repeat chest radiograph after diuresis is recommended.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:50 p.m. on ___ at time of
  discovery of these findings in response to wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Extubation this morning, worsening respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.  Interval
 development of multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities with moderate
 peribronchial cuffing, given the short time of development, pulmonary edema is
 most likely.  Differential diagnosis includes infection and hemorrhage. 
 Underlying emphysema may be contributing to the inhomogeneous distribution of
 the disease.  A repeat chest radiograph after diuresis is recommended.  
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.
