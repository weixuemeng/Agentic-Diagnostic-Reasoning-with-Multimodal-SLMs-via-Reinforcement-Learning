                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:23.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe mitral stenosis and AFib, now
 with hypotension, question acute finding.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 6:20 a.m.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 14:23 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the SVC is unchanged. 
 Heart remains moderately enlarged.  There continues to be airspace and
 interstitial process throughout both lungs but more focally involving the left
 upper and mid lung and both lung bases.  These findings could represent
 moderate pulmonary edema, less likely an infectious process.  There is likely
 a layering left effusion.  Overall, given differences in positioning and
 technique, there is likely no significant interval change.  No pneumothorax.
