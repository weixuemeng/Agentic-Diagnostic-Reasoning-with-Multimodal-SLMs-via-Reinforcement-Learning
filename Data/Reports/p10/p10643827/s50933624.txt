 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post MVR and chest tube removal, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tubes and
 mediastinal drains have been removed.  The pre-existing and known
 pneumothoraces have bilaterally increased in size, they are now approximately
 1-1.5 cm in diameter.  In addition, an area of atelectasis has newly appeared
 at the right lung bases.  The pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is
 unchanged in extent and severity.  Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the lung
 parenchyma and the cardiac silhouette.  The right internal jugular vein
 catheter remains in place.
