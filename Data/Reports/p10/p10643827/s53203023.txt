                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.  Evaluate for congestive
 heart failure versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated, limiting assessment of the lung fields. 
 Allowing for these limitations:
 
 An endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube has its side port
 in the stomach and the tip is out of view.  The lungs are hyperinflated. 
 There are bilateral interstitial opacities, with a reticular pattern and
 obscuration both the right and left heart borders.  Kerley B lines can be
 observed as well as vascular cephalization.  A left hilar opacity is noted. 
 There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size cannot be assessed due to limitations in positioning and AP
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Acute pulmonary edema.
 2.  Left hilar mass of unclear etiology might represent hilar prominence, but
 a focal consolidation cannot be excluded.  Further assessment with a
 post-diuresis chest radiograph is recommended and if there is persistence of
 this abnormality a chest CT is recommended for thorough characterization.
 3.  Endotracheal tube 2 cm above the carina and NG tube with side port in the
 stomach.
