                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  A right IJ central
 venous catheter is seen with its tip in the low SVC.  There are small apical
 bilateral pneumothoraces again noted without significant overall change in
 size compared with prior exam.  There are lower lung subsegmental bands of
 atelectasis which appears similar to prior exam allowing for slight
 differences in technique.  No effusion is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small persistent bilateral pneumothoraces with lower lung
 subsegmental atelectasis.
