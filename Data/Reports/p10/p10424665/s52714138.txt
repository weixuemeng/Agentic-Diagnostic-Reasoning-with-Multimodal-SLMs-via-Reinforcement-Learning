  Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes. However, the tip of the right
  IJ CVC still projects inferior to the carina. As a result, a repeat radiograph
  with improved inspiration is recommended to  evaluate whether the catheter tip
  is in the proximal right atrium or in the superior cavoatrial junction. No
  change otherwise from prior radiograph on the same day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Status post transplant, check position of right internal jugular
 vein catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:40 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been pulled back by approximately 2 cm.  The tip of the line
 now projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium.  There is no evidence
 of complications.  Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.
