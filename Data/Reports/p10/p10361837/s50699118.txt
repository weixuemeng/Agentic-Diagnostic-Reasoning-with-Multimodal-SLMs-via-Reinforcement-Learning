                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with SOB  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are increased interstitial markings with more confluent regions of
 consolidation in the right lung.  There is no effusion.  Imaging findings are
 grossly unchanged given differences in technique compared to exams from 1
 month prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median sternotomy wires
 are intact.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral parenchymal opacities, more extensive on the right than
 on the left.  Findings may represent a combination of asymmetric edema with
 possibility of superimposed infection.  Overall, appearance is not
 significantly changed since last month's exam.
