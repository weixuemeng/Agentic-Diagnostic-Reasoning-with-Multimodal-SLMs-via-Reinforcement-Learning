                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with extensive vascular history, woke up with left
 arm numbness/tingling, now resolved.  // any evidence of acute intracranial
 process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Right lung volume loss in
 the prior study has improved, although the volume of the right lung remains
 less than that of the left.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally
 suggests mild to moderate pulmonary edema, asymmetric, worse on the right, a
 in size or atypical infection given patient's history of HIV.  More
 opacification at the medial right lung base has been present over multiple
 prior studies and may represent combination of epicardial fat pad an
 infection/fluid overload.  A small right pleural effusion is seen.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mild to moderately enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, more so on the right, which could
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or atypical infection, given patient's
 history of HIV.  More focal opacity at the right lung base could relate to
 right epicardial fat pad and fluid overload versus infection.
 
 Small right pleural effusion.
