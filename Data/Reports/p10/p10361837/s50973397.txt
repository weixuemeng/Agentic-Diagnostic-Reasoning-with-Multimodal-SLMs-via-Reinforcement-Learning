 HTN/DM, HIV, ESRD s/p Kidney SCD ___Kidney SCD ___, recent

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  There are bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with
 alveolar and interstitial opacities, that could well represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  However, this appears low much less prominent today on the
 left, raising the possibility of superimposed pneumonia on the right.
 On the lateral views, there does not appear to be substantial pleural
 effusion.
