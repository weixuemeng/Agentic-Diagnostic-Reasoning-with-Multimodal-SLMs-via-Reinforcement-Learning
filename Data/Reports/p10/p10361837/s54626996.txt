                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea, crackles bilaterally on exam  // eval for
 pulmonary edema, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Confluent opacity seen in the right lung abutting the cardiac margin on the
 frontal view.  Additional consolidation seen overlying the spine on the
 lateral view.  Elsewhere, indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen
 bilaterally.  Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle suggests small
 associated effusion vs pleural thickening/scarring.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities per
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema with more confluent opacity in the right lung worrisome for
 superimposed infection although asymmetric edema would also be possible.
