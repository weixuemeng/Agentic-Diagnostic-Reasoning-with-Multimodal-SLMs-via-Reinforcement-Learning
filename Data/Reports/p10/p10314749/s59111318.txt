                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of post-operative day 6,
 presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen, likely terminating in the cavoatrial junction/right
 atrium, distal tip not well seen.  There are low lung volumes and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to
 a trace right pleural effusion.  A trace left pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.  Gastric air-fluid level is seen.  Partially imaged is
 air-distended bowel in the upper abdomen, not fully evaluated.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
