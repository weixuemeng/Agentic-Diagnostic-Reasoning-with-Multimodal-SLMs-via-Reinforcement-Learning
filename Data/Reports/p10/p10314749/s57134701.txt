                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left porta catheter remains in place, with tip terminating in the
 lower superior vena cava.  The heart size remains normal.  Improvement in
 right basilar atelectasis with residual linear atelectasis and volume loss
 remaining, but a new linear atelectasis has developed at the left lung base. 
 No focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia, and
 minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, but no areas of consolidation to suggest
 an acute pneumonia.
