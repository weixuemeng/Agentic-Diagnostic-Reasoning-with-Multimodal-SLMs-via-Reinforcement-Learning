                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has undergone
 left superior segmentectomy and lingulectomy and has a chest tube in place. 
 No convincing evidence of pneumothorax, though there is subcutaneous gas along
 the lateral chest wall extending into the neck.
 
 Very low lung volumes may account for the prominence of the pulmonary vessels,
 though some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure should be considered. 
 Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.
