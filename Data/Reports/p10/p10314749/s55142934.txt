                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left VATS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed.  A small residual apical pneumothorax persists.  Some subcutaneous
 gas is seen along the left lateral upper abdomen wall.  Dilatation of the
 gas-filled stomach is again seen, for which a nasogastric tube could prove
 helpful.  Opacification at the left base most likely represents a small
 effusion and atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
