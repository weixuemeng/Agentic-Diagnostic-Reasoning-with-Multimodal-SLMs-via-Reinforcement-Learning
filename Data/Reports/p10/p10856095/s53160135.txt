 aspiration pna/ pna     pls eval for aspiration pna/ pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends to the
 distal stomach. Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Areas of opacification at the right base
 have decreased, now with a pattern that suggests pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis. Mild blunting of the costophrenic angle is seen on
 the left.
 No definite focal consolidation, though basilar pneumonia on the right could
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
