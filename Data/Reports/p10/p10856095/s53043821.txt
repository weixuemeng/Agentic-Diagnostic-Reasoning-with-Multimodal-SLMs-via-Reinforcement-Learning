 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB and cough  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis are again seen, but appear
 somewhat increased since the prior study. The right aspect of the cardiac
 silhouette is not well assessed due to overlying opacity, but the cardiac
 silhouette is likely top-normal but possibly mildly enlarged. Mediastinal
 contours are grossly stable. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis appear somewhat increased as
 compared to the prior study. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
