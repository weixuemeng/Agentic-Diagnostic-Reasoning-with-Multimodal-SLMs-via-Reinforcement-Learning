                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph frontal and lateral views.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath. Assess for pneumonia or
 cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, though the diaphragms are not flattened. The
 heart is not enlarged. Blunting of the right heart border seen only on frontal
 radiograph likely reflects a mediastinal fat pad.  The patient's known
 mediastinal mass, seen on multiple prior CT scans, is not well delineated
 radiographically. The aorta is mildly unfolded. There is minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis and/or scarring. No frank consolidation or gross effusion
 identified. Possible trace right pleural effusion.
 
 Small calcified and noncalcified nodules seen on prior CTs are not well
 delineated radiographically.
 
 Old healed right-sided rib fractures noted. Degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal trace right pleural effusion and minimal atelectasis. Otherwise, no
 acute pulmonary process identified.
