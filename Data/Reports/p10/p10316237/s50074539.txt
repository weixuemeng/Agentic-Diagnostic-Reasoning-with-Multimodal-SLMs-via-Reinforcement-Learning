                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged, and slightly increased when
 compared to the prior study, though this may be partially attributable to
 lower lung volumes.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Mild pulmonary
 edema with small bilateral pleural effusions is new in the interval. Patchy
 opacities in lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax
 is identified. Marked degenerative changes are seen involving both
 acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints. Ossification of the anterior
 longitudinal ligament is seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
