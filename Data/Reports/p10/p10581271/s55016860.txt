                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain/dyspena
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Abandoned pacing leads are again demonstrated within the right chest wall and
 extend to the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette has increased compared to the previous study and appears
 somewhat globular.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  New ill-defined consolidative opacity
 is seen in the left lower lobe with associated small left pleural effusion. 
 Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are mild
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia with small
 left pleural effusion.
 2.  Increased size of the cardiac silhouette with a somewhat globular
 configuration.  This may be due to an underlying pericardial effusion and
 correlation with echocardiogram is suggested.
