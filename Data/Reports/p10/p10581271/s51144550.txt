 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pericardial drain in place in a
 patient with a history of pericardial effusion.  Opacification at the left
 base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. 
 Little change in the appearance of the dual-channel pacer device.
 The degree of vascular congestion has decreased, though some of this could
 reflect the more upright position of the patient.
