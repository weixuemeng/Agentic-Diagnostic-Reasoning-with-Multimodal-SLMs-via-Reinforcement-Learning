                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rheum dx NOS c/b pericardial effusion,
 pleural effusion, with new hypoxia  // eval for pulm edema, new effusions    
 eval for pulm edema, new effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently
 ___ and ___.
 
 Substantial increase in the caliber of the cardiac silhouette since ___, unchanged since ___, could be due to combination of cardiomegaly and
 pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest
 that a pericardial effusion if present is currently hemodynamically
 significant.  Left lower lobe collapse has worsened, accompanied with
 increasing small to moderate left pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable and there is no edema or pneumothorax.  Orphaned right atrial and
 right ventricular pacer leads are coiled in the right chest.
