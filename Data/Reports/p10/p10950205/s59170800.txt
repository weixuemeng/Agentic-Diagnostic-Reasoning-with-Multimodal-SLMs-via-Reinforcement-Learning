                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with HIV presents with hypotension, diarrhea and
 somnolence
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, as seen on the previous
 study.  The mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities potentially
 reflecting atelectasis.  Infection however cannot be completely excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.
