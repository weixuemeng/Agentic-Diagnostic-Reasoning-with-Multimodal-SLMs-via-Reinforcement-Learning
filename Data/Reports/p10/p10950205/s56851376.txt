                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film.  An
 ET tube is present and extends beyond the carina into the right mainstem
 bronchus.   Right IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely enlarged.  There are patchy opacities throughout both
 lungs, more pronounced in the lower lobes, with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm. Possible small effusions bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Bilateral alveolar opacities, most pronounced in the mid and lower zones,
 with small effusions.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 represent pulmonary edema.  
 
 2) ETT overlies the right mainstem bronchus and should be retracted
 approximately 2.5 - 3.0 cm. 
 
 3) Right IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium. If clinically
 indicated, this could also be retracted 2.5-3.0 cm.
