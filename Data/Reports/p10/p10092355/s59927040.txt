                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, intubated with altered mental status. 
 Evaluate placement of the tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms,
 suggestive of emphysematous disease.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable with the exception of extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the thoracic aorta.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is present.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm
 above the carina and an NG tube is present with the tip at the
 gastroesophageal junction and the side port within the terminal esophagus. 
 Calcifications in the right neck and right subclavicular region are likely
 vascular.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lung hyperinflation compatible with emphysema.  No focal parenchymal
 opacities to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta as well as
 vessels within the right neck and right infraclavicular region is observed.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position, ending 2.7 cm above the carina.
 NG tube has its tip at the gastroesophageal junction and the side port within
 the terminal esophagus.  Advancement is recommended.
