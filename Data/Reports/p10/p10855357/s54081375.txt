                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough for one month  // r/o infiltrate.     
 r/o infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there
 is moderate tortuosity of the descending aorta. No evidence of vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion. There is slight prominence of opacification at
 the left base on the frontal view, which is not confirmed on the lateral
 projection. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 conceivably represent a developing consolidation.
