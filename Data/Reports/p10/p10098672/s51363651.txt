                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Since the
 prior chest x-ray, right PICC has been removed, and a left-sided catheter has
 been placed, with tip terminating in the upper superior vena cava.  There is
 no visible pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities overlie the lower thoracic spine on
 the lateral radiograph and likely correspond to the left lower lobe given
 associated partial obscuration of the posterior left hemidiaphragm.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy left lower lobe opacity, most likely due to focal atelectasis in
 this recently postoperative patient.  Pneumonia is considered less likely, but
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
