                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dobhoff sp placement eval for correct
 location  // dobhoff in stomach?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is a new or repositioned enteric tube. The
 radiopaque tip and side-port overlie the expected location of the gastric
 fundus. The extreme distal portion of the radiopaque tip extends beyond the
 inferior edge of this film.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Radiopaque distal segment of enteric tube overlies the upper stomach; extreme
 distal tip of the tube is excluded from the film.
