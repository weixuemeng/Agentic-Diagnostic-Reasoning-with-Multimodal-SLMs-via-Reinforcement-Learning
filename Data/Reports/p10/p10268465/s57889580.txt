                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion, recent CABG and AVR  // eval PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ performed at 02:57, dated back
 to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, there has been an interval increase in moderate to severe bilateral
 pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  A right-sided tunneled
 line terminates in the right atrium.  A PICC line terminates over the mid/
 distal SVC .  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis
 has also increased compared to the prior exam.
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, with intact wires. The heart
 size is normal or slightly enlarged. Aside from a pulmonary vascular
 congestion, the hilar and mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in moderate to severe bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Increase in bibasilar atelectasis.  A superimposed infectious process
 cannot be excluded.
