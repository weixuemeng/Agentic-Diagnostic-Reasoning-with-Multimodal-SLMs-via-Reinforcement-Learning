 STATUS, INFILTRATES
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is less than a cm from the apex of the
 aortic knob, higher than generally placed.  Heart size is normal, but
 pulmonary edema is mild.  Hilar enlargement, presumably vascular, should be
 re-evaluated after hemodynamic status improves to exclude adenopathy.
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
