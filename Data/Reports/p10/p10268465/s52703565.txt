                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p AVR, CABG-- new Dob Hoff tube placed-
 evaluate position for advancement  // evaluate Dob Hoff
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube ext extends beneath the diaphragm with tip overlying stomach.
 Dual-lumen right subclavian line is present, with distal tip over right
 atrium. PICC line present. Tip obscured, but likely overlying mid/ distal SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Compared to the prior
 film, there is increased vascular plethora, consistent with increased CHF.
 Retrocardiac density again seen, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and probable small effusion. Patchy opacity at the right
 lung base remains visible.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening CHF.
 2. Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 3. Patchy opacity right base, the rectum similar to prior.
 4. Enteric tube tip overlies the expected location of the stomach. No
 radiopaque tip of this catheter is seen.
