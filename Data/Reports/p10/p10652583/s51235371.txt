                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yoM with sCHF exacerbation s/p diuresis with temp ___.2
 overnight.  // ___ yoM with sCHF exacerbation with temp ___.2 overnight. Any
 signs of aspiration/PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 09:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been interval clearing of the opacity
 at the right lung base, with only minimal residual subsegmental atelectasis
 there.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  No overt CHF.  No new
 focal infiltrate.  Extreme right costophrenic angles excluded from the film
 the presence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The left
 costophrenic sulcus is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval clearing of right base opacity.  No new focal infiltrate identified. 
 Small residual right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
