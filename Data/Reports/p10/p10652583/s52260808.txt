                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  Preop for small bowel obstruction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal films from earlier the same day and chest x-ray from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are streaky left
 basilar/retrocardiac opacities, potentially due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips again seen.  Enteric tube seen passing below the
 inferior field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacities, likely atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Please clinically correlate.
