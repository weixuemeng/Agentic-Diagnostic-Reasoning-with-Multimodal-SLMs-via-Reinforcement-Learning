                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT for respiratory failure  // Eval for ETT
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph taken earlier on the same day on ___:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is 5 cm above the carina.  Interval placement of NG tube as well with
 distal portion traversing B on the diaphragm and extending beyond the lower
 margins of the film.  Right subclavian PICC with tip in the SVC, position
 unchanged.  Low lung volumes bilaterally.  There is a new left mid lung
 opacity consistent with pneumonia.  There is increased opacity in the left
 lung base obscuring the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and pleural effusion.  There is inferior displacement of the minor
 fissures consistent with volume loss and increased collapse of the right
 middle lobe.  Cardiac size appears enlarged in this portable view but
 unchanged from previous.   There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left mid lung pneumonia
 
 Left lower lobe collapse with pleural effusion
 
 Increased right middle lobe volume loss and collapse
 
 ET tube tip is 5 cm above carina
