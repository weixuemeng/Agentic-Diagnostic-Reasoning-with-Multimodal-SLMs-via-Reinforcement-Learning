                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, diminished breath sounds L Lung  //
 Eval for fluid overload, acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies proximal SVC, unchanged.
 
 Again seen are low inspiratory volumes.  As before, there is moderately severe
 cardiomegaly prominence of both hila upper zone two-view shin and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema.  Increased
 retrocardiac density is similar to the previous film.  Opacity in the right
 infrahilar region is also overall similar.  The right hemidiaphragm may be
 slightly better defined.  Though there is likely some degree of pleural fluid,
 no gross effusion is seen on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued cardiomegaly.
 Continued CHF with interstitial edema.
 Retrocardiac density and confluent opacity in the right infrahilar region are
 overall similar to the prior film.  The differential diagnosis includes
 opacity due to alveolar edema, but underlying pneumonic infiltrates cannot be
 entirely excluded.
