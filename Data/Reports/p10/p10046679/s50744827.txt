 Minimal interval change in the appearance of the lungs with low inspiratory
 volumes, and findings suggestive of pulmonary edema.  There is however
 slightly increased aeration of the right infrahilar region.  There is a
 persisting retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to atelectasis and/or a small
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.

 significant interval change.
