                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Minimal biapical
 opacities are compatible with pleural parenchymal scarring.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural
 effusion.  No radiopaque foreign body.  There are mild calcifications of the
 aortic arch.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
