                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  There are bilateral interstitial
 opacities which may be due to moderate pulmonary edema, although atypical
 infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is
 persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains top normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the interstitial markings suggests moderate
 pulmonary edema; however, atypical infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
