                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with worsening delirium and leukocytosis, on
 methotrexate treatment, and history of lymphoma.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  If any, there is a small
 left pleural effusion.  Minimal left superior perihilar opacities could be due
 to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
