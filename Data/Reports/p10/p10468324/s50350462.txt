                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CNS lymphoma, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  Lung
 volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 region likely reflects atelectasis.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  Low lung volumes.
