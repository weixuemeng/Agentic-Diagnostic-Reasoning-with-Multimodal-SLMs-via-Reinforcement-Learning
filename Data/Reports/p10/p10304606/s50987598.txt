 mediastinal shift in that direction impossible, but there is the suggestion of
 persistent right lower lobe atelectasis.  Low lung volumes exaggerate vascular
 crowding and possible interstitial edema in the left lung but there has been
 no change in either over the past several days.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic, improved since ___.  No pneumothorax.
 
 NG tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view.  Right jugular
 line ends at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
