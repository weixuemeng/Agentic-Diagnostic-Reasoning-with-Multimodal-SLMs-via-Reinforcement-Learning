                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with endocarditis and AMS now with worsening
 ABG  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  The
 right IJ line is again seen, tip -- as before--  near cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 On the current study, the patient is markedly rotated, much more so than on
 the prior study.  This makes direct comparison to the prior study difficult.
 
 There appears to be upper zone redistribution, with diffuse vascular blurring
 and interstitial edema, consistent with CHF.  Patchy opacity at the right base
 with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is probably similar, allowing for differences in
 positioning.  The left hemidiaphragm remains distinctly visible.  The
 possibility of some retrocardiac opacity at the left base would be difficult
 to exclude due to positioning.  No gross left effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Somewhat limited assessment due to extreme the patient rotation.  Allowing for
 this, there appears to be  interval worsening of CHF findings, with evidence
 for interstitial edema.
 
 Patchy opacity at the right base right base and suspected retrocardiac density
 are probably unchanged.  Possible small right effusion, but no gross left
 effusion.
