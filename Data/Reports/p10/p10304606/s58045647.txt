                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MRSA endocarditis and pelvic phlegmon
 going to OR for washout.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is marked rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph,
 which severely limits assessment. Median sternotomy wires are again seen. A
 tracheostomy tube appears in grossly appropriate location. A left IJ central
 venous catheter has a similar orientation in comparison to prior radiograph,
 however due to rotation, position is unable to be accurately determined. 
 There is stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouettes. Diffuse
 interstitial prominence is similar in appearance to prior studies.  Blunting
 of the right lateral CP angle may represent a trace right pleural effusion.
 There is no obvious left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Severely limited study due to marked rotation.
 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly with stable diffuse interstitial prominence.
 3. No focal lung consolidation.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
