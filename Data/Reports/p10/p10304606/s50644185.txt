                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MRSA endocarditis  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 ET tube tip 4.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip extending beneath diaphragm,
 off film.  Right IJ central line tip overlies upper right atrium.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged as is what may be an enlarged left pulmonary hilum.  Sternotomy
 wires noted.
 
 Probable CHF.  Allowing for differences in technique, this may be very
 slightly improved compared to the prior study.  No gross effusions.  Small
 right effusion noted.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible minimal improvement in CHF findings.  Otherwise, doubt significant
