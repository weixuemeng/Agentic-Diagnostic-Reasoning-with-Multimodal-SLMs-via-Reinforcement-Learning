                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.  Slight
 decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours, and continued improvement in
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar predominantly retrocardiac opacities have slightly
 worsened, and may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and infectious
 pneumonia are additional considerations.  Small left pleural effusion is
 noted.
