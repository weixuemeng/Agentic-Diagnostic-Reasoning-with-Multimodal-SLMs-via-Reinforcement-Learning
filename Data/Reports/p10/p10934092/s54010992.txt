                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the
 distal stomach.  As compared to the prior study, there is no change in
 bilateral pleural effusions and mild-to-moderate vascular engorgement as well
 as in the position of the supporting tubes and lines.
