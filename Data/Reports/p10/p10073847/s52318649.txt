                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lungs again
 demonstrate linear areas of atelectasis at both bases.  No new areas of
 consolidation are identified, but note is made of prominent central
 peribronchial cuffing, which could be secondary to bronchitis or aspiration in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
