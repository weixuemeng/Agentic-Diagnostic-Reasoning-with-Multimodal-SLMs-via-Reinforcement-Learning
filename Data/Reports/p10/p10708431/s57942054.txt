                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male status post fall, pneumothorax, subcutaneous
 emphysema, and rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP upright portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs. 
 
 FINDINGS: There is still extensive but slightly reduced subcutaneous emphysema
 seen globally. Mediastinal emphysema may be slightly worse than prior study. 
 No pneumothorax is identified, however, given the subcutaneous emphysema, it
 is difficult to completely assess.  Lungs are well inflated with no obvious
 areas of focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous and mildly calcified.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval decrease in subcutaneous emphysema.  Possible
 slight increase in mediastinal emphysema.  No pneumothorax is identified,
 however, study is limited by extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
