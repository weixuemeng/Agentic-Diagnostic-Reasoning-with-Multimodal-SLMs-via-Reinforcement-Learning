 pleural air would be difficult to detect in the setting of persistent severe
 subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.  Left basal atelectasis has
 cleared.  Emphysema is severe.  There is probably a small to moderate left
 pneumothorax, which has remained stable since the earliest chest radiographs
 here on ___.  Heart is not enlarged.
