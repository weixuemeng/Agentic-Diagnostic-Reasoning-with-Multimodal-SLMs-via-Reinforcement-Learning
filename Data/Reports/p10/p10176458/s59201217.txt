                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post AAA repair, now with increased work of
 breathing.  Assess for effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates right internal jugular
 central venous catheter projecting over mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing through the esophagus, its tip out of view.  Costophrenic angles are
 obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities may
 represent atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities with small pleural effusions, may represent atelectasis or
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
