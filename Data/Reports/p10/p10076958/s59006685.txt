 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after esophageal dilatation.  Rule out
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no air in the upper mediastinum.  At the level of the
 gastric pull-up, the difficult to detect pneumomediastinum and separated from
 the gastric folds and adjacent atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Lungs are clear and the heart is normal size.  If symptoms
