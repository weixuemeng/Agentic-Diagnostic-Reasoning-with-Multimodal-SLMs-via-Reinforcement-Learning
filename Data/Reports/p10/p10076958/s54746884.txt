                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, wbc, hypoxemia  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The patient is status post gastric pull-up with
 parenchymal opacification demonstrated over the lower mediastinal contour on
 the right, as before.  There are diffuse reticular, interstitial opacities,
 particularly at the left base which likely reflect edema. There is some
 increased perihilar fullness, particularly on the left which is consistent
 with volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse, interstitial opacities, predominantly at the left base likely refect
 pulmonary edema, however superimposed infection/ aspiration should be
 considered given the clinical history.
