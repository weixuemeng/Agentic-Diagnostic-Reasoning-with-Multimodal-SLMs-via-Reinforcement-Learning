  1. Anterior intrathoracic lucency seen on lateral view only is indeterminate
  due to quality of film.  Recommend repeat lateral radiograph for further
  assessment.
  2. Stable postoperative appearance of the neo-esophagus with adjacent right
  middle lobe platelike atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with multiple nausea s/p esphogeal cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again noted is a postoperative esophagus.  Opacity adjacent to the right
 mediastinal border is unchanged, likely platelike atelectasis, improved since
 prior.  Assessment of the retrosternal region is limited due to technical
 limitations of the lateral radiograph.  No definite pneumothorax is seen on AP
 view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits. 
 The right hilum is obscured; the left hilum is within normal limits.  There is
 no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable postoperative appearance of the neo-esophagus with adjacent
 platelike atelectasis, improved since prior.
 2. No convincing evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, but lateral
 radiograph is technically suboptimal and at may be repeated at no additional
 charge to more fully exclude this possibility if warranted clinically.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 On the telephone on ___ at 6:___ AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
