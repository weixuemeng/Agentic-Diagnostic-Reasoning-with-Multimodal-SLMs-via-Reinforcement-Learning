                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new shortness of breath/increased work of
 breathing in context of hypovolemic hyponatremia  // ? interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are again
 remarkable for a distended neo esophagus.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures.  New bilateral interstitial opacities in the mid
 and lower lungs may be due to interstitial edema or, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, an atypical pneumonia.
