                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sob, new tachy  // ?pe, ptx, pna      ?pe,
 ptx, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dramatic interval change in the appearance of the lower neo esophagus.  Dr.
 ___ ___ me that the patient has had recent, interval upper abdominal surgery
 and I do not know what the radiographic appearance was or should have been
 following that surgery.
 
 It is unclear whether the neo esophagus is distended by a large bezoar or
 whether there is intussusception of the more distal GI tract into the neo
 esophagus or alongside the neo esophagus into the mediastinum.  A small volume
 of subdiaphragmatic gas could be explained by recent surgery, a but
 radiographically I cannot exclude perforation and pneumoperitoneum as well as
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 Heart size is normal but mild interstitial edema is new.  Opacity at the base
 the left lung is atelectasis.  There is no good evidence for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Interpret this study in conjunction with scheduled
 contrast swallow, to see if CT scanning is indicated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr. ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 9:49 AM, one minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
