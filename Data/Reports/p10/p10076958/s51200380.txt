                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:42
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right chest tube status post
 thoracotomy, now to waterseal, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:47.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable mediastinal contours in this patient status post
 esophagogastrectomy with the nasogastric tube projecting in an unchanged
 position.  A mediastinal drain remains in place.  A right chest tube remains
 in place and the tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable.  However, there is
 increasing bibasilar airspace opacity along with perihilar congestion and
 layering bilateral effusions.  These findings together likely reflect interval
 development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 also likely given the pleural effusions.  Overall, cardiac size is stable.
