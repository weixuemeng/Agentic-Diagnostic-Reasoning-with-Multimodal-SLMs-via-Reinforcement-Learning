                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of esophageal adenocarcinoma status post MIE, here to
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 A right apical chest tube is unchanged in position with right chest wall
 subcutaneous emphysema, not significantly changed from ___. 
 Increased opacification along the right mediastinal border with air-fluid
 level and surgical clips projecting over the right upper mediastinum are
 compatible with minimally-invasive esophagectomy.  A small right apical
 pneumothorax is new.  Slightly increased opacification of the right lung base
 may reflect increased atelectasis or increased small right pleural effusion. 
 A small left pleural effusion is decreased.  There is persistent retrocardiac
 opacification and left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits and stable otherwise.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of small right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Slightly increased right basilar atelectasis and/or small pleural
 effusion.
 3.  Decreased small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ Thoracic
 ___ via telephone at 3:55 p.m. on ___.
