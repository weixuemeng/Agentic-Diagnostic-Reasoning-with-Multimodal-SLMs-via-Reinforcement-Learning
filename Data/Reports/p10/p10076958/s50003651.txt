                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Vomiting.  Question aspiration.  Prior esophagectomy with gastric
 pull-up.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The right lower mediastinal contour, with
 associated parenchymal opacification, shows renewed prominence which may
 indicate dilatation of the gastric pull-up, increased atelectasis associated
 with the contour abnormality caused by the pull-up, or perhaps combination of
 both. Particularly given that other areas of the lungs appear clear,
 aspiration pneumonitis is doubtful as the etiology. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. A lower thoracic compression deformity appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right lower mediastinal contour suggesting a dilatation of gastric
 pull-up, increased atelectasis associated with contour abnormality due to the
 pull-up or both; this type of appearance appears to have waxed and waned on
 prior films. Obstruction of the pull-up is a possibility to consider
 clinically in the setting of recent vomiting.
