                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with lethargy.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  Blunting at the left costophrenic sulcus is unchanged and
 may be due to a small effusion or pleural thickening.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.  The mediastinal silhouette with an enlarged aorta is stable.  A
 left humeral head fracture is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or edema.
