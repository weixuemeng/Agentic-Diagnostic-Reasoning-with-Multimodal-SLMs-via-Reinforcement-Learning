 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis.  Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Linear opacities at the bases are likely atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is notable for a tortuous aorta.  The bones are intact.
