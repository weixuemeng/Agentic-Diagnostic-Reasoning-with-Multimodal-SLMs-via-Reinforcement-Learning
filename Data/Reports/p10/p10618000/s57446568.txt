                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Positive PPD.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle is likely
 pericardial fat.  Differential diagnosis includes pericardial cyst, less
 likely a hernia or lymphadenopathy.  There are calcified granulomas in the
 right upper lobe and probably calcified lymph nodes in the left hilum.  There
 is no evidence of lung consolidations, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. 
 Mild degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute TB.
