                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with unresponsiveness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
 tip terminates in the right atrium.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The
 aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise grossly unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Lungs appear hyperinflated.
 Small left pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.  Please note that infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Possible trace left pleural
 effusion.
