                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A left-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the right atrium.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  Evidence of a large hiatal hernia is again seen
 and elevation of the posterior left hemidiaphragm.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis
 is seen.  There is no focal consolidation.  Slight blunting of the posterior
 right costophrenic angle may be artifactual, although trace pleural effusion
 is not excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The aorta remains calcified and
 unfolded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation.  Slight blunting of the posterior right
 costophrenic angle may be artifactual, although trace pleural effusion not
 excluded.
 
 2.  Hiatal hernia.
 
 3.  Persistent cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
