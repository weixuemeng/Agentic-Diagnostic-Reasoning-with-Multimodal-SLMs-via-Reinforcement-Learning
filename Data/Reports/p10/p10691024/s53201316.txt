                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New cough, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated, but appears mild to
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  The mediastinal contours
 otherwise unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present
 due to low lung volumes, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities are more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, and could
 reflect areas of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear nearly resolved, and
 no pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, more so on the left.  Findings
 could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
