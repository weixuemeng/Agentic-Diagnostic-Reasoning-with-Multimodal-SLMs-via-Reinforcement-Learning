                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and other indwelling devices remain in standard
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion has slightly improved, and bilateral partially layering
 pleural effusions have apparently decreased in size, although differences in
 positioning could contribute to this apparent change.  Adjacent basilar
 atelectasis is again demonstrated.
