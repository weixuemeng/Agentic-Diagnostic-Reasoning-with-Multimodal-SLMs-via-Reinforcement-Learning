                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Widening of
 the superior mediastinum is likely attributable to low lung volumes.  Hazy
 opacification in the retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no definite pulmonary edema.  Small left
 pleural effusion may be present.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with left basilar opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 Infection is not completely excluded.  Small left pleural effusion is not
 excluded.
