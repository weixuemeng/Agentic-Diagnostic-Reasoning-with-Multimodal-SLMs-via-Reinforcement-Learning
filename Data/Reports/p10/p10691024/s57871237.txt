                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left internal jugular central
 venous line placement, check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis was performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier.  Left-sided internal
 jugular approach central venous line has been placed, seen to cross the
 midline to the right and terminate with its tip in a markedly distended SVC at
 the level 1 cm above the carina.  No pneumothorax has developed. Chest
 findings are similar as before and include marked cardiomegaly, pulmonary
 congestion and atelectatic changes on the bases.
