                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lung nodules status post bilateral transbronchial biopsies.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacities in the right lower lobe and left upper lung represent a combination
 of the known lesions and post biopsy bleeding.  An oxygen mask obscures the
 right lung apex where there may be a small pneumothorax. No left pneumothorax.
 No pleural effusion.
 
 There is elevation of left hemidiaphragm from a massively distended,
 air-filled stomach.  No focal airspace consolidation worrisome for infection.
 Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  A marked dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracic spine is long-standing.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An oxygen mask obscures the right lung apex and might possibly obscure a small
 pneumothorax. A repeat chest radiograph is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
