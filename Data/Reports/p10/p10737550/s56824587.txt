                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with triple-vessel coronary artery
 disease, likely to become bypass candidate.  Evaluate preoperatively.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Somewhat low-positioned diaphragms
 and lucent appearance of lung bases suggest possibility of COPD, but again
 acute infiltrates cannot be seen.  Within the normal heart shadow, the lateral
 view discloses typical track-shaped calcifications in antero and left-sided
 position within the heart shadow identifying the left anterior descending
 artery.  No other intracardiac calcifications are identified.  Our records do
 not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal heart size, no evidence of pulmonary congestion,
 unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta, but extensive calcifications in the
 area of the LAD.
