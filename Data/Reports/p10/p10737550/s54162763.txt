                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, to assess for left effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  There is increasing opacification at the left base, suggesting
 worsening pleural effusion, though some of the change could be a manifestation
 of the more upright posture of the patient.  Smaller right pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of vascular congestion.  Substantial volume loss
 is present in the left lower lobe.
