                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 734 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, evaluate for progression of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 956.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 734 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position.  Status post
 median sternotomy with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
 There is a patchy opacity at the left base with an associated small pleural
 effusion likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Interval decrease in size of a small left apical pneumothorax which is barely
 seen on the current examination.  Patchy opacity at the right base most likely
 reflects an area of atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  Interval appearance of retrocardiac opacity with blunting of
 the costophrenic angle suggestive of partial lower lobe compressive
 atelectasis due to the presence of a small effusion.
