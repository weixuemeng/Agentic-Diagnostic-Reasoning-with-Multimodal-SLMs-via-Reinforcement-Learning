                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea on exertion after reported smoke inhalation
 many years ago.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Tortuosity of the aorta is noted in particular at the
 level of the ascending aorta that might be consistent with dilatation.  Lungs
 are essentially clear except for nodular opacity in the left suprahilar area,
 approximately 10 mm in diameter that potentially might reflect add-on vessel
 but pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Correlation with anterior oblique views is required.
