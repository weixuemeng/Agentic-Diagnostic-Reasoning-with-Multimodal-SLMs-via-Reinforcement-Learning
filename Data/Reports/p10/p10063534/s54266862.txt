                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe cardiomegaly with slight increase in size compared to ___.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  A left anterior chest wall
 single-lead pacer is unchanged in position.  No focal consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia; however, left lung base is difficult to assess.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.  No frank interstitial edema.
 2.  Severe global cardiomegaly slightly increased in size from prior
 examination.  This could be due to pericardial effusion; however, no definite
 fat pad sign is seen. Conventional lateral view may be helpful to assess the
 left lung base.
