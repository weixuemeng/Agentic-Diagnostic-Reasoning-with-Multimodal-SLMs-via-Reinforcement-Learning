 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of both the left and the right lower lung zones.  There also is a

 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, the known multiple bilateral pulmonary
 metastases are better visualized than on the previous film.
