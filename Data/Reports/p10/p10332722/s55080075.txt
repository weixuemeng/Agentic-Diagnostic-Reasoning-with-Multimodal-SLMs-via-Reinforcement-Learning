                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with VRE UTI, metastatic bladder cancer and
 persistent leukocytosis and new shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and a CT torso ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Moderate-sized right pleural effusion and
 heterogeneous opacification of the retrocardiac right lower lobe is new and is
 worrisome for pneumonia.  Multiple additional nodular opacities in both lungs
 as seen in the left lower lobe appear minimally larger since the prior study,
 worrisome for progression of known metastatic disease.  Right upper extremity
 PICC terminates in the cavo-atrial junction.  Linear left basal atelectasis is
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Mild progression of metastatic disease.
 
 3.  Right upper extremity PICC tip in the cavo-atrial junction.
