  limited study due to low lung volumes. Retraction of PICC by 2.5-3.0  cm is
  recommended for better positioning. Multiple bilateral opacities are again
  noted and consistent with patient's known pulmonary metastasis. Partially
  locualted right pleural effusion and adjacent opacity are again seen. Mild
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of mild edema.There is
  elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Relative lucency at the right lung base
  is likely due to overlying of pulmonary findings as opposed to free air on
  this supine film, however correlation with examination is recommended and an
  upright film may be obtained for better evaluation if necessary. Large bowel
  again appears distended consitent with functional dilatation of the large
  bowel. Lytic rib lesion in the left eighth rib laterally again noted

  Retraction of PICC by 3-3.5 cm is recommended for better positioning. Multiple
  bilateral opacities are again noted and consistent with patient's known

  suggestive of mild edema.There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
  Relative lucency at the right lung base is likely due to overlying of

  correlation with examination is recommended and an upright film may be
  obtained for better evaluation if necessary. Large bowel again appears
  distended consitent with functional dilatation of the large bowel. Lytic rib
  lesion in the left eighth rib laterally again noted, likely in the process of
  fracturing.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with right PICC line, possible PICC migration by 2 cm,
 tachycardia, shortness of breath, PICC line migration?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right-sided PICC line ends either at cavoatrial junction or upper atrium. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is new.  There is also increase in right lower lung
 pleural effusion with atelectasis.  Increase in size of the mediastinum is due
 to vascular engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The lung metastases are hard to assess throughout the lung abnormalities.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided PICC line is in upper atrium or cavoatrial junction.
 
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema is new.
 
 3.  Increase in at least moderate right lower lung collapse and pleural
 effusion.
