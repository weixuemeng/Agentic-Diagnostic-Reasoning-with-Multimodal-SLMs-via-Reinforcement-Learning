                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown etiology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with mild calcification of the aortic knob.  Hilar contours are stable. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Innumerable pulmonary nodules are seen
 in both lungs compatible with metastatic disease.  Small right pleural
 effusion appears increased in size compared to the prior exam.  There is
 associated right basilar opacity which may reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity also may reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.  A
 lytic lucency within the left proximal humerus measuring 9 mm is not fully
 assessed on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased size of small right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2. Bilateral pulmonary metastases, relatively unchanged compared to the prior
 exam.
 
 3. 9 mm lytic lesion in the left humeral head, incompletely assessed, but
 concerning for metastasis.
