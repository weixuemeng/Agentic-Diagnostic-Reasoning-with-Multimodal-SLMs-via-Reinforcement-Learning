                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, heart block, status post pacing, hypotension, short of breath,
 pulmonary edema.  Assess for effusion, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ at 11:12 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the overall appearance is fairly similar.  There
 is slight increase in a small effusion at the right base, associated with a
 small amount of collapse and/or consolidation.  Patchy opacity at the left
 base with retrocardiac density and partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora ,and
 diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema, is
 similar to the prior film.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The
 left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle also
 appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with interstitial edema.  Bibasilar patchy opacities and
 probable small effusions.  Very slight increase in the right effusion compared
 with ___.
