 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cirrhosis, HCC, anemia, presenting with shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Given this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable, as are the hilar contours.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
