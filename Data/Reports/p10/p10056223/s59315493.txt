                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant, assess interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 2:56 a.m., slight increase in density in the right
 lung appears to represent a layering pleural effusion.  Possible slight
 increase in density at left lower lobe, could reflect slight worsening lof the
 previously seen left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette, ET tube, and NG tube are grossly unchanged. 
 Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the proximalmost right pulmonary
 artery, slightly advanced compared with prior film.  A line or other
 catheter/drain overlies the right upper quadrant.  Old healed right-sided rib
 fractures incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged compared to the prior film.  Possible
 slight improvement in CHF findings.  Possible slight worsening of left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation with increased visibility of layering right
 effusion.  Right Swan-Ganz catheter tip now overlies the proximalmost right
 pulmonary artery.
