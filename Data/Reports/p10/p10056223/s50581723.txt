                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with shortness of breath, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are again low lung
 volumes which may account for some of the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.  Specifically, no acute focal pneumonia.
