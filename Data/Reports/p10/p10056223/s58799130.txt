 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hepatocellular carcinoma with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lung
 volumes are low, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 subtle bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  There appears to be an old fracture of the posterior right fourth
 rib.
