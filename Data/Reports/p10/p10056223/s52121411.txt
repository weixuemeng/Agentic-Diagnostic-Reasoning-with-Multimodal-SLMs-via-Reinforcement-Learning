                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest congestion and cough, with intermittent fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Given this, no definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  Subtle left base opacity likely represents atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Evidence of an old right posterior fourth rib fracture is again seen.
 There may be minimal pleural thickening along the lateral right lower
 hemithorax, unchanged as compared to the prior radiograph, although not seen
 on CT from ___, and may be artifactual.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
