 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  The heart demonstrates left ventricular
 configuration and the aorta is tortuous.  No focal areas of consolidation are
 present within the lungs, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
