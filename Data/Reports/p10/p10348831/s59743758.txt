  1. The right PICC terminates at the T7-8 level, similar to the chest
  radiograph from approximately 5 hours earlier.
  2.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged, with slightly improved lung
  volumes and a persistent layering right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___M child C ETOH cirrhosis (c/b grade II
 varices, ascites, HE), CAD s/p stents, recent hospitalization for alcoholic
 hepatitis, p/w SOB and increased abd girth, found to have PVT, hepatic
 hydrothorax.  // Is there any shift in the position of the PICC line?    Is
 there any shift in the position of the PICC line?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 17:53 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continues to be a moderate layering right effusion with patchy opacity
 at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left lung remains grossly clear. A feeding
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with tip not identified.  The right
 subclavian PICC line is unchanged with its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction. Interval removal of the right internal jugular central
 line. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable despite
 patient rotation on the current study.  No pneumothorax.
