                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Infiltrate and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent PET-CT scan
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus and
 flattening of the hemidiaphragmatic contour suggest a small pleural effusion. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is nonspecific.  On the prior study, there was a known
 mass that may partly account for this appearance, but associated atelectasis
 or superimposed pneumonia are not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest.  Standard PA and lateral
 radiographs may be helpful in short-term follow-up if pulmonary symptoms are
 present and were to persist.
