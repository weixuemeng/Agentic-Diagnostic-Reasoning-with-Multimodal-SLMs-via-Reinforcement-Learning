                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New chest pain after a left thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam performed after the earlier thoracentesis,
 there appears to have been a slight increase in the residual left pleural
 effusion.  It remains small in size.  Again, some left basilar atelectasis
 persists.  There are persistent fibrotic changes at the bases.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very slight interval increase in the size of the small residual
 left pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
