                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer with left-sided pleural effusion status
 post thoracentesis.  Evaluate for recurrence.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT, ___, chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large left pleural effusion has reaccumulated compared to
 immediate prior examination from ___ and appears slightly increased in
 volume compared to the pre-thoracentesis examination from the same day.  The
 pleural effusion exerts local mass effect with mild adjacent compressive
 atelectasis as well as rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  Heart size
 is difficult to evaluate due to obscuration of the heart border by the
 effusion.  The left superior hilar contour and the right hilar contour is
 unremarkable.  The left apex and right lung are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reaccumulation of large left-sided pleural effusion, increased in
 volume compared to pre-thoracentesis examination from ___.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 10:09AM on ___ at time of initial review.
