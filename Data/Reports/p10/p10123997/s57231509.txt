                                 FINAL REPORT
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Pleurx
 catheter with removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left base could reflect atelectatic
 change or possibly some re-expansion edema.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.
