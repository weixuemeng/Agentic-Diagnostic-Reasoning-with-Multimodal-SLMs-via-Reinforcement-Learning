                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tachycardia, question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding
 in the lower lungs. Given history provided, minimal opacity in the right lower
 lung due to aspiration cannot be excluded given technical limitations.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe opacity could be secondary to aspiration. Limited
 exam.
