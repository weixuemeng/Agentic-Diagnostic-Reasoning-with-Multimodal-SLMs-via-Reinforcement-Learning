                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoking history, to assess for COPD changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs on
 the lateral view, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of chronic pulmonary
 disease.  However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
