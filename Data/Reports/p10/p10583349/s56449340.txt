                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient postoperative day 3 for right lower
 extremity bypass with history of coronary artery disease, now with new
 crackles at bases, evaluate for interval change, - volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding postoperative supine chest examination of ___. 
 Heart size suggests mild enlargement but not significantly different from what
 has been identified on the preoperative chest examination of ___.
 Thoracic aorta unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any major fluid
 accumulations.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area on the
 frontal view.  A right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line is
 present and seen to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures
 at the level 2 cm below the carina.  This is compatible with the mid portion
 of the SVC.  No pneumothorax has developed.  No new parenchymal infiltrates
 are present.  A local thickening of the minor fissure is noted, but such
 finding existed already on the next preceding postoperative supine
 examination.
