                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with productive cough  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent left hemidiaphragm elevation, with resulting left basilar
 atelectasis.  However, superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Prominent interstitial markings are
 unchanged across multiple prior examinations, and suggests underlying chronic
 lung disease.  Right lung is otherwise essentially clear.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart is normal in size.  Right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.
 Significant wedge compression of the lower thoracic spine with resulting
 kyphosis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar consolidation, largely due to compressive atelectasis in the
 setting of left hemidiaphragm elevation.  However, superimposed pneumonia
 would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise
 no relevant change compared to ___.
