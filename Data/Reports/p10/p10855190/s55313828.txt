                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pain on the right side.  Please evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Redemonstrated is lingular scarring with left hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation, slightly worse compared to the prior exam.  Increased opacity at
 the right lung base reflects minimal atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia are
 identified.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  No definite rib fracture is identified.
 
 Compression deformities of the lower thoracic spine appear overall stable
 compared to the CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No definite rib fracture identified; however, a dedicated rib series would be
 recommended for further evaluation if there is further clinical concern.
