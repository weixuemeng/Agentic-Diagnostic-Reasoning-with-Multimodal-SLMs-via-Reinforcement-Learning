                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, AP upright and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality suggesting
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate relative elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right appears unchanged.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.  Surgical clips project along the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate interstitial abnormality most suggestive of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
