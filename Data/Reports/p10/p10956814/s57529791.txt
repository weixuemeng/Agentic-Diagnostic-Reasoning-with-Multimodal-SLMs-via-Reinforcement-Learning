                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall, now with rib pain.  Evaluate for fracture or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms, suggesting chronic underlying
 obstructive disease.  Lungs are clear without focal abnormality.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Chronic-appearing right-sided rib fractures are
 again seen.  No acute displaced rib fracture is visualized.  Compression
 deformity of a mid-thoracic vertebral body is similar to prior.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Chronic right rib fractures without acute displaced rib fracture.  
 2.  Emphysema.
