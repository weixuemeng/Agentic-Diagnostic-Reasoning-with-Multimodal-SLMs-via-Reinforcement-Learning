                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The previously seen lucency along the right chest
 wall is no longer present and most likely represented a summation of shadows.
 
 Persistent opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of
 pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
