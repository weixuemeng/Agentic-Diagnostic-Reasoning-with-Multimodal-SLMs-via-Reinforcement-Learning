                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier on this date, there has
 been a right thoracentesis with removal of substantial amount of pleural
 fluid.  There is subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall, but no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The apparent increase in left effusion could well
 be due to differences in positioning.
