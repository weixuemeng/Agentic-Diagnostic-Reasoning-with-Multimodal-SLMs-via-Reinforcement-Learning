                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable, allowing
 for differences in technique, including mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A new focal perihilar opacity in the
 left upper lobe could be seen with pneumonia but not specific. Remodeled
 fractures of the right posterior ninth and tenth ribs appear old.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  There is mild chronic appearing loss in height among
 several lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left upper lobe.  It is fairly typical for
 pneumonia, but other etiologies such as contusion could be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 resolution within eight weeks.
