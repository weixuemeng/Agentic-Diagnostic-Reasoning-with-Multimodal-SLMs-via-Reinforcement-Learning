                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent diagnosis of a pneumonia with
 palpitations and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Hazy opacity again projects
 over the left mid to upper lung as on prior.  There is no new confluent
 consolidation.   The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in
 configuration.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Increased opacity
 projecting over one of the posterior costophrenic angles could be due to a
 small effusion but is not significantly changed since previous exam.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since exam several days prior with
 patchy opacity in the left mid to upper lung.  Possible small pleural effusion
 unchanged.
