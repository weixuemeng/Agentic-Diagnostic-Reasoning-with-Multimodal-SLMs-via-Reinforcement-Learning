                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with multiple falls from her wheelchair and history of
 pathological fractures.  // We are looking for pathological fractures and
 hemothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from ___, there is little overall change.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.  There is central vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  No focal parenchymal opacity. Chronic right
 posterior deformity is noted.  No new rib fractures identified on this
 non-rib-dedicated radiograph.  Compression deformity of the upper thoracic
 spine, better assessed on prior CT from ___, correlates with a chronic
 T4 compression fracture.  Extensive calcification along the costochondral
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Chronic T4 compression fracture, better assessed on prior CT from ___.
