                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with assault, facial bone fracture, aspiration,
 intubated.  Rule out interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___, CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lower lobe consolidations seen on recent CT were probably related to
 lung collapse.  This has significantly improved on today's chest x-ray.  ET
 tube ends 3.7 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in stomach.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Bibasilar consolidation has significantly improved since CT torso.  These
 consolidations on the CT look like lobar collapse.
