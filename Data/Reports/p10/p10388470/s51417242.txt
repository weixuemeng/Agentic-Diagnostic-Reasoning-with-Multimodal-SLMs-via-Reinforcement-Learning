                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with sob  // ?pna, ? pl eff
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation made to CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
 Associated atelectasis is noted in noting that superimposed infection
 particularly at the right base cannot be excluded.  Coarse interstitial
 markings are seen superiorly, likely in part due to emphysema.  Cardiac
 silhouette cannot be adequately assessed.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.  More dense
 consolidation at the right lung base raises possibility of superimposed
 infection.
