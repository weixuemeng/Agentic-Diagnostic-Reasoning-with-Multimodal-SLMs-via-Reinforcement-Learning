  1. Low lung volumes and respiratory motion limit the evaluation.
  2. Faint left retrocardiac opacity could reflect vascular crowding and
  atelectasis given low lung volumes.  However, in the proper clinical setting
  pneumonia cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low and respiratory motion limits the evaluation.  Faint left
 retrocardiac opacity is also seen on the lateral view projecting over the
 spine.   Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and is likely top
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes and respiratory motion limit the evaluation.
 2. Faint left retrocardiac opacity could reflect vascular crowding and
 atelectasis given low lung volumes.  However, in the proper clinical setting
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
