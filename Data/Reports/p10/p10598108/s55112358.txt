                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 05:39 a.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Contrast material is projecting over the kidney on the right, most likely from
 prior contrast injection.  Left basal opacity is noted, potentially reflecting
 pneumonia in the left lower lobe versus atelectasis.  Aspiration is another
 possibility given the patient's history of cardiac arrest.
