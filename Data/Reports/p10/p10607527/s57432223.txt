                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary
 hypertension, now presenting with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse interstitial opacities correspond with
 patient's known underlying pulmonary fibrosis.  However, compared to the scout
 image from chest CT from ___, there are overall increased
 interstitial opacities.  Additionally, there is enlargement of the hilar
 contours and cardiac silhouette.  The above collection of findings suggest
 superimposed moderate pulmonary edema.  Probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions are also present.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable moderate interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed upon
 background pulmonary fibrosis. The ddx could include fibrosis with
 superimposed interstital pneumonia, though this is considered less likely.
