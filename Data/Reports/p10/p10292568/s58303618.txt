                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with generalized weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation. Heart size is at least moderately
 enlarged. Aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal contour is difficult to assess given
 the degree of patient rotation. There may be minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Linear
 opacities at the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to rotation. Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
