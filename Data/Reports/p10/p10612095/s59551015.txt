 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there now is an obvious

 slightly retractile character, reflected by the partial elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm in its posterior portion.  There also is a small associated
 plate-like atelectasis.  In light of the clinical history, the presence of
 pneumonia is likely.
 
 No other lung parenchymal changes.  Known coronary stent.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
