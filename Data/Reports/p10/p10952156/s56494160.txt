                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, seizure  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is new retrocardiac opacification
 which likely corresponds to left lower lobe collapse.  There is moderate
 central vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  Significantly
 calcified aortic arch is again noted.  Elevation of the left mainstem bronchus
 is likely a function of left atrial enlargement.  There is likely a small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate stable cardiomegaly
 Center vascular congestion and upper zone redistribution.  Likely small left
 pleural effusion.
