                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with afib on xarelto, recent urologic procedure with bloody
 urine, fall at home, now hypotensive, evaluate for volume overload, fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Atelectasis is present at the left lung base, but there is no focal
 consolidation. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion are
 noted.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Osseous structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or
 other trauma is clinically warranted, the location where there are focal
 findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or
 CT scanning.
