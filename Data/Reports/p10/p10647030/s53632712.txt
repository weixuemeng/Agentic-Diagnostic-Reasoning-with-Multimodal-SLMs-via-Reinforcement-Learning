 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cholangitis and hypoxia, question
 edema, question worsening pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A PA and lateral chest, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continued to be bilateral airspace opacities which could represent
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 contours of the effusions suggest that the fluid may be somewhat loculated,
 particularly on the right.   There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A portion of a biliary stent
 is again visualized.  Overall, there does not appear to be any significant
 interval change.  No pneumothorax.
