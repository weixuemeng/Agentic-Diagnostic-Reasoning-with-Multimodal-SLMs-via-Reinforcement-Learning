                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough and intermittent
 fevers and weight loss.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are clear of focal opacity or large confluent
 consolidation.  Minimal linear opacity seen at the left lung base on the
 frontal view, not visualized on the lateral, which could be due to
 atelectasis.  The costophrenic angles are sharp.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Hypertrophic change is seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal left basilar opacity on the frontal view, potentially due
 to atelectasis.  Possibility of infection is not completely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation recommended.
