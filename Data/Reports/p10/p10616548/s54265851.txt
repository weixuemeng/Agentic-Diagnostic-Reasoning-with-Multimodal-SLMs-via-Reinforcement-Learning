 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening respiratory distress, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with bilateral relatively
 extensive parenchymal opacities.  The appearance of these opacities and their
 distribution suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
