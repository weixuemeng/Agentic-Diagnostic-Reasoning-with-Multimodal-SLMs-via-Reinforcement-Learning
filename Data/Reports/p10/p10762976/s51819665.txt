                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pleuritic R chest pain  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures the
 making it impossible to exclude mild pulmonary edema. Portions of the right
 hemidiaphragm and right heart border are obscured by a and adjacent airspace
 opacity. Streaky bibasilar atelectasis is present. The upper lung zones are
 clear.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small. There is no pneumothorax. The
 patient is status post median sternotomy. Mild cardiomegaly is noted,
 exaggerated by technique and poor inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New airspace opacity overlying the right heart border is compatible with
 pneumonia. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions suggest concurrent cardiac decompensation. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 Mild cardiomegaly.
