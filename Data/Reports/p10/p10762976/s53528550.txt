 COMPARISON:  ___

 As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have increased and the
 signs indicative of mild fluid overload have completely resolved. Nonetheless,
 small bilateral pleural effusions are still present and are better appreciated
 on the lateral than on the frontal image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The
 alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged.
