                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia, oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing multifocal pneumonia. 
 These changes are evident at both lung bases.  The lung apices are bilaterally
 spared from the pathologic process.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Mild over distention of the stomach, unchanged
 normal alignment of the sternal wires.
