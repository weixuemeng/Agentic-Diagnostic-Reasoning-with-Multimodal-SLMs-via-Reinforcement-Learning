                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest discomfort and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a coarse opacity involving the right lung that probably
 represents residual from a marked inflammatory process involving the right
 lung, as seen on earlier radiographs from ___, having mostly
 resolved since that study; however right lung opacities may be slightly more
 prominent than on the more recent prior study.  Lesser residual changes are
 seen in the left mid lung.  There is a small suspected residual left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague multifocal opacities, similar to perhaps slightly more
 prominent than on the most recent prior study, although markedly improved
 since the earlier examination.  This appearance does not represent a definite
 change and may correlate with residual mild opacification from a marked
 resolving inflammatory process.  However, subtle recurrence of pneumonia is
 hard to exclude, and short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to
 evaluate further if pulmonary symptoms are present.  No evidence for free air
 or pneumomediastinum.
