 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, questionable ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are constant.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.9 cm above
 the carina.  The parenchymal opacity at the left lung apex is minimally
 decreasing in extent.  The extensive right-sided opacity is unchanged. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and
 unchanged minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially
 reflecting a small pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
