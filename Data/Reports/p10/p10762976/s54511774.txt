                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  An ET tube is present, tip in
 satisfactory position approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  A left-sided
 PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.  An NG tube is present, tip and
 side port beneath diaphragm, extending off film. 
 
 There is diffuse alveolar opacity and air bronchograms throughout the right
 lung, with relative sparing of the right lung apex and minimal residual
 lucency at the right base.  This has progressed compared with ___. 
 Possibility of an associated effusion cannot be excluded.  
 
 There is also prominent  focal interstitial and alveolar opacity in the left
 upper zone, which appears more confluent than on the earlier film.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 unchanged.  The small left effusion is slightly more prominent on this exam.
 There is relative lucency at the left lung apex.  However, I doubt this
 represents a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs, progressed compared with
 ___ at 12:09 p.m.  Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonic
 infiltrates, ARDS and CHF.
