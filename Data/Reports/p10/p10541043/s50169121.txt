 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right trans subclavian pacer leads follow their expected courses from the
 right pectoral generator.  No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening, or pleural
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged due to cardiomegaly
 and/or pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal venous engorgement to
 suggest elevated central venous pressure, and no pulmonary edema.  Mild upper
 lobe pulmonary vascular distention is of uncertain chronicity and probably
 exaggerated by semi supine positioning.
