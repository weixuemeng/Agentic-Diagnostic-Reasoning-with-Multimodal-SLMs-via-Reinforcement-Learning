                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with exertional dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  There is asymmetry to the radiodensity of
 the hila.  The left is more radiodense than expected and in the lateral view,
 there is a rounded contour projecting anterior to the normal hilar structures.
 Recommend shallow and routine ___ (right anterior oblique) views to see if
 there is a perihilar nodule on the left.  No evidence of adenopathy elsewhere
 in the chest, mediastinal contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  Azygos
 fissure is anatomically insignificant.
