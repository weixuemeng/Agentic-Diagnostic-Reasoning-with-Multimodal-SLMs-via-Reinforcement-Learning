  There is an interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion, with
  increasing cephalization of vessels, as well as a more prominent azygos vein,
  without definite evidence of interstitial edema. There may be a small left
  pleural effusion similar to the prior exam, however a lateral radiograph may
  be helpful for further evaluation. The possibility of pericardial fluid can't
  be excluded on this exam. ___ were d/w Dr. ___ at 1p on the day of the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe pre-eclampsia, now on magensium for
 seizure prophylaxis, with new bilateral fine crackles on physical exam  //
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 unchanged, but remains enlarged. On the current exam, there is slightly
 increased cephalization of vessels and probably slight increase in the degree
 of opacity at the right lung base. No gross effusion. The azygos vein remains
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, without significant change. The possibility of associated
 pericardial fluid cannot be excluded.
 2. Persistence azygos enlargement suggesting right heart failure.
 3. Upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora slightly more pronounced.
 Subtle confluent opacity may now be present at the right base. No air
 bronchograms or frank consolidation is identified. No effusions detected.
