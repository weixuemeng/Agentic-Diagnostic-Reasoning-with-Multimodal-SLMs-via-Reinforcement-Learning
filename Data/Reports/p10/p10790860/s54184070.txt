                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia and concern for PNA vs. pulmonary
 edema secondary to acute diastolic heart failure  // Rule out PNA vs.
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable position of left chest pacer device with associated dual leads
 projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle. There is sepsis stable
 position of right-sided PICC line with distal tip again not well visualized,
 projecting over the approximate mid to lower SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance. The bilateral
 hila are not well visualized.
 
 There are worsening right greater than left alveolar consolidations, likely
 signifying worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema ; in particular, the left lung
 field appears improved with evidence of decreasing pulmonary edema, while the
 right airspace opacities are worsened in comparison multiple prior
 radiographs. Given this appearance and asymmetric nature of progression with
 continued improvement of the left lung and continued worsening of the right,
 there is also concern for superimposed multifocal pneumonia.
 
 There are probably unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Continued worsening of right alveolar consolidations despite resolving
 pulmonary edema on left, concerning for right multifocal pneumonia
 superimposed on resolving pulmonary edema.
 2. Probably unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
