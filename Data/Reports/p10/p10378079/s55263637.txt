 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lymphoma and port  // Evaluate port, evaluate
 for infiltrates concerning for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Relatively symmetric paramediastinal
 opacities likely reflect post radiation changes.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Clips are seen in the right neck. 
 Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection.
 2. Paramediastinal symmetric opacities likely due to post radiation changes.
 3. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip in the mid SVC.
