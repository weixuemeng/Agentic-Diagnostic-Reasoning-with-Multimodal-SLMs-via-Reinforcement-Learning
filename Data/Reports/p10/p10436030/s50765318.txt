                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with trauma.  Please evaluate for rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is some atelectasis in the left lower lobe but the lungs are
 elsewhere clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures are
 appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of rib fracture or pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  If clinical concern for rib fracture persists, suggest dedicated
 rib series.
