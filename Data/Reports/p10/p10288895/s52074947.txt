                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  A scout view of the abdomen from ___ shows unchanged
 pleural thickening at the same site consistent with a benign finding.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Question pneumonia.  Patient presents with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  There is an dextro leftward rotation and
 associated with moderate this the rightward convex scoliosis but allowing for
 those factors, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within
 normal range.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A geographic I
 density is probably pleural but laced along the lateral right hemithorax may
 be a manifestation of scarring or small loculated pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Pleural-based density which
 should be evaluated with chest CT when clinically appropriate less prior
 studies are available to show long-term stability.  Comparison from ___ is still pending, however.  CHECK PRIORS
