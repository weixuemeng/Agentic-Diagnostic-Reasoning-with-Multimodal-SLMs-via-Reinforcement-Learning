 enlarged.  Large lung volumes suggest COPD, but the pulmonary vasculature is
 substantially engorged.  Neither the extensive asbestos-related pleural plaque
 nor the large right intraatrial mass or thrombus seen on the chest CT ___ is evident, although the course of the right ventricular pacer defibrillator
 lead suggests displacement by that atrial filling defect.
 
 Extensive blastic metastases are noted in the chest cage, reflecting
 metastatic prostate carcinoma.
