                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  chest pain, shortness of breath// Eval for
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Enlargement
 of the hila appears similar with mild pulmonary vascular congestion re-
 demonstrated.  Previously noted right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on
 chest CT is not well assessed on the current radiograph.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded in the
 left lower lobe in the correct clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.  An electronic device projects over the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacities within the lung bases likely reflects atelectasis.
