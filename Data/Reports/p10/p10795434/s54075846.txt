                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with possible seizure.  Assess for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly hypoinflated lungs with persistent bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
 These plaques obscure visualization of the lung parenchyma particularly at the
 bases.  No new focal opacity. Right middle lobe opacity is stable from
 previous examinations.  Bibasilar fibrotic changes are noted. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mildly increased heart size. Tortuous aorta noted.
 Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable chest with mildly increased heart size.
 2.  Chronic fibrotic changes and calcified pleural plaques compatible with
 asbestosis exposure. Heavy calcified pleural plaques limits evaluation for
 small lesions or abnormalities.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis and fibrotic changes.
