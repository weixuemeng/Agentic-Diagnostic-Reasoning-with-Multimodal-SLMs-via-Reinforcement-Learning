                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bilateral
 pleural and diaphragmatic plaques are again seen, consistent with prior
 asbestos exposure.  Bibasilar reticular opacities left greater than right may
 have slightly increased in the interval, consistent with fibrotic interstitial
 disease.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The hilar contours are stable.  The aorta remains
 calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 2.  Bilateral pleural and diaphragmatic plaques again seen consistent with
 prior asbestos exposure.  Bibasilar reticular opacities again seen consistent
 with a fibrotic interstitial lung disease are better evaluated on CT.
