                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure-like activity assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Bilateral
 calcified pleural plaques and basilar reticular opacities, consistent with
 known fibrotic changes related to asbestosis, are re- demonstrated without new
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The heart is stably enlarged with tortuous and calcified intrathoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: Chronic fibrotic changes and calcified pleural plaques compatible
 with asbestos exposure without acute intrathoracic process.
