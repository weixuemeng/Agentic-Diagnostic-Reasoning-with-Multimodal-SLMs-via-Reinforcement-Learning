  1.  No displaced rib fractures.
  2. Lower lung fibrosis with superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia or
  aspiration pneumonia. Differential includes large pulmonary contusion or
  hemorrhage given history of trauma.
  3. Widened mediastinum is most likely accentuated due to patient positioning
  however findings can be seen with aortic dissection/aortic injury post trauma.
  Consider upright radiograph to allow for direct comparison.
  4. Calcified pleural plaques.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest trauma.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Calcified pleural plaques are again noted.  Lower lung fibrosis accounts for
 the opacity in the lung bases bilaterally, however the retrocardiac and left
 lower lobe opacity has increased since prior examination worrisome for
 superimposed pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 new mild widening of the mediastinum, measuring 7.7 cm, likely accentuated due
 to supine positioning.  Heart size, and hila are grossly unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Visualized osseous
 structures are grossly unremarkable.  No displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No displaced rib fractures.
 2.  Lower lung fibrosis with superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia or
 aspiration pneumonia.  Differential includes large pulmonary contusion or
 hemorrhage given history of trauma.
 3.  Widened mediastinum is most likely accentuated due to patient positioning
 however findings can be seen with aortic dissection/aortic injury post trauma.
 Consider upright radiograph to allow for direct comparison.
 4.  Calcified pleural plaques.
