                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Extensive mucous plugging seen on CT chest 
 // interval change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again an area of increased
 opacification at the right base medially which could reflect postobstructive
 atelectasis related to mucous plugging. Otherwise, the cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits and there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 Of incidental note are several flecks of opacification adjacent to the greater
 tuberosity of the right humerus, consistent with calcific tendinosis in the
 rotator cuff. There is also an impression on the lower cervical trachea on the
 right, which could represent enlargement of the thyroid.
