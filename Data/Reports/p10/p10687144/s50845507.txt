                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia, in a patient with a headache.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding,
 specifically in both lower lobes.  No definite consolidation identified. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  Visualized bones are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are low with resultant exaggeration of bronchovascular
 markings in both lower lobes.  Linear left retrocardiac opacities likely
 represent exaggerated vascular markings related to low lung volumes or linear
 atelectasis than consolidation.  No pleural effusion present.
