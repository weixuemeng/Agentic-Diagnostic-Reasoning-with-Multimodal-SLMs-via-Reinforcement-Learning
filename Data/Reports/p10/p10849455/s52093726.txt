                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 well expanded and grossly clear.  Bronchial wall thickening is present in the
 lower lobes, best visualized on the lateral view in the infrahilar region. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchial wall thickening, which may reflect acute bronchitis
 given recent history of cough.  No focal consolidation to suggest the presence
 of pneumonia.
