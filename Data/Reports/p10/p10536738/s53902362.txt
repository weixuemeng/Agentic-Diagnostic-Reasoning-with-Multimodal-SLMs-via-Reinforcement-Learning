 limits.  The trachea is deviated to the right at the thoracic inlet compatible
 with enlarged left lobe of the thyroid seen on prior CT scan.  Lower thoracic

 lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal vertebrae are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
