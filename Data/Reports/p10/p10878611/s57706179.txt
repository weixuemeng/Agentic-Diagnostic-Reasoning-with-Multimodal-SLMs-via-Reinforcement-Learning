                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.   
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild right base atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta appears tortuous.  There is
 slight prominence of the ascending aorta which could be due to tortuosity,
 although underlying dilatation of the ascending aorta is not excluded.  This
 finding could be further evaluated with non-urgent chest CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild right base atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.  Slight prominence of the ascending aorta could be due to
 tortuosity versus dilatation of the ascending aorta which could be further
 evaluated with a chest CTA.
