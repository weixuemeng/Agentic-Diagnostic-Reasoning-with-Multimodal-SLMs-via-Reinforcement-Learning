                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever at nursing home.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and from ___.  There is subtle opacity in the
 retrocardiac space which may localize to left lower lobe on the frontal exam. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear without effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Dual-lead pacing device is seen with lead tips to
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Hypertrophic changes seen in the spine
 as well as mild wedge deformity of the lower thoracic vertebral body,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the retrocardiac region likely on the left,
 which could represent atelectasis; however, infiltrate is not completely
 excluded and correlation should be made clinically.
