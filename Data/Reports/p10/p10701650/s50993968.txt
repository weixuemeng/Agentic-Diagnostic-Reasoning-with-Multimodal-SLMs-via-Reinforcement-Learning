                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Upper respiratory tract symptoms, retrocardiac opacity seen
 on prior chest x-ray, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST:  Cardiac size is within normal limits.  Dual-chamber pacemaker is
 present.
 
 The lung fields are clear.  The density seen on the prior lateral film in
 ___ is now no longer present and likely represented therefore either
 overlying vascular shadows or atelectasis which has since resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lung clear.  No evidence of pneumonia.
