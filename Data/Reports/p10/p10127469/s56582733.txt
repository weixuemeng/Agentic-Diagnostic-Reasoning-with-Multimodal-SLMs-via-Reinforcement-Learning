                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sepsis; line comfirmation  // L CVL placement;
 infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left sided Port-A-Cath tip projects just to the right of midline a over the
 expected region of the mid to upper SVC.  Left lower lobe dense consolidation
 is perhaps slightly more conspicuous particularly in the perihilar region
 compared to the prior exam - this likely reflects a combination of infection
 in the setting of sepsis, atelectasis, as well as a small pleural effusion. 
 New heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation is likely pneumonia.  Mild
 interstitial edema is improved since ___.  Probable mild cardiomegaly
 is overall similar.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Catheter tip projects over the expected region of the mid to upper SVC.
 2.  Bibasilar pneumonia increased since ___.
 3.  Persistent small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 4.  Mild interstitial edema, improved.
