                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent admission for symptomatic pleural
 effusion, pneumonia, presents with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to determine given the presence of
 moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions.  Mediastinal contours are
 grossly unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar airspace
 opacities, potentially atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
