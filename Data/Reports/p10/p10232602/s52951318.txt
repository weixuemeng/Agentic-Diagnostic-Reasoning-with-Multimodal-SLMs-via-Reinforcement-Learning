                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Apparent hazy
 opacification within the right lung base is likely due to pectus excavatum
 deformity, and no consolidative opacity is seen on the lateral view.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
