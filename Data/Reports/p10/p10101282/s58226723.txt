                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with HIV, presenting for evaluation of chest
 pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  2 poorly defined peripheral opacities are present in
 the periphery of the right mid lung and left lung base, for which further
 evaluation with CT is recommended.  Small right pleural effusion is again
 noted.  No pleural effusion on the left.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  Tip of the left Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Ill-defined opacities in the right mid lung and left lung base, for which
 further evaluation with CT is recommended.  Diagnostic considerations include
 multifocal infection (including septic emboli and fungal organisms), bland
 infarcts, and vasculitis.  Neoplasm is considered less likely but is not
 excluded radiographically.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT.
