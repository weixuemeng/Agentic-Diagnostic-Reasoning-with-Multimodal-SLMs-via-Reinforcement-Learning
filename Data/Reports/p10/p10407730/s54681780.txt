                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post non-ST elevation MI and pulmonary edema
 with persistent productive cough and exertional shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 right-sided pacer device is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Pulmonary edema persists,
 although appears somewhat improved since the prior study.  There are likely
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly less
 prominent which may be due to differences in technique and patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate interstitial edema, decreased since the prior study. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
