                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and productive cough  // ? process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided large-bore central venous catheter is again seen terminating in
 the right atrium. Dual lead right-sided pacemaker is stable in position. There
 is persistent blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggesting trace
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Perihilar opacities are
 consistent with pulmonary edema which appear grossly stable to possibly
 minimally decreased as compared to the prior study. The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions again seen.  Pulmonary edema which may be
 slightly improved since the prior study. Persistent cardiomegaly.
