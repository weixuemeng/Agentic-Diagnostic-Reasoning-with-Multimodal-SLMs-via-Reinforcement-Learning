                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Flash pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is
 continued and probably worsening pulmonary edema, consistent with clinical
 history.  The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, suggesting some pleural fluid
 and volume loss on this side.  Pacer leads are in satisfactory position in
 this patient with previous CABG procedure and intact midline sternal wires.
