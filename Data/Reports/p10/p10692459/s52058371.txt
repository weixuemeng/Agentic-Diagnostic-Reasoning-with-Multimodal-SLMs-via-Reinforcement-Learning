                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dizziness, fall, weakness
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Overlying EKG leads are present.
 Kyphotic angulation of the spine is centered at the thoracolumbar junction at
 the site of an apparent thoracic vertebral body compression deformity. Lower
 lung streaky opacities likely represent atelectasis and scarring. No focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia. No effusion or pneumothorax. No overt
 edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony demineralization
 is noted diffusely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower thoracic compression deformity partially imaged with associated kyphotic
 angulation of the chest. Streaky opacities at the lower lungs likely
 atelectasis/ scarring.
