                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ? PNA  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear areas of atelectasis/ scarring are seen in the right mid lung and
 lateral left lung base. Patchy opacity seen posteriorly on the lateral view
 may be due to atelectasis and overlap of vascular structures although
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable. There appears to be partially imaged chronic deformity at the
 proximal left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity seen posteriorly on the lateral view may be due to atelectasis
 and overlap of vascular structures although infectious process is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Scattered areas of atelectasis/
 scarring.
