                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain, dyspnea and cough status post trauma, here
 to evaluate for rib fracture or pneumothorax. 
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate-sized right pneumothorax without significant tension
 component  Streaky opacification of the right lung base most likely reflects
 bronchovascular crowding and associated collapse of the lung.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present on the right greater than the left. The lungs
 are hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragm compatible with COPD.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There are
 minimally displaced fractures of the ___ anterolateral, ___ posterolateral,
 and ___ anterolateral ribs.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate-sized right pneumothorax with no significant tension component. 
 
 2. Minimally displaced right sided rib fractures of the ___ anterolateral, ___
 posterolateral, and ___ anterolateral ribs. 
 
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left. 
 
 4. Findings consistent with underlying COPD.
