                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New AFib, rule out pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the current image is
 rotated to the left.  As a consequence, the right hemithorax appears bigger
 than previously.  However, no abnormal contours are noted.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No evidence of
 pneumonia, larger pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.  Vertebral fixation
 devices are in constant position.
