                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe consolidation, to compare for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the chest radiograph of ___, there is some
 increasing opacification at the left base with slightly less opacification in
 the right.  Although much of this probably represents atelectasis, there is a
 more consolidative aspect, consistent with the left lower lobe pneumonia seen
 on the CT examination of ___.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
