                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post fall with right-sided
 pneumothorax, recent removal of right-sided pigtail catheter, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 semi-upright position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is
 made with the next preceding similar chest examination of ___.
 
 The pigtail and right-sided pleural drainage catheter had been removed already
 prior to the preceding examination of ___.  Consequently status of patient
 is unchanged during the latest one-day examination interval.  Again, there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  No new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen and the bilateral basal linear densities representing
 atelectasis remain rather unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.
