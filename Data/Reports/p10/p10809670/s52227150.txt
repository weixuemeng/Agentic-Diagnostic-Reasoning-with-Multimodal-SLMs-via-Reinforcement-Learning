                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of bilateral lower
 extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relatively
 low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this, no
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable
 given low lung volumes.  There may be very minimal central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, although the pulmonary markings are likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  Minimal mid lung atelectasis is seen.
