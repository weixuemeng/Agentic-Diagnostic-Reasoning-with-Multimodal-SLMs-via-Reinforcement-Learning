                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are relatively low lung volumes which
 may accentuate the prominent transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No convincing evidence of acute
 pneumonia, though there are some atelectatic changes at the left base.
