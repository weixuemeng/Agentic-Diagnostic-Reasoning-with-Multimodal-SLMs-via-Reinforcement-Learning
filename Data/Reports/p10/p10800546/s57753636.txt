                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and leukocytosis, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Substantial increase in size of the right hilus, right paratracheal tissue to
 the tracheobronchial angle and the mediastinum in the region of the AP window
 could be due to new adenopathy or progressive pulmonary hypertension. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly worse and there is new small pleural
 effusion on the left side.  There are no lung findings to suggest pneumonia,
 but there may be several new small nodules in the left mid lung.
 
 CT scanning, even without contrast agent would be helpful in clarifying these
 new developments. Dr. ___ and I discussed these findings, one minute
 after paging him at 1:01 p.m., one minute after recognition.
