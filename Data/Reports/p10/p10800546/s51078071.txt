                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There are bibasilar opacities which most
 likely relate to atelectasis, underlying aspiration may be present.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  There is mild anterolisthesis of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body and over the vertebral bodies inferior to it.  Surgical clips
 in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Flattening of the diaphragms suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.
 2.  Mild bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis or mild aspiration.
