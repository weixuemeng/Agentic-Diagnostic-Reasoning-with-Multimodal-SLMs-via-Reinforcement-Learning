                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with elevated troponins and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to study performed
 at ___ from earlier the same day.  There has been interval development of
 indistinct pulmonary vascular markings.  Small- to moderate-sized bilateral
 pleural effusions are more clearly delineated on the current exam.  The lung
 volumes are seen.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent, likely accentuated due to
 AP technique and low inspiratory effort.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure and moderate bilateral
 effusions.
