  1. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.
  2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with mild associated pulmonary
  interstitial edema.
  3. Asymmetric density in the right lung base may represent edema, atelectasis,
  or pneumonia, depending on the clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough 9 days, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 SEVERE CARDIOMEGALY AND PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION ARE CHRONIC.  MILD
 INTERSTITIAL EDEMA AND SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION ARE NEW SINCE ___.  Median sternotomy wires, a prosthetic valve, and mediastinal clips
 project in unchanged location.  There is no pneumothorax.  SMALL INDENTATION
 ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRACHEA AT THE THORACIC INLET IS MOST COMMONLY DUE TO
 A LARGE LEFT THYROID LOBE
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NEW MILD PULMONARY EDEMA AND SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION.  CHRONIC SEVERE
 CARDIOMEGALY AND PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION.
 
 
 
 2. POSSIBLE ENLARGED LEFT THYROID.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   CLINICAL EVALUATION FOR POSSIBLE GOITER.
