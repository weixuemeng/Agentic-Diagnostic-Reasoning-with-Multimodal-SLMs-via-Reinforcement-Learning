                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. The patient is status post
 median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, and CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is present. There is a moderate size hiatal hernia. Lung volumes are low which
 causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Mild pulmonary edema is
 present along with small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. There are multilevel
 degenerative changes with bridging anterior osteophytes compatible with DISH.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions and mild
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.
