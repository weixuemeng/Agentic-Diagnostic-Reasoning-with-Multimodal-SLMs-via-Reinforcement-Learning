 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings may reflect interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Left-sided perihilar opacity is incompletely evaluated on this study, and
 may represent pneumonia, hilar lymphadenopathy, or lung parenchyma lesion.  CT
 of the chest with contrast could be performed for further evaluation.  At the
