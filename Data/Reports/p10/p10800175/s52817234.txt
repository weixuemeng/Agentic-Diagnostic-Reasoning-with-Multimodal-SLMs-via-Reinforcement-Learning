                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with severe resp distress  // Eval for acute infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Right basilar opacity is compatible with right lower
 lobe atelectasis and small effusion.  Spiculated left lower lung mass is again
 noted. Right apical nodular density is also as on prior. The lungs are
 otherwise clear without new focal consolidation.  Skin fold projects over the
 left lateral thoracic cavity mimicking a pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Calcific
 density inferior to the left glenohumeral joint suggests intra-articular body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
