                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest is provided.  Elevation is
 limited due to underpenetrated technique, though the possibility of pulmonary
 edema is impossible to exclude given the diffuse increased opacity within the
 lungs.  Evaluation for underlying pneumonia is limited.  No acute bony
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study with possible pulmonary edema.  Please note
 evaluation markedly limited to underpenetrated technique and large body
 habitus.
