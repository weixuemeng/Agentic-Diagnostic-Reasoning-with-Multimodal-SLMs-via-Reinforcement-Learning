                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Apparent area of homogeneous opacity has developed at
 the right lung base, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.  This could
 represent a right pleural effusion with or without adjacent atelectasis or
 consolidation.  When the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral
 radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region.
