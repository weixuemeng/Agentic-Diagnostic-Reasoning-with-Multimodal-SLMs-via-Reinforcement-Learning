                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse increased attenuation of the
 lungs is partially secondary to soft tissue attenuation.  Compared to the
 portable chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval
 development of mild pulmonary edema.  The tip of a right PICC is indistinct,
 though no lower than the mid SVC.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is increased opacification of the left lung base as compared
 to prior exam from ___ which could reflect worsening
 atelectasis, or possibly pneumonia or aspiration.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are possible but difficult to assess given diffuse
 basilar densities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Recurrence of mild pulmonary edema with possible bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 2.  Increased retrocardiac density possible worsening atelectasis though
 pneumonia aspiration should be considered.
