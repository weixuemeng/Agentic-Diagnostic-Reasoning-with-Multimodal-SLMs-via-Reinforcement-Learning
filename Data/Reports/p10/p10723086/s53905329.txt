                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with choriocarcinoma receiving tube feedings.
 Evaluate for evidence of aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 A tracheostomy tube sits at the level of the clavicles. A right IJ central
 line terminates in the SVC. Evaluation of the lungs is somewhat limited by low
 lung volumes and motion artifact. However, bilateral airspace opacities have
 decreased since the study of 5 days ago. Left lung nodules are again noted.
 Persistent opacification of the retrocardiac region is likely due to
 atelectasis. There are likely small layering bilateral pleural effusions. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is magnified by the projection. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving airspace opacities which may be due it resolving edema versus
 aspiration.
 Right IJ central line remains in satisfactory position.
