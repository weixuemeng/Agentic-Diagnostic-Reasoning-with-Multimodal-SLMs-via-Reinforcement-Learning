                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with morbid obesity, OSA, asthma, hypertension,
 chronic lymphedema, and history of prior ectopic pregnancy with recent
 hospitalization for LLE cellulitis and pneumonia who presented to the ED for
 increased dyspnea, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, found to
 have choriocarcinoma, presumed metastatic to lungs, receiving chemotherapy and
 renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure who remains intubated ___
 metastatic disease to lungs  // Please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Technically extremely limited image.  Only the right hemi thorax and parts of
 the left medial hemi thorax are shown.  Better visible than on the previous
 image are multiple rounded opacities of soft tissue density, located in the
 right lung, and suggesting the presence of metastatic disease.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic sinus could suggest the presence of a minimal right
 pleural effusion.  The patient is intubated and the visible parts of the
 support devices are in correct position.  The heart is not entirely visible. 
 No evidence of a right pneumothorax.
