                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with choriocarcinoma and respiratory
 failure.  Extubated and then reintubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 5:18 a.m.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is at the level of the clavicular
 heads.  There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally. 
 Evaluation for pneumothorax is very limited; however, no large pneumothoraces
 are seen.  There is cardiomegaly and a left retrocardiac opacity.  The enteric
 tube is not well seen due to technique and the patient's body habitus.
