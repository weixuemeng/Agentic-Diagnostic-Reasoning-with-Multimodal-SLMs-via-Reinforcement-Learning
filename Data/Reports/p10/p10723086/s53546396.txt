                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NG tube  // NG past carina?      NG past
 carina?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison a prior study ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The feeding tube has its tip coursing within the airway and terminates in the
 left lower lobe bronchus.  Repositioning was recommended by Dr. ___ as
 documented in the wet reading.  The tracheostomy tube and right internal
 jugular central line appear unchanged position given the marked differences in
 positioning between studies.
 
 There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with known
 metastatic disease which makes it challenging to assess for superimposed
 edema.  The heart remains stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although a pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis ,although infection cannot be entirely
 excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.  No large pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
