                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Morbid obesity, shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable view of the chest was provided. 
 Evaluation is limited given the large body habitus and underpenetrated
 technique.  Allowing for this, the right lung appears clear.  The left lung
 base cannot be assessed.  The left upper lung appears well aerated.  The heart
 size appears enlarged, though this could be related to technique.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung base poorly assessed.  Possible cardiomegaly.  No
 definite signs of pneumonia in the right lung or left upper lung.
