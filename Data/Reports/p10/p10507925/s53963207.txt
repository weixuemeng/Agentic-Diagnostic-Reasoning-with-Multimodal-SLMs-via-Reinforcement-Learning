                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for signs of amiodarone toxicity in a patient with
 atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are no abnormal lung opacities to suggest amiodarone
 toxicity.  The vascular engorgement from ___ has resolved, and the
 lungs are clear.  A new bulge in the upper aspect of the left cardiac apex
 could be a ventricular aneurysm; however, there is no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation including pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal, and there is no pneumothorax. Old left rib
 fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of amiodarone toxicity.
 2.  Possible left ventricular aneurysm or worsening dilatation.  No evidence
 of cardiac decompensation (pulmonary edema, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusions).
