                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status,  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Patient's leftward rotation somewhat limits evaluation on the frontal
 projection.  The previously noted right upper extremity access PICC line is
 been removed.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contour
 appears grossly unremarkable.  Interstitial opacities noted bilaterally likely
 reflect interstitial pulmonary edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  On the lateral view, are multiple bilateral nodular opacities which may
 reflect on face vasculature.  A chronic left fifth rib deformity is new from
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, interstitial pulmonary edema.
