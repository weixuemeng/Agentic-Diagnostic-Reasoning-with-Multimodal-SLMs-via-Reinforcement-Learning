 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after transvenous pacemaker
 placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged.  There is mediastinal widening present
 as well as increase in size of the azygos vein consistent with chronic volume
 overload.  Currently, the perihilar opacities, upper zone re-distribution are
 consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in severity.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
