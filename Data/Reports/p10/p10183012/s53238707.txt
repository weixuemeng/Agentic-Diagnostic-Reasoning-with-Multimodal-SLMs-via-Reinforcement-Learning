                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST of ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is within normal limits.  Focal patchy opacity is present in the
 left retrocardiac region with otherwise clear lungs.  No pleural effusion. 
 Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
 2.  Patchy left lower lobe opacity, which may reflect patchy atelectasis,
 focal aspiration, and less likely an early infectious pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs would be helpful to assess for resolution.
