                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right upper quadrant pain, fever,
 status post cholecystectomy, question pneumonia, question free air.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 12:35 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacemaker again identified with multiple leads seen, many of
 which terminate over the expected location of the right atrium and two of the
 leads terminate over the expected location of the right ventricle.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in
 positioning and persistent low lung volumes.  Lungs demonstrate streaky
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis, but no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Linear opacity at the left base
 may represent scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or free
 air.  Calcifications in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
