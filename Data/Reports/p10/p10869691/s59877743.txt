                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy for mucous plug.  Presenting with
 elevated temperature.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 5:13 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.5 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A new enteric catheter courses below the level
 of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  There has been
 marked improvement in aeration of the left mid-to-lower lung, status post
 bronchoscopy with presumed removal of a mucous plug.  Moderate left lower
 lung/retrocardiac atelectasis persists.  Concomitant infection or re-expansion
 edema in this region is not excluded.  A small left pleural effusion may be
 present.  There may also be a tiny right pleural effusion, not significantly
 changed.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Marked interval improvement in aeration of the left mid-to-lower lung with
 moderate residual volume loss at the left lung base.  Given the persistent
 left lower lung opacities, infection or re-expansion edema in this region is
 not excluded.
 
 2.  Possible small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
