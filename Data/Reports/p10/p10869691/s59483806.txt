                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post trauma, evaluation for pulmonary edema or
 consolidations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows the
 hyperextended stomach.  The hyperextended stomach displaces the left
 hemidiaphragm upwards.  In addition, there is newly appeared left retrocardiac
 and left lower lobe atelectasis, combined to blunting of the left costophrenic
 sinus, potentially suggestive of mild left pleural effusion.
 
 The right lung bases also shows minimal basal atelectasis.  Otherwise, the
 lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 Left distal clavicular fracture with mild displacement is noted.
