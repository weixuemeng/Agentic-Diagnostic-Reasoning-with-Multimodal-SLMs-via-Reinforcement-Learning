                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Vomiting, pleuritic chest pain and cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovasculature in the lower left.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Increased opacities in the right middle
 lobe are likely atelectasis.  If clinically persistent concern, repeat
 radiograph with better inspiration is recommended for better assessment of the
 lung parenchyma.
