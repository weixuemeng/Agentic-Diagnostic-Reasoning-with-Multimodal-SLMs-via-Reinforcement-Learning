                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 5 cm from
 the carina.  Feeding tube passes off the inferior field of view.  Vague linear
 right basilar opacity is  most suggestive of atelectasis.  Elsewhere the lungs
 are grossly clear and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Likely chronic deformity of the lateral right clavicle.   Potentially
 acute deformity of the proximal left humerus is incompletely visualized. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Expected position of endotracheal tube.  Probable right basilar atelectasis. 
 Potentially acute deformity of the proximal left humerus is incompletely
 visualized.
