 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is within
 normal limits without appreciable vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia. Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. Mild blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions. There is asymmetry of
 the breast shadows, raising the possibility of previous partial right
 mastectomy.
