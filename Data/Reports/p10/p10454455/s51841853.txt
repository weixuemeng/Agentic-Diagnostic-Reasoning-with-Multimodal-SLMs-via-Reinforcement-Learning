                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ACUTE URI,COPD R/O PNEUMONIA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. However, no evidence of
 acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Suggestion of
 fibrocalcific changes in the left apex raises the possibility of old
 tuberculous disease.
