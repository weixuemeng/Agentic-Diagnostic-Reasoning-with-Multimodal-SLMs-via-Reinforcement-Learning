                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral thoracentesis done yesterday now
 with tachypnea and SOB.  // Evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary
 opacities with combined alveolar and interstitial features have progressed,
 with increased confluence at the lung bases.  Scattered cystic lucencies raise
 the possibility of underlying cavitary lesions, which could be confirmed or
 excluded by standard PA and lateral radiographs or CT scan when the patient's
 condition permits.  Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged as well as widespread sclerotic metastasis.
