                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusions  // please evaluate for
 size of effusions      please evaluate for size of effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Between ___, when the patient's chest radiograph showed multiple lung
 nodules and blastic bone lesions, and ___, the patient developed
 severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality accompanied by moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  This might have been due entirely to pulmonary edema from
 heart failure, but disseminated carcinoma could mimic this appearance.  The
 pulmonary process has progressed since ___, and the moderate pleural
 effusions are slightly larger, even though heart is normal size and there is
 no mediastinal vascular engorgement.  In addition there are small fluid-filled
 spaces in the lung which could be bullae filled with fluid or cavitated
 nodules either malignant or infectious.
 
 Blastic metastasis is widespread in the chest cage.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Left thoracentesis to determine if the pleural effusion is
 transudate, due to heart failure, or exudate, due to either infection or
 malignancy.
 
 Chest CT for further characterization of the lung abnormality, particularly
 possible cavities.
