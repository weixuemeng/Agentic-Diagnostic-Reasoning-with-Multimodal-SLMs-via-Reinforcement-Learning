                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p bilateral thoacentesis. Pain in left
 hemithorax  // r/o PTX left
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, decreased somewhat in size
 compared to the prior study.  Persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Reticular
 opacities throughout the lungs likely reflect interstitial edema with alveolar
 edema evident at the lung bases.  No pneumothorax seen.  The visualized bony
 structures demonstrate increased sclerosis consistent with metastatic disease.
 No free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax seen.
