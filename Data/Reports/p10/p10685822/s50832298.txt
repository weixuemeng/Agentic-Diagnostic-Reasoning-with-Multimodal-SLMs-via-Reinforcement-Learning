                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic prostate cancer with dyspnea on
 exertion and pleural effusions  // evaluate pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study with persistent
 moderate bibasal pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.  There are
 coarse interstitial markings bilaterally which may reflect interstitial
 pulmonary edema in this setting.  The patient's known pulmonary nodules are
 difficult to visualize on today's study.  The visualized bony structures the
 spine are densely sclerotic consistent with metastatic disease. Oral contrast
 material is noted in the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Coarse interstitial markings may reflect a degree of fluid overload.
