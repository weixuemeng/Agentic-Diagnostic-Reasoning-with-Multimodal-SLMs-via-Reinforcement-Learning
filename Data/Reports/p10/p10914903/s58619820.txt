  1. Mild pulmonary edema.
  2. New 6 mm rounded opacity at the right lung apex should be further evaluated
  with apical lordotic views.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Heart failure exacerbation, evaluate for progression of pulmonary
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema probably unchanged from ___.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are presumed.  Opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectasis,
 however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 structures are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 A 6 mm rounded opacity at the right lung apex may represent superimposition of
 soft tissues, however, was not present on the prior chest radiograph.  Further
 evaluation can be performed with apical lordotic views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.
 2. New 6 mm rounded opacity at the right lung apex should be further evaluated
 with apical lordotic views.
