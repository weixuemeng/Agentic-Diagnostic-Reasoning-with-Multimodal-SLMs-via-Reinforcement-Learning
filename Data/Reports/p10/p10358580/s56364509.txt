 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.3 cm above the carina.
 There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Size of the
 cardiac silhouette remains relatively large, pacemaker wires are in unchanged
 position.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia.
