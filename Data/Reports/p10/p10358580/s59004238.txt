                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in
 an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Slightly increased density at the lung basez is may represent vascular
 engorgement or atelectasis.  There is suggestion of increased density in the
 retrocardiac region, which also may be due to atelectasis.  Heart size is
 enlarged.  Aortic calcification is seen.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No
 frank pulmonary edema is detected but pulmonary vessels are engorged.  Small
 effusion may be present.  Dual-lead pacing hardware is noted.  Hardware
 projecting over the right subcutaneous tissues is likely external to the
 patient. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement.
