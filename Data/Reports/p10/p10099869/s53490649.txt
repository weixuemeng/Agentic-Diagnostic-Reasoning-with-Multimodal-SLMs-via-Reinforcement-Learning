                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pigtail placed for right pneumothorax, likely
 malpositioned in the liver.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 18:41 chest radiograph ___ at
 18:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided catheter with pigtail
 projecting over the liver.  A persistent moderate size right pneumothorax
 remains with continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures as seen on the
 chest CT scout.  Increased subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest
 wall is noted.  Streaky opacities are noted in the right lung likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Low lung volumes are present which results in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures and left basilar atelectasis.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours otherwise remain unchanged.  Right lateral rib
 fractures are better assessed on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided catheter with pigtail projecting over the
 liver.  Persistent moderate size right pneumothorax with continued mild
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Patchy atelectasis in both lungs. 
 Increased subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall.
