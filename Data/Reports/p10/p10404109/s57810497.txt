 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Little overall change in the appearance
 of the heart and lungs. The line projected over the outer portion of the right
 lung is not seen on the subsequent study dictated earlier, suggesting that it
 represents a skin fold.
