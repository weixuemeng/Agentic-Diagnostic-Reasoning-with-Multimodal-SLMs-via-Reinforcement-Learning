                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from bicycle, tenderness to palpation over the right
 shoulder, evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well-expanded
 lungs.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Tiny linear metallic density projecting
 over the right breast likely represents a biopsy clip. No definite rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. No displaced rib fractures seen based
 on this nondedicated examination.
