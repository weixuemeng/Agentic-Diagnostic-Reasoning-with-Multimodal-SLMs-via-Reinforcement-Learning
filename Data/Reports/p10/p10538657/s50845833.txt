                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back
 through the right atrium.  Chest tube remains in place, and there is no
 definite pneumothorax.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
