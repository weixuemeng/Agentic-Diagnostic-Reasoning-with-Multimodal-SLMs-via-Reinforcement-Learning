                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left sided pleuritic pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new opacity of the left lung base which may represent a combination
 of small pleural effusion and atelectasis however, an underlying infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is tortuosity of the descending aorta.
 Flattening of the diaphragms is consistent with chronic obstructive lung
 disease.  The right lung is essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is redemonstration of a compression deformity in the lower thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased left lung base opacity, may represent a combination of a
 small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  However, an underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
