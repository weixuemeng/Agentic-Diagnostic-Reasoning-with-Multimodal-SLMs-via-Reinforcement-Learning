                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure with shortness of breath and
 tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is moderate-to-severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette which appears relatively unchanged when compared to prior
 study.  Mild pulmonary edema is noted with vascular indistinctness and
 perihilar haziness.  Additionally, moderate right pleural effusion is
 demonstrated with associated right basilar opacity likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac region is likely
 present.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple old right-sided rib
 fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Persistent moderate right pleural effusion with right basilar opacity,
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  Minimal left basilar atelectasis is also
 noted.
