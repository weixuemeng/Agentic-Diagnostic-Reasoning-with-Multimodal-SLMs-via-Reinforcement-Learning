 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with acute onset left-sided chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, portable.  There is a small opacity overlying the left
 costophrenic sulcus, which may represent atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear and hyperinflated. Scarring in the lung apices is unchanged. Heart size
 is normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications in the aortic
 arch. Old right sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small opacity overlying the left costophrenic sulcus may
 represent atelectasis, however, early infectious process cannot be fully
 excluded.
