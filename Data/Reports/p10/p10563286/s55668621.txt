                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post fall evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is obscuration of the left hemi diaphragm, likely reflecting a
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is also atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  There is also a small right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Left chest AICD and leads are in
 appropriate position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Deformity of the posterior
 right eighth rib is identified reflecting prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely reflecting combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, although developing consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
 
 2.  Right lower lung atelectasis and small pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Prior right posterior eighth rib fracture.
