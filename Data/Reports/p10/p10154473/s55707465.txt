                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever post-operatively, intermittently
 hypoxic. Also with a history of diastolic CHF and ___ edema.  // PNA? Pulm
 edema? Other acute process?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, he cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary vascular congestion are again demonstrated.  A new rounded opacity
 in the left retrocardiac region is potentially due to focal atelectasis or
 developing consolidation, but short-term followup radiograph is recommended to
 exclude cavitary nodule such as septic embolism.
