                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hiccups and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior examination.  Heart size is
 accentuated as result, appearing mildly enlarged but similar to the previous
 examination.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures without
 overt pulmonary edema is present.  Linear and patchy opacities in the lung
 bases appear slightly worse in the interval, most likely reflective of
 worsening atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild hypertrophy changes are seen in the lower
 thoracic spine.  Fusion hardware within the lumbar spine is incompletely
 assessed.  A left PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes with increased patchy and linear opacities in the lung
 bases, likely worsening atelectasis.
