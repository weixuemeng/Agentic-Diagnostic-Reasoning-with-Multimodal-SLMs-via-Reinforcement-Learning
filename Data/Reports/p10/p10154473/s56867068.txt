                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with infected right index finger.  // pre-op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Hypertrophic changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
