 pneumonia, other explanation for tachycardia/confusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right PICC line again extends
 to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at
 the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 pleural fluid and volume loss in the right lower lung.  Less prominent
 atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
