                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p RUL and RLL wedge resection s/p CT removal 
 // please assess for pneumothorax      please assess for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been removal
 of the right chest tube with no definite pneumothorax. There are lower lung
 volumes with continued opacifications centrally involving much of the right
 lung.  This would be consistent with the previous suggestion of hematoma and
 anterior pneumatocele. Lateral view if clinically possible could be helpful.
