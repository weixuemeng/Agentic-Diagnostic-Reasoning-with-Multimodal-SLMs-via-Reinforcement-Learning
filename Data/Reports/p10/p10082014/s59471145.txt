 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new esophageal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 2 hr prior to this study.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New esophageal ube loops and ends within the thorax, likely within a large
 hiatal hernia. Otherwise there is no significant change compared with the

 sided IJ line ends in the upper to mid SVC. A right-sided PICC ends in the
 lower SVC.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No focal opacities concerning for
 pneumonia identified. No pleural effusion is identified. Previous right
 costophrenic angle vague opacity has cleared and it was most likely due to
 positioning. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.
