 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:38 PM
  Single portable AP view. Diffuse mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral effusions R>L
  and basilar atelectasis. More confluent opacification of the right base may be
  due to a combination of moderate effusion and compressive atelectasis;
  however, pneumonia could have a similar appearance and should be clinically
  correlated.
