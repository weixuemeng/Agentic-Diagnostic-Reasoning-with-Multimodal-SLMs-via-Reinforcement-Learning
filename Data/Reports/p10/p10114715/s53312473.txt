                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Epigastric chest pain with excessive burping.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is moderate
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  A small eventration is noted along the
 anterior right hemidiaphragm.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  There is no suggestion of hiatal hernia on these
 radiographs.  The bones are probably demineralized to some degree.  Mild
 degenerative changes involve the mid thoracic spine and left acromioclavicular
 joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Tortuous aorta, often seen in the
 setting of hypertension.  No evidence for hiatal hernia.
