                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough, shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slightly low
 lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings slightly at the
 lung bases.  Given this, there appears to be slight increase in opacity at the
 right lower lobe.  Underlying early/mild infectious process may be present. 
 Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
