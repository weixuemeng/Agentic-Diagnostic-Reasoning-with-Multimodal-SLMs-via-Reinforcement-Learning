                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post left IJ central line placement. 
 Evaluate line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The newly placed left internal jugular
 venous-approach catheter tip projects over the expected region of the low SVC.
 Lung volumes are slightly lower.  Left mid and lower lung parenchymal
 opacities persist, consistent with pneumonia with interval increase in opacity
 the lingula.  Right lower lobe infrahilar opacity persists and is more
 conspicuous, concern for aspiration and/or concurrent pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.  The
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Newly placed left IJ approach catheter tip projects over the expected
 region of the low SVC with the patient rotated.
 2.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities concerning for pneumonia, greater on the
 left are slightly worse from the earlier exam particularly in the right lower
 lobe and lingula.
