  1. Extensive left mid and lower lung airspace opacification most likely
  represents an acute pneumonia.
  2. Right lower lung airspace opacity may represent infection, aspiration, or
  atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, dyspnea, +D-Dimer, hypoxic, chest pain
 radiating to back, evaluate for PE or dissection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left mid and lower lung airspace opacity most likely represents acute
 pneumonia.  Ill-defined right lower lung airspace opacities may represent
 extension of the left-sided infectious process, aspiration, or atelectasis.  A
 right posterior seventh rib deformity is unchanged from ___.  An irregular
 contour of the medial left first rib is similar to the prior study.  Allowing
 for differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Extensive left mid and lower lung airspace opacification most likely
 represents an acute pneumonia.
 2. Right lower lung airspace opacity may represent infection, aspiration, or
 atelectasis.
