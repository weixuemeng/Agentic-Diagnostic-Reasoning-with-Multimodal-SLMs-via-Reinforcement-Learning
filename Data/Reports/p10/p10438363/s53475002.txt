                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachypnea // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lung volumes contribute to bibasilar atelectasis as well as vascular
 crowding. Whether component of pulmonary edema exists are not is difficult to
 ascertain given the low lung volumes.  No focal opacities.  No pneumothorax. 
 No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes contributing to bibasal atelectasis and vascular crowding.
 Consider repeat radiograph with full inspiration to rule out pulmonary edema.
