                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:41
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bifrontal glioblastoma and seizures
 with possible UTI, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 AP portable supine chest film, ___ at 11:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place with tip in the distal SVC.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Linear opacity at the left
 base most likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No focal
 airspace consolidation seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
