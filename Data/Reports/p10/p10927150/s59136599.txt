                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain and bloating, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast dated ___.  Chest radiograph
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with evidence of COPD.  Multiple focal
 airspace opacities throughout both lungs with predominance in the bilateral
 bases are compatible with known pulmonary metastases seen on the prior CT of
 ___.  Opacification at the left lower lobe may correspond to a known
 pulmonary nodule; however, focal consolidation or pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged.  There is
 calcification at the aortic knob.  A right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium.  The trachea
 is midline.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  Focal
 airspace opacity in the left lower lobe may represent one of the patient's
 multiple known pulmonary metastases.  No definite consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia is detected, however, difficult to exclude in this setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Multiple faint focal airspace opacities likely correspond to known
 pulmonary metastases.
 2. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.
