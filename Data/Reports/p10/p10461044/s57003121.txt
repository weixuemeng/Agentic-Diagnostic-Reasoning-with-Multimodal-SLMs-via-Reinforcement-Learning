                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB and cough  // infiltrate.  Patient has history of
 lung cancer, per the electronic medical record.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New compared to prior bilateral hazy perihilar opacities.  Better seen on the
 lateral view is a focal rounded opacity projecting posteriorly, overlying the
 lower lobes, likely localizing to the right on the frontal view. Additional
 nodular opacity projects over the anterior right third rib laterally, new
 since prior.  It is uncertain if this is due to rib changes or underlying
 parenchymal abnormality.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires
 are intact.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities new since prior potentially due to edema,
 infection and/or malignancy in light of patient's history.
 More focal opacity projecting over the lower lobes on the lateral view, likely
 on the right based on the frontal which could correlate with known malignancy.
 Additional opacity projecting over the anterior right third rib could be due
 to rib changes or underlying parenchymal abnormality.
 
 Correlation with cross-sectional imaging, presumably performed elsewhere is
 suggested for further characterization of these findings.  Otherwise,
 additional cross-sectional imaging will be necessary.
