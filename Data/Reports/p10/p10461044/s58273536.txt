                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 Multiple intact sternal wires and numerous mediastinal clips denote recent
 cardiac history.  The right IJ central venous catheter has been removed. 
 There has been interval resolution of previously seen pulmonary edema.  A
 trace right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are decreased. 
 The lung volumes have improved, resulting in decreased bibasilar atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolved pulmonary edema.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Improved atelectasis in the setting of increased lung volumes.
