                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p CABG who was being treated in MICU for syncope and UTI
 who was then found to have free air and taken to the operating room.  // post
 op     post op
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 14:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 23:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval intubation with endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4.5 cm
 above the carina. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below
 the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The left internal jugular central
 line is unchanged in position with its tip in the proximal SVC.  Status post
 median sternotomy with stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 Increased lucency overlying the right hemidiaphragm likely related to recent
 exploratory surgery in this patient with known free intraperitoneal air as
 documented on a lateral decubitus abdominal study dated ___ at
 15:25.  Increasing perihilar fullness which may reflect a fluid replete state,
 as there is no overt pulmonary edema. Increasing opacity in the retrocardiac
 region likely reflects increasing atelectasis, although superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded. Possible layering left effusion.
