                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with likely pna  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the study of ___, there is improvement in bilateral
 upper lobe vascular congestion.  The large bilateral pleural effusions with
 superimposed atelectasis or collapse of the lower lobes are unchanged. The
 persistence of multifocal airspace opacities is suspicious for ARDS, and
 clinical correlation is recommended. Heart size is top-normal. The left IJ CVC
 ends at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic and the SVC. The
 endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in bilateral upper lobe vascular congestion.
 2. Unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe
 collapse.
 3. Persistent multifocal airspace opacities suspicious for ARDS, clinical
 correlation recommended.
