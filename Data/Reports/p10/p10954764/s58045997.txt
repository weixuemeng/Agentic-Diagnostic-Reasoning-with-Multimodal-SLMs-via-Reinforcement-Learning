                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with b/l pleural effusions, intubated  // change
 in effusions, ett location
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right internal jugular vascular catheter, terminating in
 the proximal superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. COMPARISON of
 pleural effusions is limited due to positional differences between the exams,
 but a moderate right pleural effusion appears relatively similar, or as a
 moderate left pleural effusion has apparently slightly decreased in size in
 the interval.  Adjacent bibasilar atelectasis and or consolidation is similar
 to the prior exam.
