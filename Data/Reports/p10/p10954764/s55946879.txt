 Please evaluate for interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following bronchoscopy
 there has been re-expansion of much of the left lung. Opacification at the
 base is consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and volume loss
 in the left lower lung.  There is now an endotracheal tube in place with its
 tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Central catheter is unchanged. Right
 basilar opacification is consistent with effusion and atelectasis. In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
