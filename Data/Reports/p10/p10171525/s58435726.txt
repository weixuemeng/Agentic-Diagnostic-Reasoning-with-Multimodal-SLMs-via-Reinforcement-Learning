                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.6 cm from the carina.  Heart
 size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary edema is seen.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  Aspiration or infection, however, cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
