                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p stab x2, bilateral chest tubes, L
 diaphragm repair, R thorocotomy  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral chest drains in-situ.  These are unchanged in position
 when compared to the prior study.  The side hole of the right-sided chest
 strain is close to the chest wall but appears to be within the pleural space. 
 Small amount subcutaneous emphysema has decreased when compared to the prior
 study.  Lung volumes remain low.  No pneumothorax seen.  Apparent widening of
 the cardiomediastinal contour is likely due to the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  The
 right-sided chest tube is close to the chest wall but appears to be within the
 pleural space.
