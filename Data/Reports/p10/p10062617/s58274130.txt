                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with a left ventricular predominance is again seen.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Previous pattern of pulmonary edema has resolved.  Minimal
 linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There has also
 been near complete resolution of the previously noted small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine with mild loss of height of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body anteriorly, which is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence
 for congestive heart failure.
