                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia and congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low which causes
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is a left retrocardiac
 opacity which may represent atelectasis or infection.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild pulmonary edema appears
 relatively unchanged since ___.  Cardiomegaly and calcification
 of the aortic knob is also relatively unchanged.  A pacer with leads in the
 right atrium and right ventricle is redemonstrated.  There is no free air
 beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity is incompletely assessed and could represent
 atelectasis and or pneumonia. Please refer to subsequent CTA chest results for
 further details.
