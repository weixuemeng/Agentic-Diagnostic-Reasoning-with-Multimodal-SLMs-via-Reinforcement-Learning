                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Atypical left chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___, when the patient
 had large left lower lobe pneumonia.  Today, the lungs are fully expanded,
 cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.  I do
 not see any chest cage abnormality, but this study is not designed for
 detection of subtle rib lesions.  If there are focal findings, then detailed
 views of those areas should be obtained.
