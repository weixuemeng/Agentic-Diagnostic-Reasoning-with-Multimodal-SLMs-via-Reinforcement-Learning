                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, recent bacteremia/cholecystitis  //
 eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There is increased retrocardiac
 density, which may be artifactual.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  There is a
 small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased retrocardiac density, which is likely artifactual due to poor
 inspiration and decreased penetration, considering there is also increased
 density overlying the vertebrae.  However, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Small right pleural effusion.
