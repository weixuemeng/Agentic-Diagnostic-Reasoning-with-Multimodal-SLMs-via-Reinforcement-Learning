                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker leads
 terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle and are in unchanged
 positions.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette size is stable. 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left, which is
 relatively unchanged, and small-to-moderate on the right, which appears
 increased when compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect atelectasis, but infection in these regions cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax is present. No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate-sized left, and increasing small-to-moderate
 right pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung
 bases is not excluded.
