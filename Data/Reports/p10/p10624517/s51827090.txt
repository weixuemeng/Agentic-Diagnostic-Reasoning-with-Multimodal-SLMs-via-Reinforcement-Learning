  Intestinal catheter traverses below the diaphragm with tip out of view.
  Otherwise similar exam with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
  Endotracheal tube and right sided central catheter in similar positions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 17:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with volume overload and atrial
 fibrillation, evaluate nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison made to ___ at 13:04.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ 17:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the sacrum.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip
 in the distal SVC.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 3.5 cm above
 the carina.
 
 2.  Stable bilateral moderate layering pleural effusions with perihilar
 airspace opacity likely reflecting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema which is
 essentially unchanged.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in positioning and technique between studies.
 
 3.  Clips in the right upper quadrant likely reflect prior cholecystectomy. 
 Surgical clips are seen overlying the sacrum of uncertain significance. 
 Scattered areas seen in non-dilated loops of bowel.
