                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shock with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is decreased opacification at the right base,
 consistent with some decrease in pleural effusion.  However, some of this
 could reflect the more erect posture of the patient.  Opacification at the
 left base persists, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and a moderate effusion.
