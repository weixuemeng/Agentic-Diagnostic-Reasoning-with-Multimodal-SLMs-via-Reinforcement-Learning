  Evaluation is limited due to rotation; however, retraction of the right
  internal jugular catheter by 4.5 cm is recommended. Bilateral effusions, mild
  on the right and moderate on the left, with adjacent atelectasis are again
  noted. Retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity is likely a combination of
  atelectasis and effusion. However, pneumonia must be excluded in the proper
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy, for central line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change in the appearance of the right IJ catheter, which still extends into
 the right atrium and could be pulled back approximately 4-5 cm.  Opacification
 at the left base is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  Pulmonary vessels are less well defined,
 suggesting some increasing pulmonary venous congestion.
 
 Continued apical pleural capping on the right, and to a lesser degree, on the
 left, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
