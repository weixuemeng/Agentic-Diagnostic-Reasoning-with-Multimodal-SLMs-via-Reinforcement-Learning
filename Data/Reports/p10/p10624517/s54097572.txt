                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the ET tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on
 ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Right internal jugular line is at the proximal right atrium, unchanged.  There
 is slightly improved aeration of the left, most likely related with beginning
 of the mechanical ventilation.  Pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions,
 and bibasal atelectasis are redemonstrated.  No clear evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.
