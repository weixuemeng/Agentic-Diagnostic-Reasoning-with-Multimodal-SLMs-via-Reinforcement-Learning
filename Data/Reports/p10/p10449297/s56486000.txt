                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appears
 similar.  Cardiomegaly is again noted.  Minimal linear left basilar opacity
 appears similar and likely represents atelectasis.  Of note, evaluation is
 slightly limited in the absence of lateral view.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen on this single view.  No focal consolidation is seen on
 this single view.  Aortic calcifications are again noted.
 
 Radiopaque material in the left abdomen may represent previously ingested oral
 contrast.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable frontal chest radiograph.  Limited evaluation in the
 setting of single frontal view; lateral view would be helpful for more
 thorough evaluation.  This was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone
 at 12:45 p.m. on ___.
