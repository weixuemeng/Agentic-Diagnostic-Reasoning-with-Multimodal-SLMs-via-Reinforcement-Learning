                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of left rib injury  // ?acute
 process      ?acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum, and pleural surfaces.  No evidence of
 intrathoracic malignancy or infection, including tuberculosis.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is
 clinically warranted, the location where there are focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
