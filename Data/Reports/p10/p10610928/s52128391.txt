                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of respiratory distress following renal transplant,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities with some
 improvement in aeration of the right lung compared to the prior exam. 
 Although this may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  A right internal jugular central line terminates at the mid SVC. 
 The heart remains severely enlarged.  The left pleural effusion has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistant bilateral pulmonary opacities with improved aeration in the
 right lower lobe. This may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema; however,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Resolution of the left pleural effusion.
