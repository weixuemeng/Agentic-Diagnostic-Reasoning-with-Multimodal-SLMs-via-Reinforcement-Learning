                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with new feeding tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new bibasilar opacities which likely reflect atelectasis,
 though superimposed aspiration might also have this appearance in this
 gentleman who presented with seizure.  Bilateral apical opacities are new from
 prior and may reflect developing apical pulmonary edema, possibly from a
 neurogenic cause.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 An NG tube is in place, the tip is in the stomach with sidehole in the distal
 esophagus, this may be advanced several centimeters for more optimal
 positioning.  The ET tube tip is positioned ~ 6 cm above the level of the
 carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis with possible aspiration in this patient with
 seizure.
 
 2.  Developing apical opacities which may reflect developing neurogenic
 pulmonary edema, recommend attention on followup.
