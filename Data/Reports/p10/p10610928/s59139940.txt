                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, now with rales on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable chest the patient in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a right-sided internal jugular line seen terminating in the
 upper to mid SVC, unchanged in position and without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly with associated vascular congestion and
 unchanged mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial edema.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion noted.  A left-sided, retrocardiac opacification is once
 again identified, and may represent an effusion with adjacent atelectasis,
 although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with associated pulmonary interstitial
 edema.
 
 2. Unchanged appearance of a left sided retrocardiac opacification which
 silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm.  This likely represents an effusion within
 adjacent atelectasis, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be
 entirely excluded.
