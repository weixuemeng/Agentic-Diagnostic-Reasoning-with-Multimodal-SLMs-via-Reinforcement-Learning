                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and has increased in size from the
 previous study.  This may represent cardiomegaly with or without a component
 of pericardial effusion. Upper zone vascular redistribution is accompanied by
 asymmetrical mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema affecting the right lung to a
 greater degree than the left.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is new.
 Exclusion of the right lung base laterally from the radiograph.  Subsequent
 radiograph performed one day later includes this region and is dictated
 separately (clip, ___).
