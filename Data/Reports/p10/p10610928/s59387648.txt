                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral opacities.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities
 have decreased in density but increased in extent.  They are now seen
 relatively widespread in all lung regions.  This change is particularly
 obvious at the level of the right upper lobe and the right lower lobe. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Right central venous access line is
 unchanged.  Unchanged vertebral stabilization devices.  No new pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
