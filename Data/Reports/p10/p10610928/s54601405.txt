                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube was placed, distal aspect not
 well seen but coursing below the level of the diaphragm.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Prominence of the interstitial markings suggests fluid overload. 
 More confluent opacity at the right lung base may be due to vascular
 structures, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.
