                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the background of severe interstitial lung disease, which is
 predominantly reflected in fine reticulation of the lung periphery on each
 side, there are patchy superimposed opacities in the right upper lung as well
 as the left mid and lower lung worrisome for superimposed pneumonia.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lung volume are again low.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for
 differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia superimposed on
 severe underlying interstitial lung disease; although recent prior radiographs
 are not available for comparison and progression of chronic lung disease could
 be considered as an alternative, acute superimposed pneumonia seems most
 likely.
