                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are again demonstrated.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is
 again seen as well as more focal opacities within the left lung base, left
 perihilar region, and right upper lobe which are not significantly changed
 when compared to the prior exam.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are relatively unchanged with marked calcification of the aortic knob.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  The right PICC has
 been removed.  Assessment of the pulmonary vascularity is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively unchanged appearance of the chest compared to prior exam.
 Persistent opacities within the right upper lobe, left lung base and left
 perihilar region are redemonstrated on a background of chronic interstitial
 lung disease which on the prior chest CT was thought to reflect UIP or
 fibrosing NSIP.  As before, these more focal opacities may reflect progression
 of chronic interstitial lung disease, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung
 disease, or possibly infection.
