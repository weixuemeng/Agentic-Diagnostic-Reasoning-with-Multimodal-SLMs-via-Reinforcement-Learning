                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with interstitial lung disease presenting with
 respiratory distress. Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Extensive bilateral opacities are unchanged from the
 prior examination and likely reflect the patient underlying severe
 interstitial lung disease.  There is possibly increased opacification of the
 right lower lung, which may represent mild edema. Hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. There is
 no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased opacification of the right lower lung may reflect mild
 edema superimposed on chronic severe interstitial lung disease.
