                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  Diffuse interstitial opacities most pronounced
 within the periphery and lung bases with architectural distortion are
 unchanged compared to the previous chest CT and compatible with chronic
 interstitial lung disease, previously characterized as UIP or fibrosing NSIP. 
 Previously noted hazy opacities in both lungs has resolved.  No new areas of
 focal consolidation are demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings compatible chronic interstitial lung disease, previously
 characterized on chest CT as UIP or fibrosing NSIP.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.
