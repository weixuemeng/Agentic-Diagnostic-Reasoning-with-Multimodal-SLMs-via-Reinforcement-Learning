                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate right PICC positioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the chest are somewhat
 limited in the determination of the exact termination point of the right PICC,
 which is difficult to visualize amongst the mediastinal structures.  However,
 it appears to terminate in the lower portion of the SVC.  There has been
 marked improvement in the bilateral effusions and heterogeneous opacities when
 compared to the prior study.  Prominent interstitial lung markings reflect the
 patient's baseline pulmonary fibrosis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta
 is stably tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications in the arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right PICC is difficult to visualize but likely ends within the lower
 SVC.
 2.  Marked interval improvement in what was likely multifocal pneumonia as
 well as near complete clearance of the bilateral pleural effusions compared to
 ___.
 3.  Stable interstitial lung markings consistent with chronic pulmonary
 fibrosis.
