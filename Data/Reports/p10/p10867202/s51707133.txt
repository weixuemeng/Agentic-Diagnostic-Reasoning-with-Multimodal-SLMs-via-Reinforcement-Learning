                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary fibrosis and CHF with worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen
 compatible with patient's history of fibrosis.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs, but these appear overall
 slightly worse when compared to prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pulmonary fibrosis with likely
 superimposed edema. Please note that infection cannot be excluded and clinical
 correlation is necessary.
