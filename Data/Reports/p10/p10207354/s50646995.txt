                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of atrial
 fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
 
 Treated with tamoxifen due to breast cancer.
 
 Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to PET-CT
 from ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Assessment
 of the lungs demonstrates relatively low lung volumes as well as interstitial
 opacities in the lung bases with more focal appearance at the left lower lung.
 The findings might be consistent with interstitial lung disease and
 potentially infectious process in the left lower lobe.  Given the patient's
 history and described findings, evaluation of the patient with chest CT,
 preferably HRCT is recommended.  The patient is after left mastectomy.
