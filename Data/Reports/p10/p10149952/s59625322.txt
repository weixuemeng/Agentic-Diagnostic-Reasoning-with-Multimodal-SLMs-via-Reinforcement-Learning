 Relative to prior examination, there has been little interval change.  Heart
 is mildly enlarged. Hilar contours are stable in appearance. No focal opacity
 convincing for pneumonia is identified.  Linear densities at bilateral bases
 is most likely reflective of platelike atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures demonstrate no acute
 abnormality.
