                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside hospital chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Overdose, intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.7 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is seen extending along the midline with its tip coiled in
 the distal esophagus and the distal tip extending cephalexin in the mid
 esophagus region.  This positioning is unchanged from prior exam.  Please
 advance for more optimal positioning.  Since the prior exam, there is again
 noted to be extensive pulmonary airspace consolidation, slightly more
 confluent in the right lung, concerning for pneumonia.  Air bronchograms are
 noted in the left lower lobe.  Bony structures are intact.  The possibility of
 pulmonary edema is also raised.  No large effusions are seen.  Old right
 clavicular deformity noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube positioned appropriately.  
 2.  Malpositioned nasogastric tube with tip coiled in the distal esophagus. 
 Please advance for more optimal positioning.  
 3.  Diffuse pulmonary airspace consolidation concerning for pneumonia and/or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Findings posted and flagged to ED dashboard at the time of this dictation.
