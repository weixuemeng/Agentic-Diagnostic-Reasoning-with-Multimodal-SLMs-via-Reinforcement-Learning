                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestion and leukocytosis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume
 but clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal
 in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Incompletely assessed left
 shoulder again demonstrates multiple calcific densities which could reflect
 osteochondromatosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
