                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 23:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated with pneumonia/ARDS, check
 orogastric tube and endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 23:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled
 within the stomach.  Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the
 proximal SVC.  There is increasing airspace opacity in both lungs which may
 represent worsening consolidation related to atelectasis or pneumonia,
 although superimposed pulmonary edema should also be considered.  Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical
 assessment.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Probable layering bilateral
 effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 due to the bilateral airspace process.
