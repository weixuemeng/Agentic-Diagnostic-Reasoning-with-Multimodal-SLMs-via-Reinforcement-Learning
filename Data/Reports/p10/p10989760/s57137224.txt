                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Evaluate for line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right IJ loops in the vessel with the tip proceeding superiorly
 towards the head.  The tip is beyond the field of view.  An enteric tube
 courses through the esophagus below the left hemidiaphragm and out of the
 field of view.  The ET tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm from the carina.  
 
 The lung volumes are low. There are bilateral hazy opacities worse at the
 bases and right greater than left.  There is obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm and to a lesser extent the left hemidiaphragm likely from a
 combination of atelectasis and consolidation.  Underlying effusion is also
 possible.  Low lung volumes make evaluation of the heart size difficult;
 however, there is no gross cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter is misplaced with the tip
 proceeding superiorly towards the head.
 
 2.  Bilateral hazy opacities likely combination of consolidation and
 atalectasis; underlying infection is of concern in the right clinical setting.
 
 
 Results were telephoned to Dr. ___ by ___ at 5:50 pm, ___, 5
 minutes after discovery.
