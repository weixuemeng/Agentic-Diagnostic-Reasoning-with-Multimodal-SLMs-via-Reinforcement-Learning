                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ARDS and pulmonary edema, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 nearly 8 cm above the carina compared to about 5.5 cm before.  Bilateral
 internal jugular venous catheters appear unchanged.  An orogastric tube also
 enters the stomach.  There is increased bilateral perihilar opacification but
 with some improvement in aeration of the right lower lung.  This appearance
 suggests moderate vascular congestion, perhaps slightly increased, with
 similar probably moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions, within the
 limitations of technique.  Retrocardiac opacity is not as well imaged since
 the lower chest is partly excluded but is probably unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: High endotracheal tube; advancing the tube by 3-4 cm is suggested.
 Improved aeration of the right lower lung, otherwise not significant change.
