 catheter, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position,
 the nasogastric tube is thought to be coiled within a hiatal hernia.  There
 continues to be moderate layering bilateral effusions with stable bibasilar
 airspace consolidation which may represent atelectasis, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  Overall, there has been no significant
 interval change.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable, with the heart remaining stably enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
