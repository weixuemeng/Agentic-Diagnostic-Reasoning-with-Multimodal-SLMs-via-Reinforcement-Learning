 terminates at the distal esophagus, the side hole is seen at the midesophagus.
 Lung volumes are slightly decreased slightly accentuating the cardiac
 silhouette. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Adequate position of endotracheal tube. Trachea at the level of the
 endotracheal tube cuff is distended, suggesting the balloon may be over
 inflated 2. Orogastric tube terminates at the distal esophagus, advancing the
