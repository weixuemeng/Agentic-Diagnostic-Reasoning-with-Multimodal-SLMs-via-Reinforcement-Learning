                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. An opacity projecting over the
 lower lungs on the lateral view only without a correlate on the frontal view
 radiograph may represent atelectasis or focal pneumonia. Fullness in the
 region of the azygous vein suggests increased central venous volume without
 overt pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is upper limits of normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Opacity projecting over the lower lungs only on the lateral view may
 represent atelectasis or basal pneumonia. A repeat lateral radiograph with
 better inspiration may be helpful for further evaluation.
 2. Increased central venous volume without overt pulmonary edema.
