                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PPD, rule out TB.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal on the left.  On the right, however,
 there is a large area of apical pleural thickening, combines to subtotal
 atelectasis and deviation of the minor fissure towards the lung apex.  Hilus
 is also moved towards the lung apices.  These findings are typically seen in
 old TB.  In addition, two calcified granulomas are seen in the subpleural
 areas of the left hemithorax.  Overall, prior exposure to TB is very likely,
 but no evidence of active disease is seen on the current radiograph.
 
 The well-ventilated lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  No pleural effusions. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
