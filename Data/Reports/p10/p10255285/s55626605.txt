                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Correlation is made to CT C-spine performed the same day. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear.  Nodular
 opacities seen, 1 over each lung base, compatible with nipple shadows.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is slight
 leftward deviation and potentially mild narrowing of the trachea just below
 the thoracic inlet.  Hypertrophic changes seen in the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Leftward deviation of the trachea just
 below the thoracic inlet, potentially due to right thyroid enlargement. 
 Dedicated nonurgent thyroid ultrasound should be performed to confirm as this
 area was not included on CT cervical spine.
