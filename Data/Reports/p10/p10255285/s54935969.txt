                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, inspiration and expiration
 films show minimal if any pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas persists along the
 left lateral chest wall.  Little change in the appearance of the heart and
 lungs.
 
 Impression upon the lower cervical trachea on the right raises the possibility
 of a thyroid mass.
