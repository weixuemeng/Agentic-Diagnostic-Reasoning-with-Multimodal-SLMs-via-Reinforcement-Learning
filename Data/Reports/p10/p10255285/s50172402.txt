                                 FINAL REPORT

 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 8:57 p.m.
 
 The subcutaneous air within the left chest wall is unchanged.  The left chest
 tube is in place.  The apical pneumothorax is re-demonstrated.  Mediastinal
 silhouette is grossly stable.  There is slight interval worsening of the left
 mid and lower lung opacity that should be closely followed on the subsequent
