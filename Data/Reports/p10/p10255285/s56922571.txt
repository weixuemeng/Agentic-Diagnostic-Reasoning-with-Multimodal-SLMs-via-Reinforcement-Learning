                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post left upper lobectomy with several clips
 demonstrated in the left mid lung field.  Linear and patchy opacities within
 the medial left lung base likely reflect atelectatic changes, with leftward
 shift of mediastinal structures and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 compatible with evidence of volume loss.  The amount of subcutaneous emphysema
 in the left chest wall has decreased since the previous study, and the
 previously demonstrated small left apical pneumothorax appears to have
 resolved with a small amount of fluid now seen in the left pleural space.  The
 right lung is clear.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postsurgical changes in the left hemithorax with decreased subcutaneous
 emphysema in the left chest wall.  Previously identified left apical
 pneumothorax now appears to have resolved with small amount of fluid seen in
 the pleural space.  No definite pneumonia visualized.
