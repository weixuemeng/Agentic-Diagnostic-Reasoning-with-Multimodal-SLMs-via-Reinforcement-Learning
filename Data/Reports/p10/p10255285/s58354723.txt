                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonectomy with chest tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Obliquity of the patient greatly obscures detail.  No definite
 left-sided pneumothorax in the presence of a chest tube, though this is
 difficult to assess due to the position of the patient.  There is extensive
 gas in the subcutaneous region from the upper left abdomen extending into the
 neck.
 
 Right lung is essentially clear.
