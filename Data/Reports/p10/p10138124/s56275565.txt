                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p ex lap, LOA of SBO  // ? NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube tip is in the proximal stomach.  There are multiple dilated small
 bowel loops, mildly improved since prior.  Very shallow inspiration. 
 Bibasilar opacities are new, likely atelectasis.  Pneumonitis cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Shallow inspiration accentuates
 heart size, pulmonary vascularity.  There may be tiny left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.
