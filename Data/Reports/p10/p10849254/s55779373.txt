                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, question contusion on CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right apical
 opacity is partially obscured by overlapping osseous structures and was better
 evaluated on CT.  Findings on CT may have been due to aspiration, infection,
 or contusion.  Recommend followup chest CT to assess for resolution.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Triple-lead left-sided
 pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical opacity is partially obscured by overlapping osseous
 structures and was better evaluated on CT.  Findings on CT may have been due
 to aspiration, infection, or contusion, given history of trauma.  Recommend
 follow-up chest CT for further evaluation and to assess resolution/exclude an
 underlying pulmonary lesion.
