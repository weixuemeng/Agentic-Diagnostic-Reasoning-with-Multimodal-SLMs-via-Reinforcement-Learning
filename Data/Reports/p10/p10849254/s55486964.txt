                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with systolic and diastolic CHF, presenting with
 MRSA bacteremia, CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, and PNA.  // ?PNA,
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the prior study resulting crowding of the
 pulmonary bronchovascular structures.  Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities
 with prominence of the hila is most consistent with congestive heart failure. 
 There is left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.  Probable left
 pleural effusion.  A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, unchanged in position
 when compared to the prior study and obscuring the left mid lung.  He reverse
 right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities likely reflecting pulmonary edema. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Probable small left pleural effusion.
