 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:42 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC line, check placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 12:42 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in
 the mid SVC.  A left-sided AICD remains in place with three leads unchanged in
 position.  The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given
 patient's rotation to the left on the current study.  Lungs are well inflated
 without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  A few streaky opacities at the right costophrenic
 angle may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
