                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An opacity at the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragm and may be
 due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. A small right
 pleural effusion is also present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Included upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Opacity at the left lung base may be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis. However, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Repeat PA and lateral views could be helpful
 when clinically appropriate.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
