                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates widespread bilateral
 confluent opacities on a background of reticular interstitial lung disease. 
 There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, and a small effusion on the
 left cannot be excluded.  This appearance is nonspecific and could represent
 consolidation, aspiration, and/or pulmonary edema.  The heart is likely normal
 in size, although cardiac borders are obscured.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.  Lung apices are relatively clear.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities on a background
 interstitial lung disease.  Differential considerations include infection,
 aspiration, and/or pulmonary edema.  Correlate with clinical presentation.
