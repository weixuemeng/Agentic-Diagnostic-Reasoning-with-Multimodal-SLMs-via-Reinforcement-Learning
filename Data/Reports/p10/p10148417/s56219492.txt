                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was compared with
 prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina,
 orogastric tube is positioned into the stomach; however, the sideport ends
 just below the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  Consider advancing the
 orogastric tube further for better seating.  Right internal jugular line ends
 at right atrium.  The persisting multifocal parenchymal opacities over a
 background of reticular interstitial abnormality suggesting fibrosis has
 worsened in the right upper lung.  Bilateral pleural effusions are probably
 small and stable.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral multifocal lung opacities on the background of lung fibrosis
 have worsened in the right upper lung and likely reflect multifocal pneumonia;
 however, a component of edema is possible.
 
 2.  Orogastric tube is in the stomach but the sideport is just below the GE
 junction.  Consider advancing the OG tube by approximately 5 cm for better
 positioning.  
 
 Findings in specific to OGT was discussed with IV nurse, ___. ___, on
 ___ at 10:50 a.m.
