                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxemic respiratory failure, assess
 for interval progression.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:09.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 3:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A right internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2.8 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 likely within the stomach.  A left subclavian PICC line also has its tip in
 the superior vena cava.
 
 Overall, cardiomediastinal contours are stable, although difficult to assess
 due to the diffuse interstitial airspace process, which is essentially
 unchanged and may represent chronic interstitial changes, although a
 superimposed acute infectious process or pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. 
 No pneumothorax.
