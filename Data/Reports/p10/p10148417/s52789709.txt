                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube passes
 into the stomach.  There is a right IJ line, extends to the cavoatrial
 junction.  No change in appearance of the lungs, with persistent multifocal
 parenchymal opacities superimposed on baseline reticular interstitial
 abnormality suggesting fibrosis.  The opacities remain worst at the left base
 and left mid lung laterally.  Small pleural effusions are likely present. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities with underlying
 interstitial abnormality, likely fibrosis.  This most likely reflects
 multifocal pnuemonia, possibly with a component of pulmonary edema.
