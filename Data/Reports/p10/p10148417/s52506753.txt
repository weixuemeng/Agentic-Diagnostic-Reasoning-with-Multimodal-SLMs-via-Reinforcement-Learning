                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma and colon cancer with weakness and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification is again
 seen, consistent with extensive pulmonary fibrosis.  However, the possibility
 of supervening pneumonia or pulmonary edema would be difficult to exclude
 radiographically.
