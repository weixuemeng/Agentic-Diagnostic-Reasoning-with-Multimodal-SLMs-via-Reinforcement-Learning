                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with sarcoid and frequent recent pneumonia, with
 cough and sputum production.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There is greater consolidation in the right upper lobe joining a region of
 probable sarcoid scarring, as well as in the right middle lobe, better
 appreciated on the lateral view, compared to ___.  Findings are
 certainly consistent with acute pneumonia, but given the geographic
 association of the upper lobe infection with a region of chronic abnormality,
 this area needs to be followed closely to make sure there is no indolent
 infection, in a region of sarcoid involvement, or any structural explanation
 such as bronchial stricture.
 
 There has been no change in the extent of central adenopathy, and there is no
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Dr. ___ was notified by Dr. ___ by telephone of possibility of pneumonia,
 5:30 p.m. on ___.
