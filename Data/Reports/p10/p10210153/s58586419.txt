                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax. A right pleural effusion is tiny. There is small change in
 the left upper lobe vessel caliber, but the hila are unchanged. The
 mediastinal silhouette is stable with aortic tortuosity. Pulmonary arterial
 enlargement is better seen on CTA ___. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest severe chronic pulmonary hypretension with
 possible early cardiac decompensation. No pneumonia.
