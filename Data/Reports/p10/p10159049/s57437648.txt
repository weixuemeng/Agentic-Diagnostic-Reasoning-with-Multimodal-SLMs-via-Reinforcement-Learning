  Low lung volumes with atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation.
  
  Mild anterior wedging of at least 2 lower thoracic vertebral bodies is of
  indeterminate age, but could be degenerative.  Correlate clinically for acute
  injury and need for additional imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia, s/p fall  // please evaluate for
 acute injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes.  There
 is subsequent atelectasis at the bases.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart size is probably within
 normal limits, its size exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes. 
 Suboptimal evaluation for rib fracture, if clinical concern, CT is more
 sensitive.  Mild anterior wedging of at least 2 lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies is of indeterminate age, but could be degenerative.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation.
 
 Mild anterior wedging of at least 2 lower thoracic vertebral bodies is of
 indeterminate age, but could be degenerative.  Correlate clinically for acute
 injury and need for additional imaging.
