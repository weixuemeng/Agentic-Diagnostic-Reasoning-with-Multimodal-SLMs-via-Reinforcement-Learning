 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is further engorgement
 of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure,
 possibly exacerbated by overhydration.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with probable bilateral effusions and basilar atelectasis.  Central
 catheter remains in place.
