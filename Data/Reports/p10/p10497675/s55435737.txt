                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent esophageal dilation for
 strictures, with intermittent epigastric pain.  Underwent surgical procedure
 for "collapsed lung".
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Changes of right upper lobectomy are seen, with
 hilar/mediastinal clips and chain suture, hilar retraction and apical pleural
 thickening or loculated fluid.  Left lung apex is scarred, but both lower
 lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is no obvious
 pneumomediastinum, but the esophagus may be dilated above the ___ of the
 carina. There is no pneumothorax or free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable right upper lobectomy, and left upper lobe scarring. 
 2.  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
 3.  Retrotracheal esophagus may be dilated.  CT scanning would be required for
 its assessment and examination of the surrounding mediastinum.
