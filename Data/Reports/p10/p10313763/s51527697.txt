 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened to the point of early pulmonary
 edema, increasing the small right pleural effusion as well as vascular
 caliber.  Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases could be any

 lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged and the azygos vein is borderline distended.
