                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  There is
 airspace consolidation involving the bilateral lower lungs which could
 represent pneumonia with possible associated pleural effusion.  A lateral view
 would aid in diagnosis.  Heart size cannot be fully assessed due to
 silhouetting by adjacent consolidation.  There is faint atherosclerotic
 calcification along the aortic knob.  No pneumothorax.  Upper lungs are well
 aerated.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung opacities could represent pneumonia with effusion. 
 Would recommend dedicated PA and lateral views to more clearly assess.
