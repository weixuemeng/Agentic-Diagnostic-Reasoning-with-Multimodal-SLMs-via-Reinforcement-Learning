                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia, pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now evidence of
 bilateral moderate pleural effusions.  In addition, an opacity is seen in the
 middle lobe, better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal image. 
 This opacity corresponds to pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, as
 suspected in the previous report.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No additional lung parenchymal
 findings.
