                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fatigue and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest.  The lungs are grossly clear
 within limitation of patient's positioning and the lung apices are obscured by
 the patient's chin.  There is rotation to the left.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unremarkable, although atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted at the aortic arch.  Left-sided PICC is identified, although the tip
 is difficult to assess in positioning given patient's positioning.  Tubes also
 project over the abdomen bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
