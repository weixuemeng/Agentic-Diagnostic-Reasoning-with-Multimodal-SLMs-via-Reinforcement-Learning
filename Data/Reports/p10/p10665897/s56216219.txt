                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease with recent hemodialysis
 catheter removal, here to reevaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a left subclavian approach
 hemodialysis catheter from the most recent prior study.  Otherwise, the
 appearance of the chest is little changed.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Calcification of the aortic knob
 is noted.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen with
 small osteophyte formation.  There is no free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of hemodialysis catheter with no acute findings
 in the chest.
