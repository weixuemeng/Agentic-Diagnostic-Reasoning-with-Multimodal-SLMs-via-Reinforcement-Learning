                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of bacteremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-lumen right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the
 distal SVC and cavoatrial junction.  There is blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, which may be due to a small pleural effusion and/or
 pleural thickening.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  The left lung
 is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to
 a small pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.
