                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy, fever, neck pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the
 expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due
 to overlying soft tissue although trace pleural effusion is not excluded. 
 Anchor screws are seen overlying the right humeral head.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to overlying soft
 tissue, but trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  No focal consolidation.
