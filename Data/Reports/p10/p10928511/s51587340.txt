                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent fall.  // plz eval for infectious
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Again seen is a left-sided 2 lead pacemaker with the
 leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle.  There appears to be more
 pronounced right perihilar prominence than on prior examinations, which in the
 appropriate clinical context, may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 perihilar infiltrate .The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 Right perihilar prominence may represent mild asymmetric edema, localized
 aspiration, or early infectious pneumonia.  Follow-up imaging after diuresis
 can be obtained for further evaluation if warranted clinically.
