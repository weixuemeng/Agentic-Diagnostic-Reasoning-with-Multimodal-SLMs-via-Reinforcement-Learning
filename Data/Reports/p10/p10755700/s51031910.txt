                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bronchial breath sounds in both lungs, right
 greater than left.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lung volumes are low, with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings in both lung bases.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary
 edema is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes, limiting evaluation of pulmonary
 pathology. PA and lateral radiograph is recommended, when feasible.
