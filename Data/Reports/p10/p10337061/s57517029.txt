                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute renal insufficiency.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained with the
 patient rotated slightly to the right.  The previously seen right PICC is no
 longer present.  On the lateral view, there is blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles, consistent with small pleural effusions with likely
 overlying atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacity likely represents combination of the
 above, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is
 prominence of the hilar vasculature suggesting pulmonary edema.  Enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is somewhat similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation difficult to exclude.
 2.  Pulmonary edema.
