  Underpenetrated film.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Despite differences in
  positioning, probable slight increase in central venous congestion, mild
  interstitial edema, and moderate layering pleural effusions.  Increased
  bibasilar opacities- these may be due to layering effusions, but superimposed
  imfection not excluded, particularly at right lung base which has a
  consolidative appearance.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and
 layering pleural effusions with underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude a
 supervening pneumonia at the bases.
