                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with exertional chest pain and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  A left-sided dual-lumen
 pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion appears new in
 the interval.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities,
 possibly atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
