 deemed not intervenable now with PEA arrest after respiratory distress and
 intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since most recent radiograph, there is no significant interval change.  Again
 seen is bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis, not significantly changed
 from prior. The ET tube now terminates approximately 2.5 cm from the carina,
 which may be due to patient positioning.  Otherwise, there is no appreciable
 change in support lines.  Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are in place.

 No significant interval change.
