 corresponded to a non-enhancing heterogeneously mediastinal lesion is no

 stable mammilation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. Bilateral pleural thickening and subsegmental atelectasis are
 unchanged. There is no new focal consolidations or pneumothorax.  A small
 right pleural effusion has resolved.
