 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M CAD, Afib here with NSTEMI and occlusion of SVG-OM which was
 deemed not intervenable now with PEA arrest after respiratory distress and
 intubation.  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supportive a monitoring equipment is unchanged in appearance when compared to
 the prior study.  Severe cardiomegaly, also unchanged.  There is prominence of
 the bilateral hila with hazy opacity at the right lung base likely reflecting
 a layering pleural effusion.  Prominence of the pulmonary vascular is
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left lobe were lobe
 atelectasis.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema predominately effects the right lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a layering pleural
