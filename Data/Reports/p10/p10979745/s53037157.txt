                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with active chest pain, evaluate acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  This study is mildly underpenetrated due to body habitus.  Trace
 left pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours may be mildly
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
