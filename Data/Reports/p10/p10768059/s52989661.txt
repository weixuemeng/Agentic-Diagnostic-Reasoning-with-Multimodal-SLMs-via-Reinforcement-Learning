                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Linear opacity at the left
 lung base most suggestive of atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 without consolidation or large effusion.  There is, however, blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles, raising possibility of trace effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Descending thoracic
 aorta is again noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small pleural effusions, new since prior.  Otherwise, no change
 from prior.
