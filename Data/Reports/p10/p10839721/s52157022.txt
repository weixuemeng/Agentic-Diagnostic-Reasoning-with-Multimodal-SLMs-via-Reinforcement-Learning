                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal and chest pain.  GI bleed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  The heart size
 is top normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Streaky patchy opacities are demonstrated within the right
 lung base.  No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  No free air under the diaphragms is noted.  There is no acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right lung base, which is nonspecific, and may
 reflect atelectasis.  Aspiration or early infection is not excluded.
