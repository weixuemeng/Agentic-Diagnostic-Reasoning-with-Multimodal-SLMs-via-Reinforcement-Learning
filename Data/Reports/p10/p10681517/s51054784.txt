                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___; CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. Mild opacity at the lung bases
 likely represents atelectasis, but early or developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax. A
 small left effusion cannot be excluded. Pulmonary edema has improved with mild
 residual pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette
 hilar contours are normal allowing for low lung volumes. A nonspecific 1.3cm
 nodule is seen at the right apex and could be related to infection or prior
 edema. The prior CTA does not include the lung apices to evaluate this. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Improved pulmonary edema with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Bibasilar opacities may be atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting. 
 3. 1.3cm nonspecific right apical nodule. Recommend repeat radiograph after
 treatment, preferrably with better lung volumes.
 
 Preliminary findings of "no edema, right basilar opacity" were discussed with
 Dr. ___ in person at 2:55pm on ___.
 
 Updated findings after attending review were emailed to the ED QA nurses at
 5pm on ___.
