 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  1.3-cm nodule seen on plain film, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously seen right
 apical nodule is no longer visible.  The lung volumes have increased, there is
 an area of minimal opacity in the retrocardiac lung region, likely reflecting
 a healing pneumonia.
 
 If the suspicion of a lung nodule persists, the patient should undergo CT
 regardless of the chest radiographic resolution, given the improved
 sensitivity of the technique.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusions.
