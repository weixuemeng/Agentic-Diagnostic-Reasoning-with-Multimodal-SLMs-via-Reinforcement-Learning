  1. Endotracheal tube and PA catheter in appropriate position.  Multiple
  mediastinal tubes and a left chest tube in place.  The enteric to the
  terminates in the distal esophagus.  This can be advanced at least 15 cm in
  order to place the side port past the gastroesophageal junction.
  2. Retrocardiac opacity, likely related to atelectasis.  Apparent cardiac
  enlargement compared to preoperative radiograph, likely a combination of
  expected postsurgical changes and projection.
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on

 The other monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter and
 the left chest tube are also in correct position.  The tip of the intra-aortic
 balloon pump is approximately 2.5 cm below the upper most portion of the
 aortic arch.  The device could be advanced by 1.5 cm.  In the interval, the
 patient has undergone cardiac surgery.  The alignment of the sternal wires is
 unremarkable.  No larger pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac
