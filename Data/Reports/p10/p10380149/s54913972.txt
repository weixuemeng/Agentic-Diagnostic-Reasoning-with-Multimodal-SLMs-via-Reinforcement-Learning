                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea.  Evaluation for pneumonia versus CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the same day radiographs from 3 hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP radiograph demonstrates persistent increased interstitial markings
 and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, particularly on the right,
 along with blunting of the costophrenic angles, as before.  Additionally, more
 distinct opacities are present within the right upper and right lower lobes,
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Multilevel degenerative changes within the thoracic spine are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacities within the right upper and right lower lobes are concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia, in the correct clinical setting.  
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
