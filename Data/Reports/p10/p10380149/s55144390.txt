                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single-lead pacer extends to the region of the apex of the right
 ventricle.  No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 essentially within normal limits.  No definite acute focal pneumonia.
