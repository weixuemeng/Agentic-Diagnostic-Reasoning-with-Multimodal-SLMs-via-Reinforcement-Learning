                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart block, recent aortic valve surgery.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post aortic valve prosthesis, in unchanged position. 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities appearing slightly
 improved in the interval.  No new area of consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are present within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight interval
 improvement in aeration of the lung bases likely reflective of improving
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 persist.
