                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain, tachycardia, history of
 pulmonary embolism
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged, accentuated due to
 low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within
 normal limits.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures likely relates to
 low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung
 bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Clips project over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
