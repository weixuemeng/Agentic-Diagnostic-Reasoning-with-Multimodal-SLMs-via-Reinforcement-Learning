 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is performed on a trauma board.  There is a dual lead
 pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle,
 respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified. 
 There is a convex contour to the right upper mediastinum, indeterminate,
 although most often seen with tortuosity of the great vessels.  A band-like
 opacity in the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis.  There is also
 streaky bibasilar opacifications suggesting minor atelectasis with low lung
 volumes.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prior
 vertebroplasties have been performed along the lower thoracic spine at two
 levels.  The bones are probably demineralized.  Surgical clips project over
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of injury.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Convex
 contour to the right upper mediastinum, indeterminate, although most likely a
 normal variant; however, correlation of planned CT is recommended.
