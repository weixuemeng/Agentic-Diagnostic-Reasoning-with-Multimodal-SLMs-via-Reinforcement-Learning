                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior MRSA pneumonia.  Evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, ___.  CT Chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus and pleural thickening, likely sequelae of prior
 pneumonia.  Residual scarring is also seen in the right upper and lower lung,
 corresponding to abnormalities on prior CT-Chest.  There is no focal
 consolidation, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia.  Multifocal scarring,
 corresponding to consolidations on prior CT.
