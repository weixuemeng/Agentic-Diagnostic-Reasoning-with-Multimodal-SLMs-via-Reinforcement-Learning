                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intractable right
 shoulder pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph for comparison.  Reference is made to
 chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Pulmonary
 nodules seen on prior CT are better appreciated on that study as CT is more
 sensitive.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
