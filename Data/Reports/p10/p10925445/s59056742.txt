                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Esophageal dilatation one week ago.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates mild
 calcification at the aortic arch.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  A
 7-mm calcified nodule within the left lower lobe is again demonstrated
 compatible with a granuloma.  Hyperinflation of lungs is unchanged suggestive
 of underlying COPD.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical
 anchors from prior rotator cuff repair are seen within the right humeral head,
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
