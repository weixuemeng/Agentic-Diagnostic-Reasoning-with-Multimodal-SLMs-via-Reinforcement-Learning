                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with r ankle fracture  // Pre Op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  Distortion of the parenchyma suggest
 chronic underlying fibrotic changes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. 
 Chronic changes seen at the right humerus which are not fully assessed. 
 Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is not well seen due
 to osteopenia and is age indeterminate.  Bilateral posterior rib fractures
 appear old.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation with distortion of the parenchyma raising the possibility of
 underlying COPD.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate.
