                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff is seen in the stomach.  The widespread pulmonary
 abnormalities are unchanged with opacification in the right upper and left
 lower lobes, which is most likely due to multifocal pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff within the stomach.
 2.  No significant change in probable multifocal pneumonia and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
