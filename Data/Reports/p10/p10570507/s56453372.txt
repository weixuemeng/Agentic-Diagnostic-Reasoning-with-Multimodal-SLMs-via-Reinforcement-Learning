                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier the same date and earlier radiographs
 dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists throughout the right
 chest wall and extending into the soft tissues of the neck bilaterally.  The
 degree of subcutaneous emphysema markedly limits the assessment of the right
 lung, particularly for the presence of pneumothorax.  An unusual crescenteric
 radiolucency overlies the lower right lung and could potentially represent a
 pneumothorax. Within the left lung, linear atelectasis persists at the base. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  Questionable right
 pneumothorax for which followup radiograph is recommended as discussed with
 Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 8:20 a.m.
