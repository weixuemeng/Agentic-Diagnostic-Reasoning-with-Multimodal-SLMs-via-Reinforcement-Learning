                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated throughout the right
 chest wall, imaged cervical region and to lesser extent within the left chest
 wall.  The degree of subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall limits
 evaluation for pneumothorax of the right lung.  Post-operative changes are
 again demonstrated consistent with history of right middle lobe resection. 
 Within the left lung, linear atelectasis persists at the left base. Persistent
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
