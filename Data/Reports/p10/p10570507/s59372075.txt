                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated throughout
 the right chest wall and in both cervical regions.  Overall, this has
 minimally decreased compared to the prior radiograph.  The degree of
 subcutaneous emphysema limits assessment of the right lung and pleura.  As
 before, there are a few unusual curvilinear lucencies within the right
 hemithorax, for which pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  The patient is status
 post right middle lobe resection.  On the left, linear atelectasis has
 slightly worsened at the left base.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 present.
