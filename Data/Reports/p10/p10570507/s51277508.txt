                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subcutaneous emphysema after chest tube removal.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, the amount of subcutaneous emphysema
 has slightly decreased.  Post-surgical changes are seen at the right base
 adjacent to the pericardial surface.  There is no definite pneumothorax,
 although a small pneumothorax cannot be excluded as it would be obscured by
 the subcutaneous air.  The right lung has increased hazy opacification in
 comparison to the prior exam, which is most likely technical due to the degree
 of penetration.  Less likely, it could be a new large pleural effusion, but
 given that it is not present on the lateral exam, it is likely technical. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There has been slight increase in the
 left basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight decrease in subcutaneous air.
 2.  No definite pneumothorax.
 3.  Slight increase in left basilar atelectasis.
 4.  Hazy opacification of the right lung is likely technical, although pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Would recommend repeat radiographs in four hours
 for reevaluation.
 
 Results were discussed with the surgical team at 11:30 am on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___.
