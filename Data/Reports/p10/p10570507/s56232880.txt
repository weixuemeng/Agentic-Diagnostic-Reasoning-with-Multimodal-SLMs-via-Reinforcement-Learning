                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right chest wall crepitus, status post
 removal of chest tube, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the portable study of ___ at 9:04.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at 14:15.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is extensive right-sided subcutaneous emphysema, which extends up
 into the neck and crosses the midline and also involves the left neck and the
 back.  This makes it difficult to evaluate the right lung, but no large
 pneumothorax can be appreciated.  The left lung is clear.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  If pneumothorax remains of clinical
 concern, imaging evaluation with CT may prove useful.
