                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever, cirrhosis.  Recently given fluid
 bolus.  Evaluation for worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph demonstrates interval worsening of bilateral
 hazy opacifications in the lung bases which is likely due to worsening
 pulmonary edema.  There is also an increase in right pleural effusion with
 fluid seen tracking along the oblique fissure.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is an ill-defined hazy opacity in the right upper lung which is seen on
 previous radiographs and may represent an area of scarring, however this
 should be correlated clinically.  The heart size is not significantly changed
 since the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval worsening of bilateral pulmonary edema and right pleural
 effusion.  Previously seen right upper lung opacity may represent an area of
 scarring and should be correlated clinically.
