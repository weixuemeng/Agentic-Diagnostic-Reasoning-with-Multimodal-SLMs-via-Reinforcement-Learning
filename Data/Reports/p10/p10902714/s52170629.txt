                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new right internal jugular catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular
 catheter with tip projecting over the expected level of the mid superior vena
 cava.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Right pleural effusion tracking into a
 fissure persists.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  A stent projecting over the right upper quadrant is partially imaged.
 Subtle left mid-lung opacity is more apparent than on prior chest radiograph. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter with tip projecting
 at the level of the mid superior vena cava.
 2. Subtle left medial lung opacity, which may represent atelectasis but
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs are
 recommended if clinically feasible. Otherwise, attention on follow-up is
 recommended. 
 
 Updated findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by
 ___ by phone at 3:50 p.m. on ___ after attending radiologist
 review.
