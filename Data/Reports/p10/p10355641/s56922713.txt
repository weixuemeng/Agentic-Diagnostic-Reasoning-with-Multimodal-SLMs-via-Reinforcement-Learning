                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with presyncope, evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear,
 well-expanded lungs without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 Sclerosis in the left humeral head with a pattern of arcs consistent with a
 chondroid lesion such as enchondroma.  There is no associated soft tissue mass
 or cortical destruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute chest abnormality.
 
 2.  Chondroid matrix within the left humeral head likely represents a benign
 entity such as enchondroma.  If there is pain referable to this region, this
 could be better evaluated with MRI to exclude a more aggressive chondroid
 lesion.
