                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unchanged mediastinal
 and hilar contours.  Heart size is stable and top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 There is a questionable small 6 mm nodular opacity at the right lung base,
 which may be artifactual or overlap of structures, but not clearly seen on
 prior studies, and an underlying nodule can not be entirely excluded.  No
 focal consolidation is seen.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles,
 unchanged since ___ is likely related to pleural scarring.  No
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable small 6 mm nodular opacity at the right lung base,
 which may be artifactual or overlap of structures, but not clearly seen on
 prior studies, and an underlying nodule can not be entirely excluded. 
 Recommend nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation.
