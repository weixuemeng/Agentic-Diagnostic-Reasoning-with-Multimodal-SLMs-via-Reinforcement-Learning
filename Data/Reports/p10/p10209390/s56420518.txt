                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with known effusion,
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  There is essentially complete opacification of the
 left hemithorax.  A small faint area of residual lucency is seen in the upper
 zone, but this is decreased compared with ___.  The mediastinum remains
 grossly midline, though the possibility of slight rightward shift of
 mediastinum would be difficult to exclude.  The right lung remains grossly
 clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  Possible minimal
 atelectasis at right lung base.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening opacification of the left hemithorax.  Only minimal
 residual aeration present.  Right lung grossly clear.
