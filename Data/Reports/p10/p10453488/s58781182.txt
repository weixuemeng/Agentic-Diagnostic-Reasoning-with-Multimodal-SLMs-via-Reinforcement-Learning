 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain radiating to the abdomen, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate low lung

 chin.  The imaged portions of the lungs appear clear.  No large effusion or
 definite signs of pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  The
 mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  The bony structures are diffusely
 demineralized though appear intact.  Thoracic kyphosis is exaggerated.
