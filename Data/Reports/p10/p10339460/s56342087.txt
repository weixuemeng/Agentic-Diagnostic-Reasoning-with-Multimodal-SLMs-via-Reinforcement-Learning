                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 21:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, evaluate for infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 18:31.
 
 An AP semi-upright portable chest film ___ at 21:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The lungs appear
 relatively well inflated.  There is subtle linear opacity at the left base but
 this does not appear to be changed since ___ and therefore likely
 reflects post-inflammatory scarring rather than an acute infectious process. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  A portion of spinal hardware is seen overlying the
 lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
