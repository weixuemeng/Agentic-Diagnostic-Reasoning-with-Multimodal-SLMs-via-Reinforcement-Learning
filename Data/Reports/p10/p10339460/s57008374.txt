  Mild pulmonary edema.  Opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectasis,
  though, pneumonia could be considered as well.  A small nodule is again seen
  at the right lung base with better evaluated on the prior CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. 
 There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Left basilar opacification could merely
 reflect atelectasis, though in view of the clinical history, supervening
 pneumonia must be seriously considered.  Small nodular opacification at the
 right base laterally was better evaluated on prior CT scan.
