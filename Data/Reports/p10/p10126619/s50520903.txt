 HISTORY:  Confusion.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Thoracolumbar scoliosis is again seen.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  Linear streaky left base
 retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view without clear correlate on the
 lateral view, most likely represents atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
