                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Developmental delay, syncope, headache.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices.  The patient
 appears to be kyphotic in position.  Mediastinum appears somewhat prominent,
 although there is suggestion that the patient may have a dilated esophagus and
 the mediastinum is not well evaluated.  If patient able, suggest dedicated PA
 and lateral views for further and better evaluation and/or comparison with
 prior studies.  There is left ___ and ___ opacity which could be due
 to atelectasis, aspiration and/or infection.  No large pleural effusion.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.
 
 What appear to be chain sutures are noted in the left upper to mid abdomen. 
 There is gaseous distention of bowel partially imaged in the left upper
 quadrant/abdomen, not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left ___ and ___ opacity could be due to
 atelectasis, infection and/or aspiration.  There is prominence of the
 mediastinum, which may relate to a dilated esophagus.  This could be further
 assessed on the dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able and also
 comparison with prior studies.  Chest CT is pending.
