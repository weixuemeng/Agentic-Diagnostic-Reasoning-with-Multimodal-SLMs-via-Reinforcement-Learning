 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the SVC/ right atrial junction. 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in lung bases likely atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis,
 without focal consolidation.
