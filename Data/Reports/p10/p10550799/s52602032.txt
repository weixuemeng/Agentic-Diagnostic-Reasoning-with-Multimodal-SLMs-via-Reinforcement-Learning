                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and worsening hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is progression of the
 pneumonia bilaterally, more obvious on the right than on the left.  However,
 the extent and severity of the changes is substantial.  The pleural effusion,
 better evaluated on the lateral radiograph, is slightly more extensive on the
 lateral image, but is still relatively extensive.  No change in appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette.
