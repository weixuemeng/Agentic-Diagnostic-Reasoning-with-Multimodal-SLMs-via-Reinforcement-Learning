                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute-onset hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion but
 also elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. It's possible that a component of
 this is largely sub-pulmonic.  Cardiac size is top normal but exaggerated by
 low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax is present.
