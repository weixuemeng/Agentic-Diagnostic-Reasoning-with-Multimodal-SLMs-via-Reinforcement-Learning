                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 00:29.  CT of the chest
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately
 3.5 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with
 the tip out of the field of view.  Since the prior exam, the moderate-sized
 right pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size.  Bibasilar
 consolidations appear slightly worse, particularly on the right.  This is
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia, likely with a component of increasing
 pulmonary edeam given the rapid interval change.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
 2.  Slight interval worsening of the bilateral opacities, particularly on the
 right, consistent with a combination of worsening edema and pneumonia.
 3.  Slight interval increase in the moderate sized right pleural effusion.
