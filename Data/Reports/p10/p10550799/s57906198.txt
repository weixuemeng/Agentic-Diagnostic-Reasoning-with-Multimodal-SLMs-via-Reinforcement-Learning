                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal right greater than left parenchymal opacities persist
 with increased density at the right apex.  Large right-sided effusion has
 increased and the small left effusion is roughly unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter, left internal
 jugular dialysis catheter, endotracheal tube, and upper enteric tube are
 unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent multifocal parenchymal opacities with increased right
 apical consolidation and increased right effusion.  This represents at least
 increasing pulmonary edema and is likely complicated by supervening pneumonia.
