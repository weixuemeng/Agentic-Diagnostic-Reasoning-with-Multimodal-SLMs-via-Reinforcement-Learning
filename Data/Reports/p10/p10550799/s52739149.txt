                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Crackles at the right base.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Left basilar ill-defined opacity is noted as well as minimal
 right basilar patchy opacity.  Bilateral pleural effusions are identified,
 small on the left and moderate on the right, with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm seen. There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflective of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.
 
 2. Small left and moderate size right bilateral pleural effusions.  Elevated
 right hemidiaphragm.
