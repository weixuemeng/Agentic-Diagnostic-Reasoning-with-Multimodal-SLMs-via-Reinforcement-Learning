                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous opacities in the left lung have only partially
 improved compared to the previous study, with substantial opacities remaining,
 particularly in the left juxtahilar and retrocardiac regions.  Additionally, a
 poorly defined opacity in the left upper lobe at the level of the left third
 anterior rib appears more conspicuous than on the prior study.  The right lung
 is clear.  Heart size remains normal.  Fullness of left hilar contour suggests
 possible lymphadenopathy.  Small hiatal hernia is incidentally noted.  There
 are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  The bones are demineralized, and
 mild compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Only partial improvement of left lung abnormalities since
 ___. Chest CT is recommended for further characterization as
 entered into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
