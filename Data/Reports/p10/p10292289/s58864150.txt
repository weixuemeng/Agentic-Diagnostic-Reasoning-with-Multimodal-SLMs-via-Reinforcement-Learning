                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post hiatal hernia repair, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is no pneumothorax.  A new
 nasogastric tube passes inferiorly out of view with the side port over the
 expected location of the stomach.  The cardiac pacemaker and its two leads are
 in appropriate and unchanged position.
 
 The lung volumes are markedly low.  There are bilateral pleural effusions. 
 The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours cannot be fully evaluated due to the
 low lung volumes.  The pulmonary vessels are crowded, but there is no evidence
 of edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Markedly low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusion.
 3.  New nasogastric tube in appropriate position.
