                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:00 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute MI.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is probably unchanged, though partially obscured by the right
 hemidiaphragm, behind which the left lower lobe is consolidated, more likely
 atelectasis than pneumonia.  Upper lungs are clear.  Transvenous right atrial
 and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses, unchanged.
