                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change
 and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  
 
 There is a slight impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea,
 which could reflect thyroid enlargement.  Of incidental note is an old healed
 fracture of the mid portion of the right clavicle.
