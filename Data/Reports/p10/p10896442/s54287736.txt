 unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is visualized. There are clips seen in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Mild
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.

 Mild bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
