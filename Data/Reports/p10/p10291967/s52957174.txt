 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Mild linear opacities are noted in both lung bases, most likely reflective of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular
 joints are noted bilaterally, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities at the lung bases most likely reflective of
 subsegmental atelectasis.
