                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and abnormal sounds at the left
 lung base.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  On the lateral view diagonally oriented opacity along
 the fissure likely represents an area of plate-like atelectasis. 
 Additionally, there is a hazy opacity present in the right peripheral midlung.
 The lungs are otherwise clear without lobar consolidation.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis as described above; right midlung opacity
 better characterized on chest CTA performed on the same day.
