                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Stage II breast CA on dose dense
 chemotherapy with fever to 102 at home, cough, and SOB, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia. There is a rounded opacity inferior to the right posterior
 ninth rib, which likely reflects rib overlap. The cardiomediastinal contour is
 normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Surgical clips are seen
 overlying the right lower chest. A Port-A-Cath ends in the proximal right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia.  A rounded opacity inferior to the right
 posterior ninth rib likely represents rib overlap however, if pneumonia is of
 high clinical concern, oblique views can be obtained to further localize this
 finding.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 11:08 AM, 60 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
