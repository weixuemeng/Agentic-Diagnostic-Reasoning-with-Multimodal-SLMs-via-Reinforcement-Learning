                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Carcinoma with malignant effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is probably little overall
 change.  Extensive effusion with volume loss and possible pleural metastases
 again seen on the right.  Probable pleural metastases and healed rib fractures
 on the left as well.  An area of suggested increased opacification in the left
 upper zone could possibly represent a superimposed consolidation.
 
 There is an unusual appearance to the distal clavicle, which may reflect a
 previous fracture with some bony resorption.  The acromioclavicular joint is
 essentially within normal limits.
