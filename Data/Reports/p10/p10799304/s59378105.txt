                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post spinal surgery who now presents for
 evaluation of a new oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and CT
 torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been significant interval development of a large
 right-sided pleural effusion layering along the right lateral pleural surface.
 There also appears to be increased opacification of the right lung which may
 be secondary to layering fluid. In the context of the increased opacification
 of the right lung, a new focal consolidation cannot be excluded. The left lung
 also demonstrates increased peripheral opacities which may be secondary to
 atelectasis given their development in the last three days, however an
 infectious etiology cannot be ruled out.  The left lung volume is low.  The
 heart size is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Significant interval development of a large layering right-sided pleural
 effusion.  In the context of the background opacification of the right lung,
 any focal consolidation of infectious etiology or otherwise cannot be ruled
 out.
 
 2. Interval development of peripheral left mid-lung focal opacities.  This may
 be secondary to atelectasis; however, again a left-sided focal infectious
 consolidation cannot be ruled out.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:30am by Dr. ___
 ___ by telephone on the day of the exam.
