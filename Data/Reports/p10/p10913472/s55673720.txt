                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female transferred from outside hospital with
 pneumonia and respiratory failure.  Assess line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent portable chest radiograph on ___
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube, left approach central
 venous catheter, and nasoenteric catheter are in expected position.  Dense
 consolidation of the right lung with associated large pleural effusion is
 consistent with clinical history of pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. 
 Consolidation in the left base may reflect an additional focus of infection. 
 Bilateral hilar prominence may be secondary to reactive adenopathy or vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard expected position of support devices.
 2.  Large right lung consolidation and associated effusion.  Possible
 additional consolidation in the left lower lobe.  Reactive adenopathy likely.
