                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube reposition.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:01 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube remains 2 cm above the
 carina with the chin in the neutral position and should be retracted to ovoid
 bronchial intubation.  Right and left internal jugular catheters end in the
 mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube ends below the diaphragm but the tip is out of
 view.  Otherwise, there is no change from the prior study with opacification
 of the right hemithorax.  Left basilar opacification is also similar.  The
 left upper lung zone is clear.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded from
 view, but there may be a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina with the chin in
 neutral position and should be retracted to avoid bronchial intubation in the
 event that the chin goes down.
