                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:15 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube is low, ending 1.5 cm above
 the carina with the chin in neutral position and should be retracted to avoid
 bronchial intubation.  Right and left internal jugular catheters end in the
 mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube follows the expected course, going below the
 diaphragm but the tip is out of view. The esophageal manometer has been
 removed. Otherwise, there is no change from ___ at 5:15 a.m., in right
 lung opacification and left basilar opacity.
