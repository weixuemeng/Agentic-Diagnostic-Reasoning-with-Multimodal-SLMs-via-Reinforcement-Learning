 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Large body habitus
 and underpenetrated technique somewhat limits evaluation for subtle edema. 
 There is no large consolidation to raise concern for pneumonia.  Mild edema
 may be present.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild interstitial edema.  Otherwise, unremarkable. 
 Limited exam.
