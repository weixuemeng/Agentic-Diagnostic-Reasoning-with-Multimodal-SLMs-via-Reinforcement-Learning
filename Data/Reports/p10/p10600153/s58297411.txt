 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

 blood count.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Widened mediastinum is unchanged.  Left lower lobe
 retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, most likely atelectasis but superimposed
 infection cannot be totally excluded.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion.  ET tube tip is 7 cm above the
 carina.  Left subclavian catheter  is in standard position
