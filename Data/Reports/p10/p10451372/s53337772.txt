                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low limiting assessment. Bibasilar opacities may
 represent atelectasis.  Coarsened reticular markings are noted with mild hilar
 prominence which can be seen in the setting of pulmonary interstitial edema.
 The possibility of underlying fibrotic lung disease is not excluded. No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size cannot be assessed. The
 mediastinal contour is stable with aortic atherosclerotic calcifications again
 noted.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
 evidence of prior kyphoplasty in the upper thoracic spine with multiple
 compression fractures in the thoracic spine appearing stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with probable mild interstitial edema.
