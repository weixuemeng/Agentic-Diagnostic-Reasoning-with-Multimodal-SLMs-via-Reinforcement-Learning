 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  History of prostate
 cancer.

 lateral view.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 There is mild dextroconvex curvature of the thoracic spine and mild anterior
 wedging of at least ___ mid thoracic vertebral bodies.  Recent bone scan on ___ demonstrated increase tracer uptake in the right first anterior

 assessed on the present exam, on which the ribs are under penetrated for
 better visualization of the lungs.  Internal fixation hardware is partially
 visualized in the proximal right humerus.
