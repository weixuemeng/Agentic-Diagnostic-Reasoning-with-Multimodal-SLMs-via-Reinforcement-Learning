 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV and PNA  // interval change?
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation due to pneumonia has grown more radiodense.
 There is no cavitation as yet.
 
 Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, in this patient with severe emphysema
 suggesting the new opacification in the right lower lobe could be dependent
 edema rather than a second focus of pneumonia, but careful imaging followup is
 indicated. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Heart size is normal.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the right atrium.
