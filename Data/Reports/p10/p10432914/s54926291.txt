                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough for several months, rule out pulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged marked
 cardiomegaly with marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, better appreciated
 on the lateral than on the frontal film.
 
 Areas of retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.  Also unchanged is a minimal
 parenchymal scar in the left lung, as well as mild bilateral apical
 thickening.  The lung parenchyma shows no evidence of acute disease such as
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No lung nodules or masses.
 
 The lateral radiograph shows a wedge-shaped deformity of a thoracic vertebral
 body, likely reflecting vertebral body compression.  This is unchanged in
 severity since a previous T-spine, chest x-ray from ___.
