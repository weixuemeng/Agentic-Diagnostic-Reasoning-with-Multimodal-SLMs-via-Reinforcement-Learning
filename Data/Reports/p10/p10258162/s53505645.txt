                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Unresponsive episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating 1 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2.5-3 cm for more optimal
 positioning.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.  There is left base
 retrocardiac opacity and subtle increased opacity projecting over the left
 lung which may be due to layering pleural effusion.  Left base atelectasis or
 consolidation is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified.  The bones are
 osteopenic.  Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulder joints, partially
 imaged.  There appears to be external artifact that overlies the right
 hemithorax.  A left-sided PICC terminates high in position, in the region of
 the left subclavian vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low-lying endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 1 cm above the
 level of the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by 2.5-3 cm.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included
 on the image.  Left PICC line is high in position, terminating in the region
 of the left subclavian vein. The above findings were discussed with ___
 on ___ at 11:30 a.m. via telephone, 5 minutes after discovery.
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacity and increased haziness of the left hemithorax
 may be due to layering pleural effusion.  Left base atelectasis and/or
 consolidation not excluded.
