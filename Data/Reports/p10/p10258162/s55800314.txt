 and mediastinal contours are stable.  The bilateral diffuse lung opacities
 appear stable and could reflect an underlying pneumonia.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  There is likely a small left effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.

 fracture fragments.  Bones are osteopenic.  No acute bony abnormality is
 appreciated.  No pneumothorax.
