                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the level of the carina. 
 The left PICC ends in the low SVC, as before.  Mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema has minimally improved.  Dense left retrocardiac opacification is not
 significantly changed, likely atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is
 not significantly changed.  A small layering right pleural effusion is also
 not significantly changed.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A displaced fracture of the
 proximal right humerus is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, not significantly changed.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 
 3.  Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis, not significantly changed.
