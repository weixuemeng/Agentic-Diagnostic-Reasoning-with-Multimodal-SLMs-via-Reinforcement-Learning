 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned along the midline. 
 Dense retrocardiac opacification is not significantly changed, consistent with

 not significantly changed.  The right lung is clear.  There is no right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Aortic calcifications are noted. 
 A right-sided rib deformity is unchanged.  An old fracture of the proximal
 right humerus is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in partial left lower lobe collapse or
 probable small left pleural effusion.
