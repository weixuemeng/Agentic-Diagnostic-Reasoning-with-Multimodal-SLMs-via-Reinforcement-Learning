                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left-sided
 chest tube is again seen, extending into the medial left upper hemithorax, may
 be encroaching on the mediastinum, and coils distally.  A moderate left
 pneumothorax remains.  Extensive subcutaneous edema is seen along the left
 chest wall.  Left retrocardiac opacity is seen.  Given differences in
 technique, the right paratracheal mediastinum is less prominent as compared to
 the prior study.  Right base atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 Displaced mid left clavicle fracture is seen.  Left sided rib fractures seen
 on study earlier today were better appreciated on that study.
