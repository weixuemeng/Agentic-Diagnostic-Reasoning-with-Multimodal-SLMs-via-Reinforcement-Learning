 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 23:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post fall, assess pneumothorax for
 resolution.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 21:28.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 23:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval decrease in subcutaneous emphysema involving the left lateral soft
 tissues.  Left chest tube remains in place with its tip coiled at the apex,

 of the left lower lobe.  Overall, when compared to the prior study of

 differences in positioning between studies. Right lung is grossly clear.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
