                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged. The aortic arch is partly calcified. There
 is similar slight relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Streaky
 opacity suggests minor atelectasis in the lingula, little if at all changed.
 There is a nodular focus projecting over the left costophrenic angle possibly
 a nipple shadow. Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted along the mid thoracic spine, as before,
 including large anterior osteophytes along several adjacent levels.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Small nodular focus projecting along the right costophrenic sulcus,
 possibly a nipple shadow.
 
 When clinically appropriate, repeat PA view without and with nipple markers is
 suggested to reassess.  An email regarding the follow-up recommendation was
 sent to the ED QA nursing group.
