                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the right base laterally with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle.  This could merely reflect pleural fluid and atelectasis.  However, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could be a manifestation of acute
 pneumonia or pulmonary embolism with infarct.
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with left ventricular prominence and there
 is no evidence of vascular congestion.
