                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with dyspnea, status post right thoracentesis, concern for
 PE, chest x-ray for VQ scan.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There are multiple areas of opacification in the right lung base.  The right
 pleural effusion has improved though a small amount of pleural fluid persists.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Multiple areas of focal opacity at the right lung base, likely secondary
 to loculated pleural fluid and pleural thickening.
 
 2.  Interval improvement in right pleural effusion.
