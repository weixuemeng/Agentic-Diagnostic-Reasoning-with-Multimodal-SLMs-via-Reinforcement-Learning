                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver injury with right effusion and pigtail catheter.
 
 FINDINGS:  With the pigtail catheter on waterseal, there is no definite
 pneumothorax.  The degree of a pleural effusion has decreased.  There is some
 relatively new opacification at the left base, consistent with some
 atelectatic change and probable effusion.
