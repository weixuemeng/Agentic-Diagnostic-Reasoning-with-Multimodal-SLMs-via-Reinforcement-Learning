                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
  
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter has been placed within the lower
 right hemithorax with associated evacuation of the previously large right
 effusion.  Moderate right lateral and basilar pneumothorax is new.  Improving
 aeration in right middle and lower lobes with residual partial atelectasis
 remaining.  On the left, there is worsening retrocardiac opacity which
 probably reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although
 coexistent pulmonary infection is also possible.
