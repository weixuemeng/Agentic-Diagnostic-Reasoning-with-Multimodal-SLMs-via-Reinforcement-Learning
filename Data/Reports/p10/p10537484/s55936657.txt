  Right basal pneumothorax is not well seen on this examination and may have
  resolved with unchanged right basal pleural pigtail and decrease in medial
  right lower lung atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity is decreased with improved
  left lung aeration on the whole. Small bilateral effusions are unchanged or
  improved.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place.  Right basilar
 pneumothorax on prior study has been partially replaced by a small pleural
 effusion, but there remains evidence of a small pneumothorax laterally in the
 right mid lung.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present with interval improvement in
 the left retrocardiac region.  Small left pleural effusion has also apparently
 decreased in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small right pleural effusion and decreasing right lateral
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis with interval improvement on the left.
