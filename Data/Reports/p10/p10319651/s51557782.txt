                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Newly diagnosed metastatic lung cancer and recurrent
 aspiration.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is progression of the left and right lower lung opacities that might
 reflect progression of infectious process versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 The more focused left upper lung consolidation is highly concerning for
 infectious process.  Bilateral pleural effusions potentially minimally
 increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 pacemaker appearance are stable.
