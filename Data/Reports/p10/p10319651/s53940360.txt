                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with acute on subacute hypoxia, pneumothorax
 or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest from ___ at 9:28 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right pleural pigtail catheter and left-sided pacer remain in place. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There continues to be a left
 pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity which may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia also should be
 considered.  There has been interval appearance of a more streaky linear
 opacity at the right base, favoring subsegmental atelectasis, although again
 aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  There has been interval appearance of minimal peribronchial
 cuffing which may represent mild interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Contrast remains seen within the visualized colon.
