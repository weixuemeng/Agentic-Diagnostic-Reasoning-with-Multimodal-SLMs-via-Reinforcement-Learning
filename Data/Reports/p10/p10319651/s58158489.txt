                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post thoracentesis with spontaneous
 oxygen desaturation, question pneumothorax, recurrent effusion, worsening
 opacities.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer and right pigtail pleural catheter remain in place. 
 There is interval improvement in aeration at the right lung base, with overall
 decrease in size of the pleural effusion.  There is a stable left pleural
 effusion with associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in patient positioning and rotation between
 studies.  Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion with no
 evidence of pulmonary edema on the current study.  Residual contrast is seen
 within the visualized colon.
