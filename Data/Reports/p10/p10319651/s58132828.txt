  New bibasilar opacities, worse on the left. Pulmonary vascular congestion and
  probable bilateral pleural effusions.   These findings are concerning for
  pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. Recommend short interval followup
  after treatment to document resolution.  If symptoms are not compatible with
  pneumonia, recommend chest CT for further evaluation.

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, expected location.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged. There are new increased retrocardiac and right lung base
 opacities, worse on the left. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. There
 are stable left costophrenic sulcus changes likely due to scarring and pleural
 thickening. There are however, probable new bilateral pleural effusions. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION: New bibasilar opacities, worse on the left. Pulmonary vascular
 congestion and probable bilateral pleural effusions.   These findings are
 concerning for pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. Recommend short
 interval followup after treatment to document resolution.  If symptoms are not
 compatible with pneumonia, recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
