  compared to the prior radiograph lung volumes are lower.  There has been
  increase in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, worse on the
  right.  Prominence of the interstitium likely represents pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with bilateral pneumonia and aspiration.  Please assess for
 pneumonia, effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-chamber pacemaker with two leads in right atrium and anterior
 right ventricle. Interval increase in bilateral moderate sized pleural
 effusions, right greater than left.  Interval worsening of bilateral opacities
 likely due to aspiration pneumonia with no interval change in calcified
 pleural thickening on the left.  Heart size is obscured by pleural effusion. 
 Mediastinal contour and hila are normal.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions;
 worsening bibasilar opacities, likely due to aspiration pneumonia.
