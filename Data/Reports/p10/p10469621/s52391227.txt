                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 12:35 p.m.
 
 A right IJ catheter is present.  It appears to represent a Swan-Ganz catheter,
 slightly different in position compared with the earlier film as the tip
 previously pointed rightward at the origin of the right pulmonary artery and
 now points slightly leftward.  The previously seen ET, NG tube, mediastinal
 drains, and left chest tube have been removed.  
 
 Sternotomy wires and prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette again noted. 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Elevated left hemidiaphragm is similar or slightly more pronounced.  Small
 left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion noted.  Apparent
 abandoned epicardial pacing leads noted.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of multiple lines and tubes.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter, as described.  Bibasilar atelectasis, possibly slightly worse at the
 left base.
