                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RML PNA  // f/u PNA      f/u PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 The region of consolidation seen on the lateral view ___ and
 attributed to right middle lobe pneumonia has improved but not cleared.  There
 is persisted radiodensity on the frontal view projecting lateral to the right
 heart which could be in the right lower lobe.
 
 Overall lungs are hyperinflated due to emphysema or severe small airways
 obstruction.  Heart is top- normal size, following median sternotomy and
 coronary bypass grafting.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal, there is no edema
 or pleural effusion.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Because the lung abnormality on ___ has not
 entirely cleared and because it is nature and precise location are unclear to
 me, I think the patient should return in 4 weeks for PA, lateral and oblique
 views of the chest to see if there is any indication at that time for chest CT
 scanning.
