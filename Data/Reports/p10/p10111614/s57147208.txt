                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough for two months.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again in the left upper lobe/lingula there are parenchymal
 opacities; however, in comparison to prior radiographs this appears to have
 slightly increased.  While this could represent a increase in the patient's
 known fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis, an overlying infectious process
 should be considered in the correct clinical setting.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left upper lobe/lingular opacities concerning for
 either progression of the fibrosis or infectious process in the correct
 clinical setting. Either post treatment radiograph can be considered to
 evaluate for resolution, or a CT to evaluate for interval progression of the
 disease in the absence of clinical symptoms of pneumonia.
