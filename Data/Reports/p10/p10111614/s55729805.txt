                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS wedge resection x3 (RUL/RML/RLL)  // ?
 interval change/lung expansion/interstitial opacities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiographs obtained 1 day prior, right lung parenchymal
 opacities located at wedge resection sites have decreased in extent.  Small
 right pleural effusion.  Bilateral interstitial opacities are unchanged since
 at least ___, better appreciated on recent CT chest dated ___.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable without pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is gaseous distention of the
 visualized colon.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving postoperative changes adjacent to wedge resection sites in the right
 lung.  Gaseous distention of the visualized colon may reflect a postoperative
 ileus.
