                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male status post fall with left-sided rib pain.  Assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous opacity with air bronchograms in the left lower lobe.
 Cortical irregularity of lateral left sixth and seventh ribs may represent rib
 fractures. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion and right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible left rib fracture at lateral sixth and seventh ribs.  If clinical
 concern may consider detailed rib views with focal findings marked.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis. Although unlikely this may represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
