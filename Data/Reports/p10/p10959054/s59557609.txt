 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, chills, not feeling well.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 small right pleural effusion with some fluid seen tracking in the minor
 fissure and which may be partially loculated.  Scattered patchy opacities
 projecting predominantly over the right lung raises concern for an infection,
 less likely asymmetric edema.  There is left basilar atelectasis.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are relatively stable.
