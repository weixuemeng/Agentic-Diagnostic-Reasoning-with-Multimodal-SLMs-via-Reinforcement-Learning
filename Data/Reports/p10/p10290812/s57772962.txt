                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New triple-lumen central line, right subclavian.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:57.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left.  There has been interval
 placement of a right subclavian central venous catheter terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  At least two of the sternal wires are fractured, also on
 the prior.  Medial left-sided vascular stent is again seen.  Overall, there
 are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis persists.  Lateral left lower
 lobe opacity, most likely represents atelectasis, although an early
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion is seen.
