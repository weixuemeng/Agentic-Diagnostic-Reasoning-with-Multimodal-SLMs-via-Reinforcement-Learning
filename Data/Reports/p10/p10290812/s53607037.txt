                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath in a patient with pulmonary edema and
 a history of retroperitoneal bleed and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior
 studies.  A right-sided PICC line ends in the lower superior vena cava.  A
 left-sided vascular stent projects over the medial portion of the left
 clavicle.  Median sternotomy wires are intact and relatively aligned.  The
 mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis
 have improved compared to the most recent prior, but persist.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
