 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The

 sternal wires are fractured. Medial left side vascular stent is again seen. 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC.  Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis persists but appears somewhat improved.  Again seen is an opacity
 projecting over the left upper hemithorax, to the left of the aortic knob,
 likely representing summation of shadows, including the anterior aspect of the
 left first rib.  No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Basilar atelectasis is again seen.
 2.  Interval decrease in previously seen pleural effusions.
