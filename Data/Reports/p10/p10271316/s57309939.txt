                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrated marked elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Right lung base opacities likely represent atelectasis. 
 Left lung is essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The aorta appears tortuous with calcifications.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Compression deformity of T4 vertebral body is noted.  Vertebroplasty changes
 involving T11 and L1 vertebral bodies are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity
 responsible for right lower lobe collapse.
 
 2.  Compression deformity of T4 vertebral body of uncertain chronicity.
