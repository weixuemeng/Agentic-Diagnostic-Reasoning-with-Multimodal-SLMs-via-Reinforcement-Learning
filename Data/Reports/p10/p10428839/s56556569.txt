 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ETT pls assess placement  // History: ___M with
 ETT pls assess placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carinal. A nasogastric tube ends in
 the stomach. The lung volumes are very low which causes crowding of
 bronchovascular structures and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified. Considering patient positioning,
 the mediastinum is likely normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very low lung volumes. Appropriate lines and tubes.
