                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malignant ascites with hypoxemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with
 basilar opacification, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Left
 hemidiaphragm is sharply seen.  No vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
