                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bulging mediastinum projecting over the left main
 bronchus and aortopulmonic window could be due to fat deposition exaggerated
 by low lung volumes.  I would recommend a repeat frontal chest radiograph at
 full inspiration to see if this is a real finding.  Lower lungs are grossly
 clear, though there is vascular crowding.  In the upper lobes, there is the
 suggestion of emphysema.  Lateral view shows tiny right pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is normal.
