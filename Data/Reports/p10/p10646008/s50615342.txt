                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, concern for bulging mediastinum, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On today's radiograph, the appearance of the mediastinum is normal.
 There is a suggestion of pulmonary emphysema in both upper lobes.  In
 addition, better visible than on the previous examination, a linear opacity at
 the bases of the right upper lobe that is better visible on the frontal than
 on the lateral film.  This structure could represent a small pulmonary nodule
 with adjacent parenchymal reaction or a localized atelectasis.  Given that the
 lesion was not visible on the previous examination two days ago, atelectasis
 is the most likely possibility.  To confirm, a repeat chest radiograph should
 be performed within four weeks from now.
 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses on the lateral image, probably
 caused by lesser inspiration than on the previous examination and a small
 degree of pleural fat.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Unchanged normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
