                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a tortuous aorta.  An air-fluid level in the upper esophagus
 likely reflects esophageal contents.  The lungs are clear of consolidation. 
 Flattened hemidiaphragms and a large AP distance are compatible with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A lower thoracic wedge deformity is stable compared to the ___
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Air-fluid level in the upper esophagus but no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
