                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible neutropenia with cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax is unchanged compared to
 the prior exam with leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  Clips are seen within the right axillary region.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion, right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.  Cholecystectomy
 clips are re- demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures, unchanged, and likely due to a combination of
 malignancy and collapse.  Infection, however, is difficult to exclude.
 Resolution of previously noted right basilar opacity.
