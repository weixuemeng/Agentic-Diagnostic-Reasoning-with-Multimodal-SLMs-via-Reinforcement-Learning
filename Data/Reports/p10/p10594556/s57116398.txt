                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CT showing pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was compared to CT scan from
 earlier the same day.
 
 Dense left basilar opacity is compatible with combination of left lower lobe
 collapse and parenchymal opacities in the left upper lobe.  Left pneumothorax
 is demonstrated, both superiorly and at the lung base and along the
 mediastinum.  Right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unremarkable, although shifted to the left.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided pneumothorax as seen on prior CT scan.  Dense left
 basilar opacity compatible with left lower lobe collapse and opacity in the
 left upper lobe as well.
