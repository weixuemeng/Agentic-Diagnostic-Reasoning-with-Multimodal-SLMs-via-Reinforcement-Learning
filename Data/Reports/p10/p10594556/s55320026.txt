                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known lung carcinoma, now with cough for seven days and low-grade
 temperature with increased shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, the most recent radiographs dated
 ___ and review of PET-CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Loculated pleural effusion is increased with
 increased pleural thickening at the left apex and along the left mediastinal
 contour.  There remains dense opacification at the left base; however, there
 is now a retrocardiac air fluid level suggestive of necrosis/cavitation in the
 lung mass.  There is new patchy opacity with air bronchograms extending from
 the left hilum throughout the left lung which has the appearance of infection.
 No pneumothorax is present.  The right lung is clear.  Surgical clips are
 noted along the right lateral chest wall.
