                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy, to assess lower lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Extensive
 opacification at the left base is again consistent with collapse in the lower
 lobe.  Chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Right lung is essentially clear.
