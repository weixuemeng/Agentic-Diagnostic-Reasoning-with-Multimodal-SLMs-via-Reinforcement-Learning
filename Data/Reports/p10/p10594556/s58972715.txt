                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ AT 7:58 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumothorax status post chest tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 earlier same day at 6:32 p.m.  There has been interval placement of a
 left-sided chest tube seen projecting over left lung base, side port within
 the thoracic cavity.  Overlying subcutaneous gas is identified.  Pneumothorax
 seen at the lower chest on prior has resolved.  There is still subtle lucency
 adjacent to the AP window suggesting persistent pneumothorax, although no
 discrete pleural line is identified.  Right lung remains clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with decrease in size
 of pneumothorax which may persist medially.
