                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with possible left base density.
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest x-ray from earlier the same day and chest x-ray
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and 2 lateral views of the chest.  Better seen on the lateral exam is
 a small area of opacity projecting over the cardiac shadow on both lateral
 views.  There is no definite correlate on the frontal however it may localize
 to the left.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.  No free air is
 seen below the diaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacity best seen on the lateral view projecting over the cardiac
 shadow, potentially localizing to the left.  This was not identified on remote
 prior and may represent atelectasis however a developing infection is also
 possible in the proper clinical setting.
