                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, rule out heart failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There is borderline mild cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone re-distribution
 with mild vascular plethora.  Atelectasis at left base and right cardiophrenic
 angle.  Clips noted over both upper lobes, with some associated pleural
 thickening.  Possible hyperinflation/COPD.  
 
 There is an apparent tubular density superimposed over the lowermost trachea
 and right mainstem bronchus,? iatrogenic. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Findings which could reflect mild fluid overload.  No overt CHF.  
 2) Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 3) ? stent in lower trachea and right mainstem bronchus.
 
 Addendum: Review of OMR yielded the follwing history: tracheomalacia s/p Y
 stent placement s/p 2 days prior (to ___).
 This would account for the tubular density seen on today's CXR.
