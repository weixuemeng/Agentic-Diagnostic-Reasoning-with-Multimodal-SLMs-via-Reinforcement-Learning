                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, new oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  There are left
 greater than right bilateral pleural effusions again seen which appears
 grossly stable to possibly mildly increased on the left, given differences in
 patient positioning.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Evidence of
 scarring/atelectasis is again seen in the right mid-to-lower lung.
