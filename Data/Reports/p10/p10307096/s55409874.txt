                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVR.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with the valve replacement.  Opacification posteriorly
 on the lateral view is probably associated with residual left and also
 possible right pleural effusions.  Atelectatic changes with crowding of
 vessels are seen at the right base.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax.
