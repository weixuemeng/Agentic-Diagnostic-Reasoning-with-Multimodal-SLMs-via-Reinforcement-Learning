                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, all of the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without evidence of vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.  The
 left costophrenic angle shows mild opacification, which could represent some
 residual pleural fluid.
 
 The pneumopericardium seen previously has resolved.
 
 Opacification at the right base medially could reflect crowding of vessels
 related to poor inspiration.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
