 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CTA of the chest.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Minimal opacity at the lung bases

 lungs are clear.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No
 vascular congestion, edema or pleural effusions are evident.  The thoracic
 aorta appears tortuous and the ascending aorta appears mildly dilated. The
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Dilated ascending aorta.
