                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with leukocytosis, subjective fever, and nonspecific GI
 complaints including vomiting, evaluate for pneumonia or aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly limited study due to patient rotation.  Within limitation, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in size.  The thoracic aorta is
 calcified and unfolded, as on prior.  The hila are within normal limits.
 
 There are low lung volumes with crowding of normal bronchovascular structures.
 Patchy opacities at the left more than right lung base have a similar
 appearance to prior studies and likely reflect atelectasis.  O
 
 Therwise, there is no focal lung consolidation.  There is mild prominence of
 vascular markings, but no pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or
 sizable pleural effusion.
 
 Chronic right posterior multilevel rib fractures are unchanged in appearance,
 as is lower thoracic spine kyphotic angulation due to pre-existing thoracic
 spine compression deformities, not well evaluated on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or gross
 effusion.  Mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
