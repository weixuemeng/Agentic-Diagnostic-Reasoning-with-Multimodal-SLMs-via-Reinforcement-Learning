                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate markedly
 decreased lung volumes, accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  The heart is
 normal in size.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.  No confluent
 consolidation is seen to represent infection, particularly given the lateral
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of infection.  Limited frontal view due to
 poor inspiration.  Consider repeat frontal radiograph at full inspiration if
 clinically relevant.
