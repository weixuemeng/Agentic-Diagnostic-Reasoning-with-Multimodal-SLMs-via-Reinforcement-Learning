                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  Lung volumes are low.  There is questionable retrocardiac
 opacity. Minor atelectasis is likely but early developing infection is not
 entirely excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacity in the retrocardiac area, probably atelectasis. Developing
 pneumonia seems less likely but difficult to exclude and the possibility can
 be correlated with clinical presentation.
