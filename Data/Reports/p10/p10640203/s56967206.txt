                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status and BRBPR  // eval for
 infectious process vs. other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 There is also suggestion of faint bibasilar opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis or infection.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the
 lateral view suggests a small pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  Multiple healed right-sided rib fractures are
 noted.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Trace right pleural effusion.
 2. Faint bibasilar opacities, may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia.
