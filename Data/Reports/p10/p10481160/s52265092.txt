  1. Focal opacity occupying the right upper lobe, presumed to be compatible
  with known non-small cell lung cancer.
  
  2. Small right-sided pleural effusion not significantly changed since prior
  chest CT from ___. Linear lucency at the right lung base appears to
  be below the diaphragm, and could relate to a small amount of free air for
  prior intervention in ___. However clinical correlation is advised.
  
  3. Left lung is clear. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, weakness on chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.
 Question pneumonia and or other intrathoracic process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT intervention from ___ and  chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal opacity occupying the right upper lobe is again seen, reflecting known
 non-small cell lung tumor. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion which
 does not appear significantly changed from prior chest CT. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no new focal
 consolidation.  A curvilinear lucency several cm below the right hemidiaphragm
 likely reflects a small amount of bowel gas.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right upper lobe opacity, likely reflecting known non-small cell lung
 cancer.
 2.  Small right-sided pleural effusion not significantly changed since prior
 chest CT from ___.
 3.  No superimposed consolidation.
