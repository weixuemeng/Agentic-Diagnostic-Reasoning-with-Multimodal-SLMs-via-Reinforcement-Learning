                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia after fluids, crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New perihilar and right basilar ill-defined alveolar opacities with vascular
 indistinctness is compatible with interval development of moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar focal opacities also raise concern for developing
 aspiration.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Left-sided AICD device leads are
 in unchanged positions.  Median sternotomy wires and CABG clips are again
 noted.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of moderate pulmonary edema.  More focal bibasilar
 opacities raise concern for aspiration.
