                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 18:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.5 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Moderate pulmonary edema appears
 slightly worse in the interval with increased perihilar and right basilar
 alveolar opacification.  More focal consolidative opacities in the lung bases
 raises concern for superimposed aspiration.  There is continued moderate
 cardiomegaly.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Remainder of the examination is unchanged.  There is re- demonstration of
 remote left-sided rib fractures.  There is mild gaseous distension of the
 stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.  Slight interval
 worsening of moderate pulmonary edema.  More focal consolidative opacities in
 the lung bases raises concern for superimposed aspiration.
