                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting after fall.  Rule out fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The imaged portions of the lungs are clear other than probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  Prominence of the right
 peritracheal soft tissue is likely from venous structures.  The thoracic aorta
 is slightly tortuous and/or ectatic.  The thoracic spine is mildly to
 moderately curved to the right.  Degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular
 joints are mild.  No evidence of a pleural effusion or pneumothorax on limited
 frontal supine views.  No definite focal consolidation.  Obliquely oriented
 opacities projecting over the left heart may be chondrocalcinosis.
 
 This exam is not dedicated for imaging of the bones.  Dedicated rib films
 should be obtained if there is clinical concern for fracture with a BB marker
 placed on the area of focal exam findings.  Slight irregularity of the left
 lateral lower rib could indicate fracture, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 This exam is not dedicated for imaging of fractures.  Irregularity of the left
 lower lateral rib could be fracture.  Correlate with focal exam findings. 
 Dedicated rib films would be obtained with BB marker in the area of focal pain
 if clinically indicated.
