                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP semi-erect upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with severe dementia presenting with
 unresponsive episode of 50 minutes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright semi-erect portable views of the chest were obtained. 
 Per the radiology technologist, this is the best image possible due to the
 patient being frozen at fetal position with shifting to the left.  The
 technologist used a pillow to tried to straighten the patient.  Patient is
 confused and does not follow directions.
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Apparent blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may relate to overlying pericardial fat pad versus a
 pleural effusion.  Definite focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due to patient rotation.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Consider repeat with better positioning when patient able.
