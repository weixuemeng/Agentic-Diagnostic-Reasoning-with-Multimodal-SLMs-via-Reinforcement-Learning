                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Positive PPD, severe burns, question evidence of tuberculosis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.  I
 suspect the presence of some bullous change at the lung apices.  However, no
 fibronodular scarring or apical retraction is identified.  Within the limits
 of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary
 nodules, or calcified lymph nodes are detected.  Osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2.  No radiographic evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis is detected.
 3.  Suspect bullous change at both lung apices.  If clinically indicated, this
 could be further assessed with chest CT.
