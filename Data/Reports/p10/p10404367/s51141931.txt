                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of B-cell lymphoma, on
 chemotherapy, now with fatigue and hallucinations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A venous catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 mild cardiomegaly.  There is no longer a mild diffuse interstitial abnormality
 but persistent opacities are noted at the lung bases with reticulation;
 scarring or interstitial lung disease could be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute process.  Findings raising concern for possible
 underlying mild interstitial disease at the lung bases versus persistent
 scarring or atelectasis.
