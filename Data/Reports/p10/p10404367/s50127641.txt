                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma with methotrexate, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a vague area of
 increased opacification at the left base that could represent a developing
 consolidation.  The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged except for
 poor definition of the left heart border, which also could indicate a lower
 lung consolidation.
