                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with polytrauma s/p ETT adjustment  // ETT
 position s/p adjustment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is positioned approximately 8 cm above the carina.  Per
 discussion with the ICU nurse, the endotracheal tube was subsequently Re
 ingested in position more distally.  The patient is currently asymptomatic. 
 There is an unusual rounded air density projecting over the mediastinum, just
 distal to the endotracheal tube.  No clear cause for this is identified and it
 was not present on the earlier study.  The lungs are grossly unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is now positioned approximately 8 cm above the carina
 however per report, the tube has subsequently been ingested.  A 2 cm locule of
 air projecting over the mediastinum is of unclear etiology.  Recommend repeat
 chest radiographs to evaluate for any interval change.
