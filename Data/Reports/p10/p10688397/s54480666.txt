                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with traumatic L thigh laceration w/ ongoing HD
 instability  // ETT position, interavl change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An apparent slight increase in the right basal pleural effusion is likely due
 to dependent a layering.  An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates
 approximately 5.5 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasoenteric tube is
 in-situ, the tip is not visualized but lies below the left hemidiaphragm. 
 There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Prominence of the bilateral hila
 and moderate cardiomegaly suggests a degree of congestive heart failure but no
 frank pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax seen.  Apparent widening of the
 superior mediastinum is similar when compared to prior studies and likely
 related to the AP supine technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in the right pleural effusion likely due to dependent
 layering.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
