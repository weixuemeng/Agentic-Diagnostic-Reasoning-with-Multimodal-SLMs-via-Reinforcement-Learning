                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cancer, syncope, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided demonstrating left
 chest wall Port-A-Cath with tip residing in the low SVC.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  A subtle nodular opacity
 projects over the left lower lung between ribs 8 and 9 posteriorly which could
 represent a nipple shadow, though a true pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded. 
 Consider repeat study with nipple markers.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No pneumothorax or effusion.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung may represent
 a nipple shadow.  Recommend repeat radiograph with nipple markers.
