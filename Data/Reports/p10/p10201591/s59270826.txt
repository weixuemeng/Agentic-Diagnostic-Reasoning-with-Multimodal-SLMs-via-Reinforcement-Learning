                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF THE EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of aspiration, pleural
 effusion on exam, now very dyspneic.  Evaluate for effusion versus aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Cardiac enlargement as before.  Bilateral hazy
 densities over the bases are again observed and consistent with previously
 made diagnosis of bilateral pleural effusion fluid accumulations in the inter-
 lobar fissures, although lateral view not obtained in this repeat study.  New
 discrete parenchymal infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia cannot be identified.
