                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Six to eight weeks of intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. 
 The mediastinal contour also is slightly widened due to the low lung volumes,
 but otherwise appears unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.  Evaluation of lung bases
 is slightly limited due to the low lung volumes, with presence of minimal
 streaky opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is otherwise noted.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which limits assessment of lung bases.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.
