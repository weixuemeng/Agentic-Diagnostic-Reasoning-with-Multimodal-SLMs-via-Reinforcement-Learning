                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided rib fractures at level
 ___ 9 through ___.  Reevaluate rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  There is
 a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and
 posteriorly but no evidence of left atrial enlargement.  Thoracic aorta
 unremarkable for age.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs
 of acute pulmonary infiltrates are present.  There is a mild blunting of the
 left lateral pleural sinus extending into the posterior area on the lateral
 view, but no other pulmonary abnormalities or pleural findings can be
 identified.  No gross skeletal abnormalities are seen.  The patient's
 radiographic records are reviewed.  Trauma series followed by torso CT of
 ___ demonstrated mildly displaced fractures in the ninth through
 twelfth ribs on the left side close to the articulation with the vertebral
 joints.  It is impossible to demonstrate the subtle changes on plain PA and
 lateral chest examination.  Most likely the residuals of a mild pleural
 effusion or scar formation as seen now can be related to this trauma. 
 Assessment of the previously identified rib fractures would require dedicated
 radiographs and preferentially a CT examination.
