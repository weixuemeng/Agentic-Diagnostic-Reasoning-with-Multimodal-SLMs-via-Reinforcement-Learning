                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.  No evidence of pneumothorax, acute
 pneumonia, or vascular congestion.  On this study and the prior one, there
 appears to be some narrowing of the tracheal air column at the level of the
 clavicles.  This raises the possibility of true tracheal narrowing.  If there
 is no clinical explanation for this appearance, CT of the trachea could be
 considered.
