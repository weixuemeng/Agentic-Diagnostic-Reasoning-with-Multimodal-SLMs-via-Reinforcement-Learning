 Please evaluate for interval change      Please evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 02:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest film ___ at 05:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. Right internal jugular port-a-cath and endotracheal tube are
 unchanged in position. There continues to be a stable hazy opacity at the
 right apex.  Unchanged patchy and streaky opacities at both lung bases could
 reflect areas of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
 More focal nodular opacity in the right mid lung likely corresponds to the
 presumed pulmonary contusion seen on the CT dated ___.  No
 pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Old left-sided rib fractures again seen.
