  Endotracheal tube in stable position. A new nasogastric tube ends in the
  stomach. Increased opacity in the right lung apex could represent patient
  positioning as well as hemorrhage or aspiration. No pneumothorax. ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with likely aspiration event requiring intubation
 // ? PTX after attempted R IJ placement      ? PTX after attempted R IJ
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14 17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 18 56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and side
 port projecting over the stomach. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains
 in place with its tip in the distal SVC.
 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is increasing
 opacity at the right apex which may be related to patient positioning although
 other processes such as pleural or parenchymal hemorrhage, atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia should be considered. This can be further assessed on
 followup imaging. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
