                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with likely aspiration event  // ? acute change  
 ? acute change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18 56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 03:01 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular Port-A-Cath are
 unchanged in position although the tip of the nasogastric tube cannot be seen
 on this study.  There is hazy opacity again noted at the right apex which does
 not appear to be significantly changed and could reflect some loculated
 pleural fluid/hemorrhage, partial upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
 Clinical correlation is advised. Streaky opacities in the retrocardiac region
 most likely reflect patchy atelectasis.  More focal nodular opacity now
 appreciated in the right mid lung may correspond to the presumed pulmonary
 contusion seen on the CT dated ___, less likely aspiration. 
 This can be assessed on follow up imaging.  Left ___ and ___ posterolateral
 old rib fractures.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
