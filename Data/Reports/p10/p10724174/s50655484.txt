                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LOC now hypoxic requiring intubation, bronch
 and NGT placement  // new NGT; post bronch     NEW OG TUBE PLACEMENT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid body of the stomach. Otherwise,
 little change. The increased opacification at the left base most likely
 reflects atelectasis, low in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
