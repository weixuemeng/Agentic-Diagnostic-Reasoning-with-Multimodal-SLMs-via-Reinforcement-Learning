                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 patchy opacity projecting over the right lateral upper lung, worrisome for
 infection, less likely aspiration.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lateral right upper lung opacity is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
