                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Relative hyperlucency of the upper
 lungs compared to lung bases suggests underlying emphysema.  Prominence of the
 bibasilar interstitium, right greater than left, may reflect chronic changes
 exaggerated by lower lung volumes; however, given background emphysema
 superimposed mild edema cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax present.  Mild apical thickening is not significantly changed
 compared to ___.  Redemonstration of surgical segmental resection of fifth
 right rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of bibasilar interstitium on the background of chronic
 lung disease may be exaggerated by low lung volumes, though superimposed mild
 edema cannot be excluded.
