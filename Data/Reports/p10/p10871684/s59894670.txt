                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old female with cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Multifocal opacities in
 the left lung, some quite nodular, is most likely multifocal pneumonia, but
 needs followup radiographs to exclude other concurrent diagnoses.  Vague
 heterogeneous opacity overlying the right lower lung may also represent small
 consolidation.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal pneumonia involving the left lung and possibly the right lower
 lobe. Follow up CXR needed in 4 weeks to document substantial clearing in
 order to exclude other conditions.
