                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe AS, PNA, concern for aspiration with
 worsening hypoxemia  // pulm edema, pna, worsening of pulm effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 21:09
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there is minimal interval change in cardiomegaly,
 mediastinal contours, lines as well as parenchymal opacities. The right lung
 appears to be more involved than left. The consolidation is slightly more
 asymmetric than on the prior study and does either worsening of interstitial
 process or superimposed infection in the right lung are possibility.
 Correlation with chest CT would be justified at this point
