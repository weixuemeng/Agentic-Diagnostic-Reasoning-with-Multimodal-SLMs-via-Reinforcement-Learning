                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to reduced lung volumes and soft tissue
 attenuation.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Streaky opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis,
 and no focal consolidation is demonstrated.  A 14 mm nodule in the right upper
 lobe is unchanged, and similar to that seen on the CT chest from ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat limited assessment of the lung bases due to low lung volumes and soft
 tissue attenuation.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
