                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Patient body habitus causes some underpenetration. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected on this limited
 single view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study without evidence for acute process.
