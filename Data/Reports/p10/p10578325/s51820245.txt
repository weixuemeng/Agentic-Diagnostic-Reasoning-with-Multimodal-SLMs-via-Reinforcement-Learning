                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided chest pain  // ?fx ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited secondary to patient body habitus.  Lung volumes are low
 leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  As compared to the
 most recent prior examination dated ___, there has been no
 significant interval change.  There is no lobar consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax identified.  A subtle, 1.5 cm nodular opacity is
 again noted overlying the right upper lung.  The heart is top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  1.5 cm right upper lobe nodular opacity has been present radiographically
 since at least ___.  Chest CT would be helpful for more complete
 characterization.
