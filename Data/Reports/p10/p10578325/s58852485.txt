                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP, upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:05.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiology technologist indicated that the patient is morbidly
 obese; resulting in poor quality imaging, which includes backscatter radiation
 artifacts apparent on the AP radiographs from the detector itself.  Frontal
 and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Due to patient body habitus,
 the lateral views are suboptimal.  Additionally, square shaped areas of
 density/lucency is seen projecting over the right and left axilla and the lung
 apices represents detector due to patient body habitus per the radiology
 technologist.
 
 No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to patient body habitus, as above.  Given
 this, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
