                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain radiating to left arm and jaw.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Exam is limited by soft
 tissue attenuation.  Low lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, especially at the lung bases.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  
 Repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for
 more complete evaluation of the lung bases when the patient's condition
 allows.
