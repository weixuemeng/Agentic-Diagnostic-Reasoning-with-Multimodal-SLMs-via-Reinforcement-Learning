                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The interstitial markings are prominent, consistent with mild
 vascular congestion.  Evaluation of the lung bases is limited due to
 underpenetration, though no focal opacity is identified.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The known nodule in the right upper lobe is likely
 obscured by overlying ribs on today's exam.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion.
