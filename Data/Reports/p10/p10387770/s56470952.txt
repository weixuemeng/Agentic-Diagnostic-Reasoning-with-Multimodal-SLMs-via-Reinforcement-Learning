 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged from the preceding study.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine with bridging marginal osteophyte
 formation and loss of intervertebral disc height.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
