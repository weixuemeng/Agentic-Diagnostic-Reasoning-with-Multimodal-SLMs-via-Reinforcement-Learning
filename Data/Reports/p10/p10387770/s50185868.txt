 Right pleural drainage tube still in place.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion persists, with both anterior and posterior
 components that may be isolated from the drainage tube.  Rightward mediastinal
 shift indicates considerable atelectasis in the right lung.  Left lung well
 expanded and clear.  Tiny left pleural effusion is probably not clinically
 significant.  Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured in the right hemi
 thorax, not grossly enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
