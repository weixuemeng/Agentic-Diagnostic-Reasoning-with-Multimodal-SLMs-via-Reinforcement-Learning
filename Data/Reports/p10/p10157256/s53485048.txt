                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, a very small right
 apical lateral pneumothorax has slightly increased in size.  Additionally, on
 the lateral view, there is now a loculated hydropneumothorax anteriorly in the
 retrosternal region.  Left chest tube is unchanged in position and there is
 only minimal residual left apical pneumothorax, substantially smaller from
 ___.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in the
 postoperative period, and bilateral perihilar opacities appear similar
 allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study.  These are substantially
 improved; however, compared to ___.  In the setting of basilar
 septal lines, this likely reflects resolving edema.  Small pleural effusions
 are present bilaterally, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in small right pneumothorax following chest tube
 removal.  This finding has been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at
 4:15 p.m. on ___.
