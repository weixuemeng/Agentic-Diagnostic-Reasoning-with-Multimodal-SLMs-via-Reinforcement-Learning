                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post AVR, follow up right pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax is grossly unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, have improved on the
 left.  Bilateral chest tubes remain in place.  Sternal wires are aligned. 
 Patient is status post AVR.  Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion has
 improved.  Diffuse sclerotic bones are again noted.  Left pneumothorax is less
 conspicuous than before.
