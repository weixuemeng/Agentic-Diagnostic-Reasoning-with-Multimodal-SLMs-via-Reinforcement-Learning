                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ONE PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST.  Compared to most recent
 study, there are lower lung volumes.  The right chest tube has been removed. 
 A right pneumothorax is slightly larger laterally, the apical portion of the
 pneumothorax is unchanged.   A small left apical pneumothorax is slightly
 bigger.  Left chest tube is in place.  Increase in perihilar opacities and
 interstitial markings consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.  Increase in
 right lower lobe atelectasis with a slight elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Unchanged diffuse
 sclerosis of the bones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Right lateral pneumothorax is slightly bigger.  Small left apical
 pneumothorax is slightly bigger.
 
 3.  Increase in right lower lobe atelectasis.
