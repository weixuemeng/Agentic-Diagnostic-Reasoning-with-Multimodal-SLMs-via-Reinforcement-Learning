                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Re-positioned tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right lower
 lobe collapse is cleared after bronchoscopy with some residual opacification. 
 Right costophrenic angle is now sharply seen.  Monitoring and support devices
 are essentially in good position.
