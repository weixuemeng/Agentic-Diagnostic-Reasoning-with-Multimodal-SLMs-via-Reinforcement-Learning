                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with rhabdomyolysis and renal failure as well as
 respiratory failure.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  The
 endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of field of view.  A right-sided
 central venous catheter tip terminates at the upper-to-mid SVC.  The heart
 size is exaggerated by positioning and low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  The lung volumes are low with bibasilar
 consolidations likely representing atelectasis.  The aerated portions of the
 lung demonstrate pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Overall, the
 appearance is similar to prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of pulmonary edema with ET tube 5 cm from the
 carina.
