 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with azygoesophageal recess
 contour suggesting subcarinal lesion on prior chest radiograph.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable on this radiograph.  No
 abnormality on the lateral view demonstrated to suggest abnormal contour. 
 Patient is in vascular engorgement but no overt edema.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 The current examination does not demonstrate mediastinal abnormality.  When
 patient condition allows, correlation with formal PA and lateral view would be
 recommended.
