                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with recurrent cough, possible etiology for cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is two PA views, one of them shows a 9 mm left basilar nodularity, which
 is too low to be the nipple and on the other view, this could represent only
 superimposed vessel.  The remaining of the exam is unremarkable.  
 
 Suggest repeating a PA view just to make sure the left basal nodularity is not
 persistent.  
 
 The results have been posted to the radiology dashboard for direct
 notification of referring physician.
