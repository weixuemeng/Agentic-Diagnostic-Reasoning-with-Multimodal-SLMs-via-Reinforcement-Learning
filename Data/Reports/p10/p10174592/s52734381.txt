                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hepatitis C, status post two
 liters of IV infusion, now tachypneic.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 pulmonary embolism, questionable CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar studies ___ ___ and the most immediate chest examination obtained 14 hours earlier
 during the same day.  The on next previous study identified acute interstitial
 and pulmonary edema pattern has markedly improved.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement persists.  On the other hand, the amount of pleural effusion
 accumulating in the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses has increased
 slightly.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.  When
 comparison is extended to the chest examination ___ ___, mild cardiac
 enlargement persists.  The on previous examination identified parenchymal
 density in the periphery of the left upper lobe lingula abutting the cardiac
 contour is again seen and suggests a possibility of an inflammatory process in
 this area.  Thus, further followup is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of acute pulmonary central and interstitial edema
 occurring within the last day.  Development of slightly more prominent
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Peripheral density in left lingula still
 present, deserving further followup.
