                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hepatocellular carcinoma, now presenting
 with fever and mild leukocytosis.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is increased
 interstitial pulmonary edema which is now moderate.  Additionally, there are
 bibasilar opacities which likely reflect a combination of edema and effusions.
 However, relative increased density within the right base as compared to the
 left may be secondary to early pneumonia.  Close interval followup is
 recommended.  A previously described lingular opacity is obscured on the
 current examination.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mildly enlarged
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with probable bibasilar
 pleural effusions.  Relative increased density of the right lung base as
 compared to the left could reflect an early developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.  Close interval followup is recommended.
