                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, status post surgery. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia, CHF or free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The study is
 somewhat limited by patient body habitus. Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding. Bilateral lower lobe opacities which have a somewhat
 linear component may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia is not completely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No other consolidation is seen.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Heart size is normal. The
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for low lung
 volumes.  There is no  pneumothorax. There is no free intraperitoneal air.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe opacities are likely atelectasis, but may
 represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
