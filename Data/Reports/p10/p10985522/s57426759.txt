                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for
 accentuation by AP and apical lordotic technique.  A nonspecific left
 retrocardiac opacity has substantially improved since the recent study, but a
 patchy right lower lobe opacity has worsened.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions have also increased in size slightly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, improved on the left and worse on the right.
 This is most likely due to atelectasis, but aspiration or aspiration pneumonia
 could produce a similar radiographic appearance.
 
 Slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
