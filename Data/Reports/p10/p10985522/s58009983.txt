                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-described known
 right lower lung opacity is unchanged in extent and severity.  On the left,
 the opacity is slightly increased in extent.  Part of this increase could be
 caused by retrocardiac atelectasis.  No parenchymal opacities have newly
 appeared.  As determined in the previous report, the opacities are suspicious
 for pneumonia.
 
 The lateral radiograph shows no relevant change in extent of the known
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The aspect of the cardiac silhouette as well as
 the hilar and mediastinal contours are constant.
