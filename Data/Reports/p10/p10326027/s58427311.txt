                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // ? CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates several median sternotomy
 wires which appear intact.  Surgical clips project over the left mediastinal
 border.  An aortic valve prosthesis is noted.  Progressed relative to prior
 examination are bilateral patchy opacities predominantly in a perihilar and
 lower lobe distribution most consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary
 edema.  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles likely reflects small
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe pulmonary edema progressed relative to prior examination. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
