                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There
 are bibasilar opacities most likely due to atelectasis; however, infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting, particularly at
 the left lung base.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild compression of an
 upper upper-to-mid thoracic vertebral body, stable since the prior study.
