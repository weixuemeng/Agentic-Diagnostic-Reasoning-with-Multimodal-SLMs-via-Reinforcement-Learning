                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain, epigastric pain radiating to the back. 
 Please evaluate for acute abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The base of the left lung demonstrates irregular opacities.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity at the left lung base is of unclear etiology. 
 Could represent atelectasis, peripheral lung infarction from an pulmonary
 embolus. An acute infectious process such as a viral etiology cannot be
 excluded.
