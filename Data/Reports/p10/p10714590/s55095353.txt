                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Side and back pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as more recent CT
 torso examination dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is again a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The lung volumes
 are low.  The stomach is mildly distended with air including an air-fluid
 level.  There is patchy left basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis, but
 otherwise the lungs appear clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Degenerative changes along the thoracic and visualized
 upper lumbar spines are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity is suggestive of minor atelectasis. 
 Mild gastric distention.  Moderate similar degenerative changes, but
 substantial along the thoracolumbar spine.
