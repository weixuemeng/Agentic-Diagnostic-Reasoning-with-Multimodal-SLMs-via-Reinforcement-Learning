                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with seizures.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lung volumes are seen.  That said,
 there increased bibasilar opacities.  There is no large pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes on frontal exam contributing to crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  Increased conspicuity of bibasilar opacities which
 could represent atelectasis although superimposed infection would be difficult
 to exclude.
