                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Question
 infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 accentuating cardiomediastinal silhouette which is likely within normal
 limits.  Minimal tortuosity is present along the thoracic aorta, with arch
 calcifications.  There is mild peribronchial cuffing and interstitial
 opacities which could represent atypical infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is no confluent consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural
 effusion.  Small amount of dependent atelectasis is present in the left base. 
 Diffuse osteopenia is present, allowing for which no compression fracture is
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Peribronchial cuffing and interstitial opacities could represent
 atypical infection although not specific.
