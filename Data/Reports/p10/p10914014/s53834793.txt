                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and oxygen requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears at least mild to moderately enlarged, but exact size is
 difficult to determine given the presence of a moderate to large left pleural
 effusion. There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic
 arch.  Left basilar atelectasis is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is present.
 Degenerative changes are seen involving both acromioclavicular joints as well
 as throughout the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with moderate to large left pleural effusion and left
 basilar atelectasis.
