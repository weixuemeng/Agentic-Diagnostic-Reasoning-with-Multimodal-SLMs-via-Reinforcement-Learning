                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILMS, ___ AT 10:46
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post type A dissection with repair,
 evaluate for effusion.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 10:58.
 
 AP semi-upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted ___ at
 10:46.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative appearance to the
 mediastinal and cardiac contours in this patient status post aortic dissection
 repair.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC,
 unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low with bilateral layering pleural effusions
 and associated airspace opacity which most likely reflects compressive
 atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There
 has been interval improvement in the interstitial edema where there continues
 to be perihilar fullness and evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension.  Clips
 in the right axilla suggest prior axillary surgery.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine with no obvious vertebral
 compression fractures.
