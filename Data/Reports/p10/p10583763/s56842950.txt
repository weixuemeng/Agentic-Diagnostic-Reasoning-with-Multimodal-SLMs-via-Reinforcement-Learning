 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding. No focal

 thoracic aortic aneurysm following repair of aortic root dissection. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged, for with mild pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires
 intact.  Surgical clips project over the right apex. Included upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
