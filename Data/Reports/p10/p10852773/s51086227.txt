                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, with new fever of 101 and new rhonchi on exam. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are ill-defined hazy opacities in
 the right medial lung base.  There is opacification at the right costophrenic
 angle, likely represent a small parapneumonic effusion.  A equivocal small
 opacity in the left upper lateral lung could be artifactual from summation of
 densities.  There is a ___ x 8 mm left perihilar nodular opacity.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right medial basilar consolidation, suspicious for right lower
 lobe pneumonia.  Adjacent small to right pleural effusion.
 
 Rounded opacity adjacent to left hilum, which could be vascular or may
 represent a juxtahilar lung nodule.
 
 Recommend PA and lateral chest radiograph to further assess these findings
 when the patient's condition permits.
