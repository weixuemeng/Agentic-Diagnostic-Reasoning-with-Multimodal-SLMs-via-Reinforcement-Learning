                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Previously
 questioned nodular opacity in the left juxtahilar region and peripheral
 opacity in left upper lobe are no longer evident.  Within the right lower
 lobe, there has been rapid improvement of opacity medially at the right base,
 but there has been no substantial change in the presence of a small to
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Small left pleural effusion is also evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly improving right lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis or
 aspiration.  Small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
