                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but similar.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are relatively unchanged with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta again noted. 
 The imaged thoracoabdominal aorta appears diffusely calcified.  Patchy
 ill-defined opacity in the right lung base is concerning for aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Left lung is grossly clear with the exception of mild left basilar
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, though assessment
 of the right apex is obscured by overlying soft tissue.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized that acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar patchy opacity concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs are recommended to assess for resolution of this finding.
