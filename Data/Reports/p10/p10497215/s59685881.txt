                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough.  Study requested to rule
 out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is top normal in size. There is tortousity of the aorta.
 There is a large heterogeneous opacity at the right lower lung laced with air
 bronchograms and partially obscuring the diaphragmatic interface. Can not rule
 out an associated pleural effusion. Apical thickening of the pleural margins
 is worse on the right and could be residual of prior infection.  The upper
 lobes are otherwise essentially clear. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  
 
 Short radiographic followup is recommended within six to eight weeks and after
 treatment to document interval resolution.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 11:36 a.m., at the time of discovery.
