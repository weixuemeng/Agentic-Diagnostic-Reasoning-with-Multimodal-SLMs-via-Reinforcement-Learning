                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new AFib, shortness of breath,
 question pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with patient
 positioned upright.  In comparison with prior chest radiographs and chest CT,
 there is improvement in scattered opacities seen on prior exam with
 near-complete resolution.  There are coarsened interstitial markings which
 could represent component of fibrosis.  No new consolidation is seen.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Patient rotation limits evaluation of the
 mediastinum.  The heart size appears grossly stable and top normal in overall
 size.  The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in previously noted scattered pulmonary
 opacities.  There is a probable component of fibrosis likely accounting for
 interstitial coarsening.
