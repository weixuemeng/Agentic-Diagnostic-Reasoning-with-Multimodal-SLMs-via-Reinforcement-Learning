 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, exacerbation, evaluation for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities
 have markedly improved.  However, signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 are still present.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mild atelectasis at the lung
 bases, but no evidence of larger pleural effusions.
