                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.  Evaluate for infiltrate
 or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there has been development of bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, worse on the right, with congestion of the central vasculature as
 well as the appearance of some Kerley B lines on the right.  There is a
 moderate right pleural effusion and possibly small left pleural effusion. 
 These findings suggest that the etiology is most likely asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, worse on the right.  However, underlying infection, particularly in the
 right upper and lower lobe cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings most compatible with moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse
 on the right; however, underlying infection is difficult to exclude,
 particularly in the right upper and right lower lung.
 
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.
