                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup lung opacities, question amiodarone toxicity.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies chest x-ray and CT from ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is increase in mediastinal fat.  Small
 bilateral effusions are larger on the left side, unchanged from prior studies.
  
 Extensive bilateral diffuse, ill-defined opacities largely in the upper lobe
 are unchanged. Differential diagnosis still includes asymmetric edema with
 co-existent infection, much less likely amiodarone toxicity.
