                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, respectively, which is unchanged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged allowing for differences in
 technique including mild cardiomegaly.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  An interstitial abnormality appears similar to perhaps mildly
 increased.      
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, perhaps mildly
 increased, but otherwise no significant change.
