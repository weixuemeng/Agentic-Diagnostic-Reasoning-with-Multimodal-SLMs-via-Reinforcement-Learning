                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated and nasogastric tube placement,
 check position.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 12:52.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 14:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  Two left chest tubes and a third catheter are seen overlying
 the left hemithorax.  There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation with
 probable associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  The right lung
 is grossly clear, although the right costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included on the study.  A left subclavian central line has its tip in the
 proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
