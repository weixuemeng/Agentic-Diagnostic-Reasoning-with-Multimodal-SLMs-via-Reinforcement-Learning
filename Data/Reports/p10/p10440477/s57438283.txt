                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of MVC status post chest tube placement.  Please evaluate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed at 12:17 on the same day as well as a
 CT chest performed at 06:00 on the same day. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine exam of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube.  The
 tip of a chest tube terminates at the mid left lung on the ___ view.  Again
 the lung volumes are low which limits assessment of the lung parenchyma
 however note is made of mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion otherwise the cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  The previously noted
 rib fractures are not well visualized on this exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study given low lung volumes.  Interval placement of a
 left chest tube which appears to terminate in the mid left lung. No ptx.
