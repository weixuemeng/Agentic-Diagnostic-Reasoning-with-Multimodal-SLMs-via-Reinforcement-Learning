                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and chills.  History of metastatic
 renal cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as more recent
 CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  A left suprahilar mass appears similar allowing
 for differences in technique.  A large right upper lobe nodule also appears
 unchanged.  Band-like opacity in the right middle lobe is compatible with
 minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with a similar degree of metastatic disease
 as evaluated on radiography, with no evidence of acute disease.
