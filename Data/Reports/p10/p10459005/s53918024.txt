 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ICD pocket hematoma, please localize pocket
 wires and assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest demonstrate left-sided pacemaker device,
 left-sided dual-lead ICD device with leads projecting over the expected
 locations of the atrium and ventricle and changes from prior CABG.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart remains mildly
 enlarged and somewhat globular in configuration. Radiography is not sensitive
 for evaluating for pacemaker associated fluid collections.
