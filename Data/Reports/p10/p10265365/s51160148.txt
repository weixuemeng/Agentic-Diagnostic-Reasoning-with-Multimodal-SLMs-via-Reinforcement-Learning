                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right-sided chest pain.  Question
 cardiomegaly or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation.  There is, however, small, new
 right-sided pleural effusion.  There has also been enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  There is a suggestion of a right apical nodule.  This is unlikely
 to represent a bone island as it was not seen on prior.  Elsewhere, lungs are
 clear.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small right-sided pleural effusion.
 2.  Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 3.  Right apical nodule for which apical lordotic view is suggested.
