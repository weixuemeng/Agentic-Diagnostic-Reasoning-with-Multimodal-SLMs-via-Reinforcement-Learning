                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been almost complete
 clearing of the opacification in the retrocardiac region.  The residual most
 likely represents atelectatic change.  No evidence of vascular congestion and
 the right lung is clear.
 
 Intact sternal wires are again seen and there is mild tortuosity of the aorta.
