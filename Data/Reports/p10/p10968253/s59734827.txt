                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fluid overload and tachypnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Bilateral perihilar and lower
 lung regions of consolidation are seen.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 particularly on the right suggests superimposed effusions.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged and despite differences in technique and low
 inspiratory effort, has increased in size since ___.  Aortic valve
 replacement is identified as well as median sternotomy wires.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is seen at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema and probable bilateral right greater
 than left effusions.  Please note that superimposed infection cannot be
 entirely excluded, and repeat can be performed after diuresis.
