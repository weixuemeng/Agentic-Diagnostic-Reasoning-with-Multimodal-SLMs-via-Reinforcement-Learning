                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with episodes of dizziness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 clear of consolidation or effusion.  Calcific density projects over the left
 upper lung adjacent to the aortic arch.  Nodular density is seen in the right
 mid lung laterally.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Single-lead pacing device is identified with a right ventricular lead.  Median
 sternotomy wires are noted.  Atherosclerotic calcification identified at the
 aortic arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular opacity in the right
 lung laterally,  potentially a lung nodule.  Correlation with older films
 suggested to document stability, otherwise, chest CT may be performed to
 further characterize.
