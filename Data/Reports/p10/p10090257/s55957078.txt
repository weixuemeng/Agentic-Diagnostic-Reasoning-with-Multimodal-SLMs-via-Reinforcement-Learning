                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs.  The lungs are well expanded.  Peribronchial
 opacification in the left lower lobe is more likely due to bronchial
 inflammation than pneumonia.   Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal and pulmonary
 vascular engorgement are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Possible left lower lobe bronchitis, less likely mild pneumonia.
 
 2. Vascular engorgement could be due to mild congestive failure and/or volume
 overload or a hyperdynamic circulation due to febrile tachycardia.
