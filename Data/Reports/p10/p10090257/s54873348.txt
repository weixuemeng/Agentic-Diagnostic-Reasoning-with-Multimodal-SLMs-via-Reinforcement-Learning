                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Mild cardiomegaly,
 mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggest volume overload and/or
 mild biventricular decompensation.  Mild scarring or chronic atelectasis is
 still present at the left lung base.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild biventricular decompensation. LLL scarring or atelectasis more likely
 than pneumonia.
