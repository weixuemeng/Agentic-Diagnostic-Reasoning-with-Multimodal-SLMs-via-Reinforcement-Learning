                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis, evaluate for mass or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ at
 outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Dense
 vascular calcifications within the aortic arch are without evidence of
 dissection or aneurysm.  The lungs are hyperinflated, but there is no relative
 lucency of the upper lobe parenchyma to suggest large bullae due to underlying
 emphysema. Surgical clips project over the soft tissues of the right chest
 wall.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clear lungs.  If continued concern for mass or pulmonary
 hemorrhage, could be further assessed with CT. Possible underlying emphysema.
