                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:14 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with feeding tube placement, check
 location.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:35.
 
 Portable AP chest film dated ___ at 11:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube is now coiled within the distal esophagus with
 the tip positioned in the mid esophagus.  Repositioning is advised.  The
 patient's nurse, ___, was notified of the need for repositioning at 11:50
 a.m.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Lung volumes remain low.  Retrocardiac opacity with associated air
 bronchograms is stable and may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable given portable
 technique and differences in positioning between studies.
