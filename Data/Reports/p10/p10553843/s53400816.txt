                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old status post trach.  Check feeding tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 11:14.
 
 A portable AP chest film dated ___ at 11:15 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube now courses below the diaphragm with the tip not
 completely visualized, but likely within the stomach.  The tracheostomy tube
 is unchanged and is in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Lung volumes remain low with a more focal patchy opacity at the left base,
 which could reflect atelectasis although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
