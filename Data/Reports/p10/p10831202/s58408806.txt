                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS: None.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Allowing for low lung volumes, vague lower
 lung opacities are probably due to minor atelectasis.  The right shoulder is
 not fully imaged, but there is an indication that the acromion may be
 depressed with respect to the right clavicle, although the appearance may be
 essentially a projectional artifact.  Bony structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or chest injury.  Mild apparent
 relative depression of the right acromion with respect to the distal right
 clavicle; if pain refers to the site and there is a clinical possibility of
 shoulder separation, then dedicated radiographic assessment could be
 considered.
