                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease and altered mental status.  Evaluate
 hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains stably enlarged with minimal increase in right
 greater than left perihilar/basilar predominant opacities.  Distention of the
 azygos vein suggests volume overload favoring asymmetric edema.  No large
 pleural effusion is evident.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal interval increase of right greater than left perihilar/basilar
 predominant opacities likely representing asymmetric pulmonary edema although
 underlying infectious etiology given the appropriate clinical situation cannot
 be excluded.
