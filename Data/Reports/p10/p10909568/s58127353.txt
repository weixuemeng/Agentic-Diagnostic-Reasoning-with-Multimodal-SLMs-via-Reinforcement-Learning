                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lower extremity cellulitis with new chest pain. 
 Please evaluate for widened mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is mild stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 There is stable right greater than left perihilar/basilar predominant
 opacities.  Mild distention of the azygous vein would favor asymmetric edema. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. 
 The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Stable right greater than left perihilar/basilar predominant opacities likely
 representing asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an underlying infectious
 etiology, in the appropriate clinical situation, cannot be excluded.
