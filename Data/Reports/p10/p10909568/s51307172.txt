                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is diffuse increase in interstitial
 markings bilaterally, similar as compared to the prior study which may be due
 to pulmonary edema superimposed upon emphysema.  More confluent opacity
 projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung is seen which could relate to
 fluid overload; however, an underlying consolidation due to infection is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although some trace pleural
 effusions are difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally raises
 concern for pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema.  More confluent opacity
 in the right mid-to-lower lung, underlying consolidation due to infection is
 not excluded.  It is difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.  Consider
 repeat after diuresis for further evaluation.
