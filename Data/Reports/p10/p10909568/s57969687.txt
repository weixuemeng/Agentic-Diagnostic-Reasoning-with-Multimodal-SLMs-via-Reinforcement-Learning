                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bleeding duodenal ulcer.  Concern for perforation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors from ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  The patient has been extubated in
 the interim.  The right-sided PICC has been removed.  The lungs remain clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of
 pneumoperitoneum.  Tiny granuloma in the right upper lobe is stable. Possible
 bibasilar interstitial fibrosis is difficult to assess on a portable
 radiograph, and a standard PA and laterl CXR is recommended when clinically
 feasible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
