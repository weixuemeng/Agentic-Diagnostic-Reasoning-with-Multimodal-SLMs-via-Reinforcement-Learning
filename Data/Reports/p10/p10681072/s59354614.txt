                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post recent Whipple, now with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are noted.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The heart size is normal.  The
 descending aorta is slightly tortuous.  A Port-A-Cath tip projects over
 mid-to-distal SVC.  Several surgical clips project over upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
