                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, elevated lactate,
 unclear source
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Endotracheal tube has
 been slightly withdrawn, but remains low lying with tip approximately 1.5 cm
 from the carina.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter and enteric
 tubes are in unchanged positions.  Mild enlargement of the heart is re-
 demonstrated with left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  Lung volumes are low.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is overall improved from the previous exam, and may
 reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  A probable small left
 pleural effusion appears unchanged.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is
 clearly identified.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube has been slightly withdrawn, but tip remains low lying,
 terminating approximately 1.5 cm from the carina.
 2. Improved retrocardiac opacity which may reflect atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded with probable small left pleural effusion.
