                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p intubation  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed same date, ___ approximately 4
 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Initial portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 within the right mainstem bronchus.  Repeat AP radiograph through the chest
 demonstrates the distal tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 1 cm above
 the level of the carina.  An enteric tube is identified descending the thorax
 in uncomplicated course, its tip which projects over the left upper quadrant
 in the presumed location of the gastric lumen.  Gas distended loop of
 transverse colon is identified projecting over the right upper quadrant.  A
 port is identified, its catheter tip which projects over the anticipated
 location of the low superior vena cava.
 
 Lung volumes are low with opacification at the left lung base likely secondary
 to partial collapse of the left lower lobe in the setting of right mainstem
 bronchus intubation.  No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is seen.
 The heart border is obscured.  There is no large pneumothorax.  Probable small
 left pleural effusion.  Osseous structures are without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Initial radiographs demonstrate intubation of the right mainstem bronchus with
 repeat radiographs demonstrating the positioning of the endotracheal tube
 currently 1 cm above the level of the carina.  For more appropriate placement,
 recommend retraction approximately 2 cm.
 
 Opacification of the left lower lobe with volume loss and leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures most compatible with partial left lower lobe collapse
 in keeping with right mainstem bronchus intubation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated to the ordering physician ___. ___
 by ___ ___ via telephone at ___:50p on ___ at time study was
 reviewed.
