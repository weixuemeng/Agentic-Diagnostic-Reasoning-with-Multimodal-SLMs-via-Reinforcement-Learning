 and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present. There are moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
