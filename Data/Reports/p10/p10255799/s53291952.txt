                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F with massive hiatal hernia. Now p/w SOB, tachy to 110s
 and new O2 requirement.  // please eval for PNA, hiatal hernia location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  O AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the radiograph obtained 3 days prior, there has been interval removal of
 an ET tube and nasogastric tube, the large hiatal hernia is more clearly seen,
 and there is worsening of homogeneous opacification at the inferior right
 hemithorax. This is probably due to a combination of a moderate right pleural
 effusion and atelectasis associated with the hiatal hernia.  A small left
 pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis appear unchanged.  No clear
 consolidation is identified.  A left-sided PICC terminates within the upper
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged large hiatal hernia with an increased, adjacent, moderate right
 pleural effusion associated with atelectasis.  The left pleural effusion and
 left lower lobe atelectasis appear grossly unchanged.
