                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L PTX, L pigtail  // Chest tube to waterseal
 at 9:30
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the left-sided pigtail catheter.  The catheter configuration is
 slightly different compared with the prior study, though overall positioning
 is similar.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  No gross left effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits, allowing for minimal surrounding
 atelectasis.  The left paratracheal soft tissues and aortic knob are within
 normal limits on the current study.
 
 The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF.  Focal infiltrate, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 Left mid clavicular fracture again noted.  Alignment is grossly anatomic on
 this view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left pigtail catheter overall similar position, but slightly different in
 configuration.  No pneumothorax or gross left effusion detected.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation again noted, similar to the
 prior study.
 3. Left mid clavicular fracture again noted.
