                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic elbow joint, now cough and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Allowing for this, there is probable cardiomegaly.  The
 aorta is mildly unfolded.  There is dense opacity at the right base, which
 appears to consist of a small- to moderate-sized joint effusion and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation, with air bronchograms, suggestive of a
 pneumonic infiltrate.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base with a
 small left effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Opacity at the right base, highly suggestive of a pneumonic infiltrate
 with associated small-to-moderate right effusion.
 2.  Very s,mall left effusion with left base atelectasis.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Possible background hyperinflation/COPD.
 4.  Upper zone redistribution; doubt overt CHF.
