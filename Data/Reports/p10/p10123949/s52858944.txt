                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left chest tunneled hemodialysis/pheresis catheter. Multiple
 median sternotomy wires are re- demonstrated.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes.  Linear opacities at the lung bases
 are consistent with atelectasis.  There is a chronic interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality most conspicuous at the lung bases.  There is no focal lung
 consolidation, however subtle superimposed infectious process is difficult to
 exclude given underlying lung abnormalities.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, however
 it is difficult to exclude underlying pneumonia given background interstitial
 abnormality and bibasilar atelectasis.
