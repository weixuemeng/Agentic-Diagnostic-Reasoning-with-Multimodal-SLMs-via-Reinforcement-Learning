                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with recent pneumonia and failure to extubate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina, as before, but
 without knowing the position of the head and neck, it is not possible to
 determine whether this needs repositioning.  The enteric tube courses below
 the diaphragm and curves to the right of the spine, likely in the distal
 stomach.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A right PICC line has
 been removed from ___.  The lungs remain mildly overinflated without focal
 consolidation.  A small right pleural effusion is present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged.  Healed right rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Slightly hyperinflated but clear lungs with small right pleural effusion.
