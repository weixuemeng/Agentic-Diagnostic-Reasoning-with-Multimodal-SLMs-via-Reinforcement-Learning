                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema is
 present as well as nonspecific patchy and linear areas of opacity at both lung
 bases, most likely due to atelectasis.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful to exclude infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
