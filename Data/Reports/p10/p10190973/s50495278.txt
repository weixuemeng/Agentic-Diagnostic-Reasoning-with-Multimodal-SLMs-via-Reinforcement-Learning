                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:46 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure, altered mental status and
 heart failure after intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 8:46 a.m.:
 
 The patient has been reintubated, tip of the new tube is at the level of the
 sternal notch, 5.4 cm from the carina.  Positioning is standard, but if there
 is serious concern about self extubation, tube could be advanced roughly 1.5
 cm.  Mild peribronchial opacification in the lower lobes is probably mild
 atelectasis or recent aspiration.  Subsequent chest radiograph, 7:45 p.m.
 available at the time of this review shows that the lower lungs have largely
 cleared, so this should not raise concern for developing pneumonia.
 
 No mediastinal widening, cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement,
 mediastinal widening, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion to suggest heart
 failure.
