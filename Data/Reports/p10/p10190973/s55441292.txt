                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress requiring intubation, here to evaluate for
 pulmonary edema and ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study is available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating below the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and sideport in the proximal
 stomach.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  A coronary stent
 projects over the left border of the heart.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  Prominence at the right paramedian stripe appearing relatively
 lucent on radiography likely represents prominent mediastinal vessels.  A
 small right pleural effusion may be present.  No significant hemothorax is
 seen on this single supine view.  Hazy airspace opacities in the right middle
 and lower lung zones with smaller airspace opacities in the left mid lung zone
 may reflect atelectasis.  The pulmonary vasculature is essentially within
 normal limits.  Healed right lateral rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube with tip 3.5 cm above the carina.
 2.  Hazy airspace opacities in the right middle and lower lung zones, greater
 than the left, are non-specific, possibly atelectasis, though aspiration or
 infection are not excluded.
