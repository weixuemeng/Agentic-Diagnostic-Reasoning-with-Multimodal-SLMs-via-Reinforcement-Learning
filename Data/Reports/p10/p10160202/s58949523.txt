                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxemia, now intubated and with OG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, 4:32 through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval placement of an ET and OG tube.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 5.9 cm above the carina.  The orogastric tube is difficult to visualize,
 however the tip is likely in the proximal stomach.  There has been interval
 improvement of bilateral consolidations, likely related to resolving pulmonary
 edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is atelectasis at
 the left lung base. There is redemonstration of elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, which appears chronic in nature. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 5.9 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube is difficult
 to visualize, with tip likely within the proximal stomach and sideport above
 this level; further advancement of the tube is recommended.
 
 2.  Interval improvement of bilateral consolidations, likely related to
 improving pulmonary edema.
