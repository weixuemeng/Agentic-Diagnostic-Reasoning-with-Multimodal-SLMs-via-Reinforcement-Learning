                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Low O2 saturation at PCP's office, assess for acute process
 in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Elevated left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Thoracic kyphotic angulation somewhat limits the
 evaluation to the apices.  However, allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult to assess but
 appears grossly stable.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Clips are
 noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
