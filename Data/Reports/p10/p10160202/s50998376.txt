                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with sepsis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 ET tube tip is 6.4 cm above the carina in a standard position.  Cardiomegaly
 and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Increasing opacities in the retrocardiac
 region are consistent with increasing large area of atelectasis, almost
 collapse of the left lower lobe.  Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.  NG
 tube tip is coiled in the stomach.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Small
 right effusion has minimally increased.
