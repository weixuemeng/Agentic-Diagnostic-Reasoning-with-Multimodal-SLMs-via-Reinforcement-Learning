                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 829 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Alzheimer's, urinary sepsis, now with
 increasing oxygen requirements, question edema or consolidation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 829 is submitted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  However, the heart still remains enlarged.  There has
 been interval appearance of mild pulmonary edema.  There are likely layering
 effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than the right, likely
 reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 No pneumothorax.  Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. 
 Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  Right subclavian
 central line is unchanged in position with the tip in the distal SVC.
