                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is mild right basilar atelectasis without
 definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable with the cardiac
 silhouette top normal, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Surgical clips
 are noted over the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with right basilar atelectasis.
