 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There may be a very trace left pleural effusion.  Prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately enlarged.  No pneumothorax is seen.

 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Subtle right base opacity most likely relates to vascular congestion although
 underlying infection is difficult to exclude.
