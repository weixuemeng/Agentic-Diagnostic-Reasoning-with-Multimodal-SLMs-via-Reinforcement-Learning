                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis and pigtail catheter placement, to
 rule out pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Following pigtail catheter placement in the right lower chest, moderate right
 pleural effusion has near completely resolved.  Moderate-to-large left pleural
 effusion associated with left lower lung atelectasis and mediastinal shift to
 the right side is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Obscured left
 mediastinal and the heart borders by pleural effusion limited assessment of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Folowing right pigtail catheter placement, moderate right pleural
 effusion has near completely resolved, whereas large left pleural effusion
 associated with passive collapse of adjacent lung and mediastinal shift to the
 right side is persisting.  No pneumothorax.
