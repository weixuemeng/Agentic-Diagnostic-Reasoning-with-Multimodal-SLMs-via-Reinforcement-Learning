                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a
 right pneumothorax, the gap of the pneumothorax is about 3 cm large.  There
 currently are no signs of tension.  Right-sided pigtail catheter.
 
 On the left, a second pigtail catheter has been inserted.  The catheter
 insertion caused a substantial decrease of the pre-existing extensive left
 pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of left pneumothorax.  The rightward
 mediastinal shift has completely reversed.
 
 Areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
