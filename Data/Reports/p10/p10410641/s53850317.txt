                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous chest x
 ray from ___ and chest ct from ___.
 
 There is a large right lower lung opacity, compatible with pleural effusion. 
 Given relatively mild mediastinal shift to the left, there must be components
 of atelectasis in the right lower and right middle lobes with possible
 superimposed consolidation.  The right upper lobe is grossly clear.  Small
 left pleural effusion is also seen; however, the left lung remains grossly
 clear.  There is a rounded density projecting in the retrosternal clear space
 on the lateral.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess, however,
 is slightly shifted towards the left.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  New large right-sided pleural effusion with underlying
 atelectasis and possible consolidation in the middle and lower lobes.  CT scan
 may offer additional detail of underlying parenchymal abnormalities.  Small
 left-sided pleural effusion.
