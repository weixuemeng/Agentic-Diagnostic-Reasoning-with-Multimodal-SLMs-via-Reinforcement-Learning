 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of pancreatic cancer with
 right pleural effusion status post thoracocentesis.  Evaluate for volume
 overload, effusion or infection.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of
 ___ as well as an AP and lateral chest examination of ___.  The next previous portable chest examination observed mild
 regression of the right-sided pleural effusion following successful
 thoracocentesis was only temporary and fluid effusion has increased again;
 however, not as much as it was on examination of ___.  No new shift of
 mediastinum is identified and no pneumothorax is seen.  No significant cardiac
 enlargement is observed and in the accessible pulmonary vasculature, no
 evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema can be identified.  There is a
 small amount of pleural effusion accessing also on the left base but clearly
 less marked than on the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reoccurrence of right-sided pleural effusion in patient with
 history of pancreatic carcinoma.  No radiographic evidence of CHF, cardiac
 enlargement or fluid overload.
