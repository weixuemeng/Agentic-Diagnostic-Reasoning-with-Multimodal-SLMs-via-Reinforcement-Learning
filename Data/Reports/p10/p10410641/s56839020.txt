                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypertension, rule out infectious process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  When compared to prior, there has been significant interval
 enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions which are now moderate in size. 
 Underlying airspace disease is also possible.  Superiorly, however, the lungs
 are grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given the size
 of effusions.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions
 since prior exam with possible underlying airspace disease not excluded.
