 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest view was read in comparison with multiple prior
 radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral pigtail catheters are present at the lung bases.  Moderate right
 apical pneumothorax has minimally decreased since yesterday.  The maximum
 width at the apex measures 2.4 cm as compared to yesterday measuring 2.7 cm. 
 Opacity at the right lung base which appeared on the yesterdays radiograph is
 more denser and is likely from an aspiration or atelectasis.  Small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.
