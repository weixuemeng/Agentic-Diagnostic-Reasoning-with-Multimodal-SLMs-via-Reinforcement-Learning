                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and known pancreatic cancer.  Recent
 paracentesis.  Question feasibility of thoracentesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:   There is a right pleural effusion, the size of which is difficult
 to ascertain.  There is unchanged bilateral lower lobe and right middle lobe
 collapse.  The small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are not well visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable large right pleural effusion and increasing left pleural effusion. 
 Feasibility of of thoracentesis would best be evaluated with decubitus films. 
 Ultrasound guidance can also be considered.
