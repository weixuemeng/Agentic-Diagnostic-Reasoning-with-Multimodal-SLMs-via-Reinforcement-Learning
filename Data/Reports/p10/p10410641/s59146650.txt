                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent left effusion with catheter placement, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is a Pleurx catheter in
 place.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacification is consistent
 with atelectasis and effusion.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
