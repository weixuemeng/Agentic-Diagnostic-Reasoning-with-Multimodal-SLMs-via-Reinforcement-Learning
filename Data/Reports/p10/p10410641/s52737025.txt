                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided pneumothorax and bilateral pleural effusions with
 pigtail drains.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a stable right
 pneumothorax.  There are several radiodense lesions along the left hemithorax
 that may represent skin folds.  There is no definite left pneumothorax.  There
 is opacification of the left thorax consistent with a moderate left pleural
 effusion.  There is also new engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature in the
 left lung.  There is slight shift of the mediastinum to the right.  Bilateral
 pigtail drains are noted at the costophrenic angles.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left pleural effusion and slight mediastinal shift. Recommend
 obtaining PA expiratory films to exclude a left pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable right pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___.
