                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A mild to moderate interstitial abnormality is most suggestive of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A TIPS shunt projects over the
 right upper quadrant and there are also surgical clips.  In addition
 embolization coils are noted immediately to the right of midline as well as in
 left upper quadrant, all unchanged findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Other etiologies such
 as atypical pneumonia could be considered, however, depending on clinical
 circumstances.
