                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  COUGH. CHRONIC CURTAIN ESOPHAGEAL STRICTURE STATUS POST RECENT
 ENDOSCOPIC DILATATION.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Opacification in
 the right lung has resolved. There is vague increase in interstitial
 opacification of the left lung including small nodular foci in the left upper
 lobe worrisome for a reurrent/chronic infection, new since the prior study.
 Previously, there were few nodular foci in the left mid lung that have
 resolved. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the left lung, notably in the left upper lobe with nodular
 components. The distribution has shifted since the prior study but the type of
 opacification is somewhat similar. This may indicate recurring aspiration as a
 possible etiology in addition the possibilitiy of community-acquired
 bronchopneumonia or atypical infection.
