                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post MVC with hypoxia and wheezing.  C6-C7
 fractures.  Question pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is a more discrete region of consolidation in
 the right lower lobe on the current exam worrisome for development of
 infiltrate or potentially due to aspiration.  Well-defined opacities are also
 seen in the bilateral perihilar regions, similar to prior.  Biapical scarring
 is again noted.  Diffuse dilatation of at least the proximal half of the
 esophagus is noted.  Rounded density in the retrocardiac region is compatible
 with known cyst seen on CT of the chest from ___.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Bilateral perihilar opacities as on prior,
 potentially due to aspiration or chronic lung changes.  Please correlate
 clinically.  Repeat exam after treatment to document resolution of the right
 lower lobe finding.
