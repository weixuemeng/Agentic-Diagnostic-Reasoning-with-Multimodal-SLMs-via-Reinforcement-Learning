                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The main pulmonary artery contour is prominent. Streaky opacities at the left
 lung base suggest atelectasis with increased volume loss since the prior study
 although similar findings were already present but with better aeration. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at the left lung base, probably consistent with increased
 volume loss superimposed on chronic scarring and atelectasis, although an
 infectious process is not excluded.
