                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with C. difficile colitis.  Evaluate for free
 intra-abdominal air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis
 from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild distention of the azygos vein suggests
 mild volume overload.  Unchanged, mild pulmonary vascular congestion without
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Linear densities at the left base reflect
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Small region of nodular opacification at the right
 base is unchanged and may reflect the bronchiolar nodularity seen on the
 recent abdominal and pelvic CT from ___ and possibly a component of
 the remotely aspirated barium seen on both the abdominal and pelvic CT from ___ and prior CT chest from ___.  No evidence of free
 intraperitoneal air, but evaluation is severely limited by semi erect
 positioning.  Recommend repeat upright or left lateral decubitus radiographs
 for more adequate assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air, but evaluation is severely
 limited by semi erect positioning.  Recommend repeat upright or left lateral
 decubitus radiographs for more adequate assessment.
 2.  Stable, bronchiolar nodularity at the right base.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat upright or left lateral decubitus radiographs.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendations were communicated to Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ ___ text ___ on ___ at 12:21 PM, 10 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
