                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Supine frontal portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p placement of chest tube for hemothorax  //
 ?tube placement, ?hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine frontal portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day CTA torso
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a left thoracostomy drain with tip in the left lung
 base.  No radiographically evident pneumothorax is visualized on this supine
 radiograph.  Known manubrial and rib fractures are poorly visualized. 
 Retrocardiac opacity may be due to residual pleural effusion/hemothorax and
 adjacent atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly, as before.  There is a left chest
 pacemaker with electrodes in expected positions.  Aorta is calcified,
 indicating atherosclerosis.
 
 There asymmetric fullness of the right neck, compared to the left, consistent
 with known hematoma.
 
 Again seen are changes compatible with Paget's disease in the right humerus.
