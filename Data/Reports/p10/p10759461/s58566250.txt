 catheter.  This catheter projects with its tip over the right atrium, the
 device could be pulled back by 3 to 4 cm.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Unchanged patient rotation.  There are minimal non-characteristic parenchymal
 scars at the right lung bases and an area of small atelectasis at the left
 lung bases.  These areas are unchanged as compared to the prior image.  There
 is no evidence of additional parenchymal processes and notably no evidence of
 pneumonia.  No larger pleural effusions are present.
