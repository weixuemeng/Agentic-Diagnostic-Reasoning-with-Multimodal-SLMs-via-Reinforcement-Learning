                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are lower lung volumes
 compared to prior study, which exaggerates the size of the heart and the
 interstitial markings.  There is likely bibasilar atelectasis which may be
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  A calcified pleural plaque is again seen
 in the right lower lung.  The aorta is either tortuous or dilated, unchanged
 compared to ___.  There are significant coronary artery calcifications. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and likely bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
