 AP CHEST, 5:40 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and mild hemoptysis after right lower
 lobe transbronchial biopsy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Compared to the preoperative appearance, there is new heterogeneous
 opacification in the right lower lobe extensive enough to render air

 be excluded, but there is no pneumothorax.  Top normal heart size unchanged. 
 No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this image.
