                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Relative upper zone lucency may reflect chronic obstructive
 lung disease or emphysema also noting a suggestion of irregular lung
 architecture.  A fine bilateral retricular abnormality is present in both
 lower lungs.  There is no evidence for focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy bibasilar opacities with fissural thickening, possibly
 representing mild interstitial edema with an atypical distribution, which
 could be seen in the background of abnormal lung architecture, noting a
 short-term increase in interstitial opacification.  Worsening primary
 interstitial lung disease could also be considered.
