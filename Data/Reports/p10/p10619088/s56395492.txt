                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal views of the chest show no consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  Increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is likely
 due to low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and
 unchanged from prior exams.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 present.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Increased prominence of
 pulmonary vasculature is likely due to low lung volumes.
