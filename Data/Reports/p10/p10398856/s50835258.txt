                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe cough despite bronchodilators and antibiotic, evidence of
 pneumonia or other visible disease?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is a focal right infrahilar basilar opacity which
 was not seen on the previous exam, which could either be an early pneumonia or
 superimposed vessel.  The remaining of the lungs is unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small right basal opacity, which could reflect early pneumonia,
 superimposition of normal structures, and less likely a lung nodule. Short
 term follow up chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level is recommended
 to ensure resolution. 
 
 This was discussed directly over telephone with Dr. ___.
