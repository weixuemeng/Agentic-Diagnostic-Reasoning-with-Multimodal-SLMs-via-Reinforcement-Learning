                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left calcaneus pain and right-sided rib cage
 pain after playing soccer.  Assess for fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ left ribs and PA chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette is likely
 secondary to the low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 The ribs are underpenetrated, as expected on chest radiography for better
 visualization of the lungs.  The lower ribs are particularly poorly penetrated
 and not fully included on the images.  No displaced fracture of the visualized
 ribs is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is a high clinical concern for a rib fracture,
 dedicated rib radiographs should be considered.
