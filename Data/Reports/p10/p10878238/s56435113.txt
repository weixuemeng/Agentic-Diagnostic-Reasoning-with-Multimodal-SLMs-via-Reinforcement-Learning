                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ as well as chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are
 hyperexpanded and there is persistent bilateral apical lucency, representing
 emphysemetous changes.  The bilateral pulmonary hila are prominent, possibly
 representing vascular congestion, however an atypical bronchopneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. 
 Subsegmental linear atelectasis is seen within the right mid lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral hilar prominence could reflect pulmonary vascular
 congestion, however an atypical bronchopneumonia cannot be excluded.
