                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach although its
 sidehole marker lies near the gastroesophageal junction.  Lung volumes are low
 with suspected volume loss at the right lung base.  Bullous changes are
 present at the lung apices.  Allowing for crowding at the lung bases
 associated with low lung volumes, lungs otherwise show no definite parenchymal
 abnormality.  However, short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to
 reassess.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected atelectais at lung bases.  Endotracheal tube in place.  Orogastric
 tube terminating in stomach, although sidehole marked noted at level of
 gastroesophageal junction.
