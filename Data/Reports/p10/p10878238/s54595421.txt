                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study.
 Biapical lucency is unchanged, compatible with bullous emphysema. Prominent
 perihilar interstitial lung markings bilaterally are similar in comparison to
 the prior chest radiograph of ___ but not seen on earlier prior
 studies. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral perihilar interstitial prominence may represent pulmonary vascular
 congestion/interstitial edema although atypical infection is not excluded.
