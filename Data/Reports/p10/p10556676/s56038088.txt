                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with chronic aspiration and multiple intubation, hypoxia,
 rule out collapse aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar consolidation, lung collapse and small pleural effusion have
 increased since previous exam due to aspiration.  Left-sided PICC line is in
 mid SVC and the feeding tube is in proximal jejunum.  Mild pulmonary edema has
 not changed.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Increase in bibasilar atelectasis, consolidation and pleural effusion is
 due to new aspiration.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
