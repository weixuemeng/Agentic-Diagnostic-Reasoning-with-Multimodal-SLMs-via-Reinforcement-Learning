                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Variceal bleed and perforated viscus with persistent leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  Central catheter remains in place.
 
 Continued low lung volumes.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been
 removed with the central catheter remaining in place.  
 
 There is increased opacification at the right base with poor visualization of
 the right heart border.  This is consistent with volume loss in the middle
 lobe and effusion.  On the left, the pulmonary vasculature appears more
 engorged than on the right.  This could reflect unilateral edema, especially
 if the patient has been lying on that side.
