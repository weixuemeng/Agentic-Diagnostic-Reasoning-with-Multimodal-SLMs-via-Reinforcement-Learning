                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:17 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman intubated for respiratory failure, question
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Aeration at the right lung base which worsened from ___ through
 ___, has returned to baseline.  There is still reason for concern
 about cause of a persistent right basal atelectasis, specifically aspiration
 and retained secretions.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is present,
 not surprising for this longstanding atelectasis.  In the left lung
 peribronchial opacification in the lower lobes has improved, quite likely
 another finding due to aspiration.  Heart size is normal.  ET tube and left
 subclavian line are in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
