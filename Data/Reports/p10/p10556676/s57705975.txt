                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post large variceal bleed requiring ___ tube
 and question aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There has been interval improvement of opacity in the right perihilar and
 right lower lobe regions.  This is due to improving atelectasis and pleural
 effusion.  Left perihilar opacities have minimally increased, likely due to
 worsening aspiration, left lower lobe opacities are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip has been pulled
 back, the tip is still in the stomach but the side port is in the distal
 esophagus and should be advanced for more standard position.  Right IJ
 catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein.
 
 Pneumoperitoneum has decreased.  Bilateral subcutaneous emphysema has
 decreased.  TIPS stent is present in the right upper quadrant.
