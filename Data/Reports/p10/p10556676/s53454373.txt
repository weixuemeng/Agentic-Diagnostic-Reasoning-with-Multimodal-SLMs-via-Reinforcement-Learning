                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:02 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute hypoxia, question mucous plug or
 worsening aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 4:26 a.m.:
 
 Only normal part of both lungs of the right upper lobe.  Mild edema in the
 left lung, marked by severe vascular congestion, has worsened, accompanied by
 increased small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion is the same or larger and although there is some aeration in
 the right lower lobe, it is largely collapsed, which makes it difficult to say
 whether there is concurrently pneumonia present.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of
 view.  A left-sided central venous catheter ends in the upper-to-mid SVC.
