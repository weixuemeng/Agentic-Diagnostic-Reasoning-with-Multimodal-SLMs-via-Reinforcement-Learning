                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever postop.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Haziness
 projecting over the left hemidiaphragm on the frontal view with apparent
 flattening of the diaphragm is felt to more likely be due to overlying soft
 tissue and possible artifact as no evidence of consolidation or pleural
 effusion is seen on the lateral view.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Partially visualized is lower cervical spine metallic hardware.
