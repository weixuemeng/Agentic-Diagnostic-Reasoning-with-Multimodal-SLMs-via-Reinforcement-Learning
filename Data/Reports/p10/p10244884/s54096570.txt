 COMPARISON:  ___ at 724.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable left subclavian approach
 central venous catheter with tip in the lower SVC.  A right transjugular
 catheter sheath is in stable position.  The ET tube terminates 5 cm above the
 carina.  A small caliber enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm and out of
 view.  A previously seen left basilar pleural chest tube has been removed
 without obvious pneumothorax.  Dense retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation
 is unchanged, consistent with persistent left lower lobe collapse.  The right
 lung is well aerated.

 1. Status post left basal chest tube removal without significant pneumothorax.
