                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Previously
 present opacity in the right middle and both lower lobes have substantially
 improved, with residual patchy right middle lobe opacity accompanied by mild
 volume loss, as well as minimal residual opacity in the left lower lobe. 
 Bronchial wall thickening is present in the infrahilar region, best visualized
 on the lateral view.  No new areas of consolidation have developed elsewhere
 in the lungs, and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pneumonia.  Consider additional followup
 radiographs in four weeks to document complete resolution if warranted
 clinically.
