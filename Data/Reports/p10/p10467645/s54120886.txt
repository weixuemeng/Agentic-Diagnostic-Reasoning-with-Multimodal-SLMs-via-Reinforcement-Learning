                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is a
 confluent opacity in the medial right middle lobe, consistent with pneumonia,
 as well as suspected additional opacities in the lower lobes.  Upper lung
 fields appear clear.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia.  Follow-up chest radiographs
 are recommended to show resolution within eight weeks.
