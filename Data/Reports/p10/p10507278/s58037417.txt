 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is not remarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 but essentially clear.  Calcifications within the mitral annulus are noted,
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Overall the findings are most likely
 consistent with hyperinflation potentially due to COPD with no evidence of
 infectious process.
