                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ILD and VATS wedge resection.  Chest tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preop chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New right-sided chest tube ends at the apex.  There is no visible
 pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous air adjacent to the chest tube is moderate.  The
 lung volumes are low which explains increased interstitial markings in this
 patient with known interstitial lung disease.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Right chest tube projects at the apex, and there is no pneumothorax.
