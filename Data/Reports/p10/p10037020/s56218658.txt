                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, now with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 pneumonia. History of prior VATS on the right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings is seen the lungs, particularly on the right
 in the mid to upper lung. Lung volumes are appropriate. There is a more focal
 region of opacity in the right mid lung laterally.  There is no effusion.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest chronic interstitial process. More focal region of opacity in
 the right mid lung laterally could be related to prior VATS. Correlation with
 interval films should they become available would be of use.
