                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with motor vehicle collision
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Superior mediastinal widening is
 likely related to supine positioning and AP technique.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified however the extreme left costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the field of view.  No displaced fractures are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is
 likely related to supine positioning and AP technique.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is continued concern for intrathoracic injury,
 chest CT with contrast is recommended.
