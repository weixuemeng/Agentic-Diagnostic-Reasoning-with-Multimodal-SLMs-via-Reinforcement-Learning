                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, sleep apnea, COPD,
 evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  As seen on previous examination, there exists
 a moderate degree of right-sided convex scoliosis in the thoracic spine and
 the lateral view confirms the existence of a marked accentuation of the
 kyphotic curvature in the entire thoracic spine.  Diffuse demineralization is
 noted with diffuse demineralization of the vertebral bodies, but no conclusive
 evidence of any compression fracture.  Degree of osteophytic degeneration at
 the anterior right-sided borders of the individual vertebral bodies has
 increased.  There is probably mild degree of cardiac enlargement without
 typical configurational abnormality.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened
 and elongated and follows the scoliotic curvature of the spine.  There is
 presently no evidence of significant pulmonary vascular congestion and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation. 
 Nowhere in the lung fields is there any evidence of any new pneumonic
 parenchymal infiltrate and the apical area does not show evidence of any
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked scoliotic and kyphotic deformity of the thoracic spine
 with mild degree of progression over the last ___ years.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement without evidence of pulmonary congestion and no evidence of acute
 infiltrates or pleural effusion.
