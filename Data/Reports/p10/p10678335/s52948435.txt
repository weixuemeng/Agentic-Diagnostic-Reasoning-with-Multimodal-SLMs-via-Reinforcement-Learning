                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent respiratory failure, bronchopleural
 fistula, recurrent chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Rounded opacity within the
 right lower lobe measuring 2.2 x 3.0 cm is compatible with a saccular
 bronchial aneurysm, better assessed on the previous CT, and slightly decreased
 in size compared to the previous radiograph when it measured 2.9 x 3.4 cm. 
 Previously noted small right pleural effusion has almost completely resolved. 
 Aeration of the right lung base is also improved with minimal streaky opacity
 likely reflective of improving pneumonia.  No new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased size of right lower lobe rounded opacity correlating to the saccular
 bronchial aneurysm as seen on the previous CT.  Improved aeration of the right
 lung base compatible with improving pneumonia and near complete resolution of
 the previously noted small right pleural effusion.
