                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with dementia and abrasions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Focal opacity within the right mid lung field
 is unchanged from the prior exam, with minimal retrocardiac atelectasis also
 demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Old left-sided
 rib fractures are noted.  Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the
 right shoulder.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is
 demonstrated with loss of height of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar
 junction, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent focal opacity within the right mid lung field concerning for an
 infectious process, though if there is no sign of infection, a neoplasm is not
 excluded.  Correlation with Chest CT is recommended.
 
 No acute traumatic abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
