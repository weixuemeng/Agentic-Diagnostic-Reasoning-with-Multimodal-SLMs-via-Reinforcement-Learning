                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with Pseudomonas pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip seats 5.5 cm above the carina.  An
 endogastric tube tip courses inferiorly and out of field of view.  An
 additional tubular density projects over midline and stops just before the GE
 junction.  A right-sided PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  A left-sided
 central venous catheter tip terminates at the lower SVC.  The heart size and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs overall demonstrate
 a distorted and scarred architecture.  On top of that are multifocal
 opacities, apparently affecting the right lung worse than the left, especially
 in the upper lobe.  Additionally, pleural fluid is seen along the right lung
 apex.  The left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Continued multifocal airspace opacities, slightly improved in appearance.
 2. Feeding tube tip in distal esophagus - recommend advancement.
