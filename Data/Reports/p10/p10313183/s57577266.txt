                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable semi-erect AP view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube
 ends 5.5 cm from the carina.  Right internal jugular line ends in the low SVC.
 Left internal jugular line ends in the mid to low SVC.  The feeding tube ends
 out of view.  Another line is seen ending in the distal esophagus. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The bilateral lung
 parenchyma demonstrate distortion and scarring superimposed on emphysema. Ther
 is pleural thickening in the apices.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There is
 likely some mild pulmonary edema.  Right upper lobe, right middle lower lobe,
 and left upper lobe parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared to most recent study in bilateral
 parenchymal opacities.  Likely element of overlying mild pulmonary edema.
