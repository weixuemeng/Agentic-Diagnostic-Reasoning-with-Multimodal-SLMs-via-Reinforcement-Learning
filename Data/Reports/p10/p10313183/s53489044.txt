                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with chronic right upper lobe changes,
 status post radiation for lung cancer, admitted with sepsis attributed to
 pneumonia, now clinically improved with persistent leukocytosis, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:47.
 
 AP portable upright chest film ___ at 12:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated and markedly distorted with retraction related to the
 patient's underlying emphysema.  There continues to be a triangular opacity at
 the left upper lung as well as more chronic changes in the right upper lung,
 which are essentially unchanged since ___.  These findings likely
 represent a left upper lobe pneumonia and right radiation changes with
 scarring.  No new airspace consolidation is appreciated.  Heart remains normal
 in size.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the airspace
 process, but do not appear to be changed when compared to the prior study of
 ___.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
