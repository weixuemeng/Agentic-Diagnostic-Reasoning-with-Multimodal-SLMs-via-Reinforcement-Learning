 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // ? infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest

 enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Mildly
 distended colonic loops of bowel are seen within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
