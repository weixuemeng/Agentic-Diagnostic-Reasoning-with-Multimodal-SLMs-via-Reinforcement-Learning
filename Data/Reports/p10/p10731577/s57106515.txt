                                 FINAL REPORT
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Allowing for this factor, heart is upper limits of normal in
 size.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Left scapula is not well assessed on this
 conventional chest radiograph but appears unremarkable on this limited
 assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No chest radiographic findings to account for left scapular pain.  Please see
 separately dictated left scapular radiographs under clip #___.
