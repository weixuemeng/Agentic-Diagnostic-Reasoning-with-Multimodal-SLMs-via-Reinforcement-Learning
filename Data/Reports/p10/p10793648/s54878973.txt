                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with malpositioned PIC catheter.  Assess following
 repositioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 AP portable view of the chest demonstrates repositioned right PIC catheter
 projecting at mid SVC.  It appears appropriately positioned without previously
 seen terminal coil in this projection.  Left costophrenic angle is not fully
 included in the study.  Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists with adjacent area of
 opacity, likely compressive atelectasis persists.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 unchanged.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Repositioned right PIC catheter tip projects over mid SVC and appears
 appropriately positined in this projection.  ___ consider lateral radiograph
 to ensure correct positioning.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Persistent mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
