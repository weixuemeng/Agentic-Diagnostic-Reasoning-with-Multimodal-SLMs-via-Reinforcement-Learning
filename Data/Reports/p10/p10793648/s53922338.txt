                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right Pleurx catheter to waterseal, here
 to reevaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided PICC line is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating in the upper-to-mid SVC.  Widening of the
 mediastinum is unchanged and correlates with extensive mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy seen on CT torso of ___.  The cardiac silhouette is
 post-operatively enlarged but stable from the preceding radiograph.  A right
 basilar Pleurx catheter is unchanged in position with a stable small right
 pleural effusion.  A left-sided pleural effusion is increased in size from
 ___ with new convexity towards the lung which raises the possibility of a
 loculated pleural effusion.  Increased interstitial markings and vascular
 congestion are unchanged from the preceding radiograph and consistent with
 mild-to-moderate heart failure.  Retrocardiac opacification is unchanged
 consistent with atelectasis at the left lung base, although superimposed
 pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased left pleural effusion from ___ with convexity towards the
 lung raising the possibility of a loculated left pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and vascular congestion.
