                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female pleural effusions and shortness of breath. 
 Assess for worsening effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The moderate right loculated pleural effusion has increased,
 particularly in the apical and lateral portions with resultant increasing
 consolidation in the right lung.  While much of this is likely compressive
 atelectasis, concomitant pulmonary edema or infectious process would be
 difficult to exclude.  Given the short time course, malignant progression is
 less likely.  Left dependent pleural effusion is also likely increased with
 accompanying mild interstitial edema given the presence of thickened septal
 lines.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Left Port-A-Cath is in unchanged
 position with interval removal of right PICC. Bibasilar chest tubes are in
 similar position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased moderate loculated right and small dependent left
 pleural effusions with accompanying mild pulmonary edema.  Infectious process
 in the right lobe would be difficult to exclude.
