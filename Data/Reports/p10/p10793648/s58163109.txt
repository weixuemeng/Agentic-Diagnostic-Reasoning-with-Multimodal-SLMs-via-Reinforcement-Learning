                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of pericardial and pleural effusions, status
 post right pleural catheter removal.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates right PIC catheter tip coiled
 at the level of mid SVC.  It maybe positioned within the azygos vein.  Left
 pleural catheter has been removed.  Trace left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists with adjacent
 areas of opacities, likely atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart is mildly enlarged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PIC catheter tip is coiled at the level of mid SVC.  Repositioning
 by 1.5 cm is recommended.
 
 2.  Pleural catheter has been removed with residual trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Persistent mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 5pm ___ by phone.
