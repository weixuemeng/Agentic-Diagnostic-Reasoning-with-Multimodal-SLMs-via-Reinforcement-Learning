 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of breast cancer, admitted with cardiac tamponade, now
 pericardial window.  Questionable pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:35 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided chest tube and a pericardial drain.  Previously drain was removed.
 
 The right-sided effusion is completely resolved, the presence of a minimal
 right apical pneumothorax in millimetric ___ cannot be excluded.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally decreased.  The pre-existing
 left pleural effusion appears minimally increased as compared to the previous
 image.  No evidence of pneumonia, minimal fluid overload might be present.
