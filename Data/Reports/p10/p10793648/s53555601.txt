                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pleural effusions and pulmonary edema after
 diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Widened mediastinum and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. 
 There has been interval mild worsening of mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
 Right upper lobe increasing opacities could be due to increasing pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis, but asymmetric edema or infection cannot be
 excluded.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing
 the difference in positioning of the patient.  Right PICC tip is in the mid
 SVC.  Right basal chest tube is in unchanged position.
