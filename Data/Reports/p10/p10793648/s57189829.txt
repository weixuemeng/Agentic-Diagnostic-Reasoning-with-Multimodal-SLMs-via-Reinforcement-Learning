                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions with right Pleurx catheter.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular
 congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar
 atelectasis.  Right Pleurx catheter is again seen without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe, though superimposed pneumonia would have
 to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
