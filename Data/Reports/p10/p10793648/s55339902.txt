                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer and chronic pleural effusions,
 evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 distribution and severity of the opacities in the left lung.  The right lung
 continues to be partially collapsed and shows perihilar opacities that are
 minimally increasing in severity.  However, the pre-existing fluid in the
 pleural space has decreased.  The extent of the free air in the pleura could
 have minimally increased.  The position of the right and left chest tubes and
 of the left pectoral Port-A-Cath is constant.
