                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of malignant bilateral pleural effusions.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___.  CT-Torso on
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right PICC and bilateral pleural drains are in unchanged
 position.  The right pleural effusion is loculated along the lateral chest
 wall, similar to prior CT.  The left pleural effusion is little changed. 
 There are persistent parenchymal opacities of the right mid and lower lungs,
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in bilateral pleural effusions.
