                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema and dyspnea, pericardial and right pleural drain.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing opacity at
 the right lung base, likely to reflect aspiration or atelectasis.  Otherwise,
 the appearance of the lung parenchyma, including moderate fluid overload, is
 unchanged.  Finally, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the moderate left
 pleural effusion is also unchanged.  No other changes.
