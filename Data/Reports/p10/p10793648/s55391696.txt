                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Several prior studies obtained a day prior.
 
 As compared to the immediate post-thoracocentesis chest radiograph, there is
 interval slight increase in the apical pneumothorax as well as accumulation of
 the laterally loculated pleural effusion.  Opacification of the right lung
 base is unchanged.  The left extensive parenchymal opacities are grossly
 unchanged as well, and might correspond to pulmonary edema versus infectious
 process.  Left chest tube is in place.  Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
