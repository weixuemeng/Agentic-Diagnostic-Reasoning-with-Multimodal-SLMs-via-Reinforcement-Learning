 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:11 PM
  Interval reduction in size of loculated right pleural effusion with a  new
  right apical pneumothorax as well as foci of loculated right hydropnumothorax.
  Otherwise, little change compared to prior CT from the same day with bilateral
  interstitial opacities likely representative of edema; however, an atypical
  infection cannot be excluded. Continued follow up is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Severe cough during right thoracocentesis, suspected
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The portable AP radiograph demonstrates substantial decrease in the right
 loculated pleural effusion with interval development of loculated
 hydropneumothorax in particular involving upper lungs.  The right mid lung
 zone demonstrates extensive opacities, most likely representing potentially
 trapped lung as well as re-expansion edema.  Right chest tube with is located
 in the lower pleural space.
 
 Bilateral, widespread opacities involving the entire lungs are again
 demonstrated, slightly more pronounced at the left upper and mid lung zones. 
 Additional loculations along the right mediastinal border are still present,
 the basal one unchanged but the upper one contains loculated
 hydropneumothorax.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of low SVC.
