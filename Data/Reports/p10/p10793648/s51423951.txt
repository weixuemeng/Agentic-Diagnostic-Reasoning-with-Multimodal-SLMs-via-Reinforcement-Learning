                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis with
 removal of 1.4 liters.  Assess for residual effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates near-complete resolution of
 the left pleural effusion.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists
 with associated thickening of the right minor fissure, likely due to pleural
 fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.  Mild pulmonary edema persists.  Right
 PIC catheter tip projects over mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Near complete resolution of the left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with associated
 pulmonary edema, unchanged.
