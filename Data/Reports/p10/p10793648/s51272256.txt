                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions with history of breast cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pleural
 effusions are less pronounced.  Drainage tubes remain at the bases and there
 is residual blunting of the costophrenic angles and atelectasis.
 
 The pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially improved, though there is
 still some evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in the right mid and
 lower zones.
 
 Right subclavian catheter tip remains in good position.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
