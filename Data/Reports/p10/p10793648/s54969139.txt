 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 835
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of breast cancer, pericardial
 and pleural effusion status post pericardiocentesis with persistent hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There continue to be bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left,
 with associated patchy bibasilar airspace disease which may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal widening particularly in the right
 paratracheal vicinity likely reflects lymphadenopathy which is evident on an
 outside CT.  Overall, cardiac size is stable.  There is a catheter overlying
 the heart which may be pericardial in position.  No pneumothorax is seen.
