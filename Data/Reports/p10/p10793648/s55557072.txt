 Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size since
 study obtained five hours prior.  Small right pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Cardiac size is
 difficult to discern due to adjacent opacities.

 2.  Left lung base consolidation, likely atelectasis with associated
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, slightly increased in size since
 study obtained six hours prior.
