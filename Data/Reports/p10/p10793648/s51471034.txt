 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pericardial effusion, status post pericardial window. 
 Follow up left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Asymmetric right greater than left mild pulmonary edema has improved. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions have decreased.  Bibasilar lung
 aeration has improved.  Left pneumothorax is no longer visualized.  Right PICC
 tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pleural
 catheters are in unchanged positions.  Right upper lobe perihilar opacities
 have markedly improved.
