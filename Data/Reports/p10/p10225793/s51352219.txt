  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  A rounded 8 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung.  This could
  be due to overlapping shadows although underlying pulmonary nodule is
  possible.  Nonurgent repeat frontal view with shallow obliques for further
  assessment and if it persists, CT will be necessary.
