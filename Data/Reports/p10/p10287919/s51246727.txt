 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with known effusions and pneumothorax.  Evaluate
 for and worsening pneumothorax or tension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant interval change.  There may be a tiny apical pneumothorax on

 obscures portions of the lung apices.  Bilateral small, greater on the right,
 pleural effusions are unchanged in the positions of both chest tubes
 bilaterally are unchanged.  Dual lead cardiac pacer defibrillator device is
 unchanged.  Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are also unchanged.

 No significant interval change, possible tiny apical pneumothorax on the right
 is hard to assess due to overlying soft tissue from the chin.
