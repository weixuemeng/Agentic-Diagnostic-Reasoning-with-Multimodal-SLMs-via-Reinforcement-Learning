                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  The right hilum is
 asymmetrically enlarged compared to the left hilum but has a similar size and
 configuration compared to a baseline radiograph ___ ___.  A chest CT
 performed in ___ demonstrated no evidence of a right hilar mass, and
 the observed asymmetry is probably due to a combination of a slight rotation
 related to mild scoliosis and a prominent pulmonary vascularity.
 
 Lungs are slightly hyperexpanded but grossly clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
