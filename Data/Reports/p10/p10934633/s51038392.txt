                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV with worsening confusion and hypoxia, evaluate for
 pneumocystis pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest performed.  There is a right
 retrocardiac opacity, best appreciated on the lateral view, which is
 consistent with atelectasis, although infection is not entirely excluded. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The descending aorta is
 ectatic.  There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung opacity, most likely atelectasis, however,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
