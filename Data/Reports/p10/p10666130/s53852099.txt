                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension presenting with syncope and right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 low in volume with diffuse reticular opacities, confluent more peripherally
 and more pronounced basally, which is consistent with pulmonary fibrotic
 disease.  In the absence of prior examinations, it is difficult to assess if a
 given area has focally increased to reflect an acute change secondary to
 either infection or fluid accumulation. However, prominence of the pulmonary
 and mediastinal vasculature in this context suggests mild edema. Heart size is
 top normal with normal aortic contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Severe interstitial abnormality could reflect pulmonary fibrosis
 though in the absence of prior examinations it is difficult to determine the
 presence of an acute change; however there may be mild pulmonary edema.
