                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, s/p 1 week  // r/o pulmonary edema
 and pneumonia      r/o pulmonary edema and pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and CT imaging of the lower chest since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe pulmonary fibrosis is chronic, but progressed since ___.  Compared to
 ___, the lungs are no worse.  A mass or small region of pneumonia would
 be obscured by the fibrosis.  There is no pleural effusion, and if there were
 cardiac decompensation I would expect either more pulmonary edema or
 appreciable widening of the mediastinum and pleural effusions, none of which
 is clearly present.
