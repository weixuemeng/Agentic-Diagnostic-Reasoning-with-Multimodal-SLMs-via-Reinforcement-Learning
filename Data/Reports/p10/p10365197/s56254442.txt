 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for Dobbhoff course.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The intragastric distal part of the Dobbhoff catheter is kinked. 
 Given the limitations of one projection only, this could be the cause for the
 clinical dysfunction of the catheter.
 
 No other change.  Unchanged left PICC line.  Unchanged vertebral stabilization
 devices.  Unchanged evidence of mild interstitial lung edema.
