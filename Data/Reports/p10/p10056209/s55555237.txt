  1.  No pneumonia.
  2.  Abnormal contour along the left heart with a corresponding increase in
  density on the lateral view.  The differential includes but is not limited to
  absence of the pericardium, ventricular aneurysm or pericardial cyst.  If no
  prior imaging is available, a CT would be recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and elevated lactate.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Obscuration of the left costophrenic
 sulcus is likely from the pericardial fat.  There is an abnormal contour to
 the left heart with corresponding increase in density seen on the lateral
 view.   There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.  The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.  Sternotomy
 wires, mediastinal clips and carotid calcifications are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  No pneumonia.
 2.  Abnormal contour along the left heart with a corresponding increase in
 density on the lateral view.  The differential includes but is not limited to
 absence of the pericardium, ventricular aneurysm or pericardial cyst.  If no
 prior imaging is available, a CT would be recommended.
