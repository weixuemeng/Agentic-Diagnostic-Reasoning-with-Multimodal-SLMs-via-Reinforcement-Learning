                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia and chest pain.  Abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lung volumes are
 seen.  There is retrocardiac opacity, which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm,
 which could be due to atelectasis given low lung volumes, however, component
 of effusion or consolidation is also possible.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for technique and
 low inspiratory effort.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
 No free air below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Left basilar opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, potentially due to atelectasis; however, repeat exam with PA
 and lateral can be performed if the patient is amenable.
