                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Prominent crackles in right middle lung.  Patient with
 history of interstitial lung disease and scleroderma.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study CT ___, chest x-ray ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There are persistent low lung volumes.  Bi
 basilar interstitial lung abnormalities greater in the left lower lobe is
 better seen in prior CT consistent with known NSIP.  These findings are
 grossly unchanged from prior studies.  Minimal interstitial peripheral
 abnormality is also present in the left upper lobe.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of lobar pneumonia.
