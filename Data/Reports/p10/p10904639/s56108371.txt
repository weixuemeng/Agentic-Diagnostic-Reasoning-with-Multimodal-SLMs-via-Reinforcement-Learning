                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for resolution of pneumonia and effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and an older study from
 ___.  CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided pleural effusion is still present but much smaller
 on today's study.  There is unchanged right lower lobe opacity, consistent
 with persistent pneumonia.  Aside from the interstitial markings consistent
 with the chronic fibrotic disease, the lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe consolidation consistent with ongoing
 pneumonia.  
 2.  Right pleural effusion is smaller.
 3.  Chronic interstitial fibrosis.
