                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with systemic sclerosis and pulmonary
 hypertension, concern for aspiration.  Assess for new infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were obtained.  Scattered upper lung and
 more confluent left perihilar and bibasilar opacities are seen in a similar
 distribution to the previous examination and even more remote chest CTs,
 compatible with the patient's known interstitial lung disease with interval
 increase in right-sided small pleural effusion with fluid tracking along the
 fissure and trace left effusion.  On this background, a developing infectious
 process or sequelae of aspiration would be difficult to exclude in the right
 base.  Enlarged pulmonary artery is compatible with history of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension with otherwise normal heart size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Changes of chronic interstitial lung disease, likely related to
 the patient's known systemic sclerosis, with increased right effusion. 
 Infectious process or aspiration in the right base would be difficult to
 exclude on these images.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:55 on ___ by phone by
 Dr. ___.
