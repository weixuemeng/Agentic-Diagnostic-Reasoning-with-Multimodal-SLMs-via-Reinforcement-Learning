                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with stroke and elevated white blood
 count, concern for infection, evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Cardiac enlargement as
 before, but no increased pulmonary vascular congestion in comparison with the
 preceding study.  The left basal parenchymal density has increased and
 obliterates the diaphragmatic contour completely.  Possibility of coexisting
 localized pleural effusion in this area cannot be excluded.  Comparison of the
 pulmonary vasculature demonstrates possibly further mild regression of the
 congestive pattern.  On the previous examination, there existed some hazy
 diffuse density in the left base already, but this appears to have progressed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of pulmonary congestion, increased local left basal
 density suggestive of an inflammatory infiltrate.
 
 Referring physician, ___, was paged at 4:05 p.m.
