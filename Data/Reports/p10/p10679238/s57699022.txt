                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Difficulty swallowing.  Check NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 14:25 p.m.
 
 Since the prior film, a Dobbhoff-type tube is placed.  The radiopaque portion
 of the tube overlies the lower mediastinum, and has not progress beyond the GE
 junction (assuming no hiatal hernia).  The patient is rotated.  Again seen is
 cardiomegaly, probable background COPD, left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, and a small left effusion.  Probable mild
 right-greater-than-left apical pleural parenchymal scarring.  Minimal
 atelectasis right base.  Mild upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. 
 Density over lower thoracic spine is consistent with a vertebroplasty or
 kyphoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube tip overlies the lower mediastinum and does not
 appear to have passed through the GE junction into the stomach, assuming
 normal esophagogastric anatomy.  
 
 This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, in the late
 afternoon on the day of the exam (___, phone).  Please see subsequent film
 from 17:31 p.m. showing advancement of the Dobbhoff tube.
