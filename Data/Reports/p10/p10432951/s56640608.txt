                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC line in proximal SVC has been cleaned and PICC pulled out
 slightly, please evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval withdrawal of right-sided PICC line with tip terminating
 in the upper superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax identified. Nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing into stomach and out of view.
 There is a persistent right hemidiaphragm elevation with increased right lower
 lung consolidation, likely due to right middle lobe collapse.  Unchanged left
 retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of atelectasis and
 effusion, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.  Pulmonary
 edema is unchanged. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval withdrawal of right PICC line with tip in the upper
 superior vena cava.  Increased right middle lung collapse.  Stable bilateral
 pleural effusions and retrocardiac opacification.
