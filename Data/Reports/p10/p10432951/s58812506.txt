                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:12 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check new ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view.  Lung volumes have improved, and mild pulmonary
 edema is more uniformly distributed.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 presumed.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly has improved possibly because of
 positive pressure ventilator support.  No pneumothorax.
