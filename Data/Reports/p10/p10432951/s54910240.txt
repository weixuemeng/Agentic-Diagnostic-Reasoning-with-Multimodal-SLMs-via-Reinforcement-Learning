                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple medical problems, now with
 somnolence and worsening hypoxia after p.o. challenge yesterday, here to
 evaluate for evidence of aspiration or worsening pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Opacifications at the bilateral bases,
 right greater than the left, likely represent small bilateral pleural
 effusions with associated atelectasis, now with worsening right middle lobe
 atelectasis compared to ___.  The right upper lobe opacity seen on the
 preceding radiograph is no longer present which likely represents resolved
 right upper lobe atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  A right-sided PICC line is unchanged in position
 with the tip terminating in the upper SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is moderately enlarged but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased bibasilar opacification on the right greater than the left,
 consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis,
 worse in the right middle lobe.  Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Improved aeration at the right upper lobe consistent with resolved
 atelectasis.
 3.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
