                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Restrictive lung disease and worsening hypoxia.  Please evaluate
 pulmonary edema or hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates persistent though
 minimally improved mild to moderate pulmonary edema with slightly improved
 aeration of the bilateral upper lungs, left greater than right.  Bibasilar
 opacifications noted, likely combination of atelectasis and bilateral pleural
 effusions, though concurrent infectious process cannot be appreciated. 
 Endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing into stomach and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimally improved pulmonary edema with stable large bilateral
 pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacifications likely combination of atelectasis
 and effusion, though concurrent infectious process is a possibility in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
