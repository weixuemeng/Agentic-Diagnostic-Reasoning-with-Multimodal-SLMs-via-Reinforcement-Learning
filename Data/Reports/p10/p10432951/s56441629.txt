                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mucus plug status post intubation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 The tip of the ET tube is not well delineated.  It appears to overlap the NG
 tube and may lie approximately 8.3 cm above the carina at the level of the
 upper clavicle.  An NG tube is present -- the tip overlies the fundus.
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone re-distribution and
 diffuse vascular blurring.  There is increased opacity at the right base which
 could represent subsegmental or segmental atelectasis, with an elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  I suspect the presence of a small right effusion as well. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  No gross left effusion.  Prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery is suggested.  The hila also appear prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube approximately 8.3 cm above the carina.  Please see comment.  
 
 2. Cardiomegaly with suspected pulmonary artery enlargement.
 
 3. Findings consistent with CHF. Compared with ___ at 2:40 a.m., the CHF
 findings are improved. 
 
 4. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 3.  Suspected atelectasis at the right base with elevated right hemidiaphragm.
 This is improved c/w with ___ at 2:40 am, but interval improvement could be
 also relate to differences in positioning, as the current film was obtained
 semi-erect.
