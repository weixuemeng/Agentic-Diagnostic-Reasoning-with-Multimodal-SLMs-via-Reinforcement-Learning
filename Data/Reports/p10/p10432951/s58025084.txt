 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 There is marked cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and interstial
 and some pulmonary edema.  There is more confluent opacity at R>L basess,
 consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion, though
 small effusions could be present.  The mediastinal contours and hila appear
 prominent on this exam.
