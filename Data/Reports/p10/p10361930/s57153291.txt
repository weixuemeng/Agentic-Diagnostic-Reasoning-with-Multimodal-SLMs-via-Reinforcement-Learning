                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is reportedly status post recent placement of
 tracheobronchial stent, which is not well visualized on this portable exam. 
 Endotracheal tube remains in place, currently terminating 4 cm above the
 carina with the neck in a flexed position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities have progressed in the
 interval and may be due to a progressive multifocal infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
