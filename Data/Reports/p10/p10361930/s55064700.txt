 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the recent radiograph, there has been little overall
 change except for slight further improvement in asymmetrically distributed
 bilateral airspace process, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema
 with or without co-existing infectious pneumonia.
