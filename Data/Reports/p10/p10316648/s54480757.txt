                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrates low lung volumes and mildly
 engorged pulmonary vasculature compared to ___, potentially
 accounted for by the lower lung volumes.  There is increased opacity at the
 posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral view.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity seen in the posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral view,
 potentially secondary to atelectasis given very low lung volumes on this view.
 If persistent concern for infection, repeat with improved insiratory effort
 can be attempted.
 
 Patient had been admitted at time of final report with pneumonia among reasons
 for admission.
