 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx + ppd  // ? ACTIVE TBC

 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Heart size is normal and there is no
 pleural abnormality.
 
 There is marked asymmetry in the size of the pulmonary arteries, right is
 mildly enlarged and the left is very small, raising possibility of congenital
 pulmonary artery atresia, probably not necessary to investigate in a patient
 of this age.
 
 Thoracic aorta is tortuous and mildly enlarged but not focally aneurysmal. 
 Peripheral pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
