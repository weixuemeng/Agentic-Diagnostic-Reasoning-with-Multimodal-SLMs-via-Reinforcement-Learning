 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Liver disease, pneumonia, pleural effusions, acute respiratory
 distress, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 00:22 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  The bilateral,
 predominantly central parenchymal opacities, that are extensive and very
 severe, are unchanged.  No larger pleural effusions are seen.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal mediastinal contours.
