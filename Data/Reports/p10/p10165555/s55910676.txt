                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST on ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right effusion is decreased compared to the CT scan from the
 prior day.  There continues to be some volume loss in the right lower lung and
 underlying infectious infiltrate in this region cannot be excluded.  There is
 a diffuse alveolar infiltrate in the left lung, medial greater than lateral,
 likely infectious in etiology.  This infiltrate appears more extensive than on
 the CT from the prior day and is new compared to the study from a month prior.
