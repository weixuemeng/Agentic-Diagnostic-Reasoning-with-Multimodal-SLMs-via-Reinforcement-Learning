                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cholangiocarcinoma and desaturation,
 evaluate for infection or aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior studies including portable AP radiograph from ___ and CT torso with contrast from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. 
 There are bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities that are extensive and worse
 on the right side.  Given the distribution and underlying clinical history,
 this most likely etiology is infectious; however, pulmonary hemorrhage should
 be considered if there is accompanying coagulopathy.  Pulmonary edema is less
 likely given the distribution and time course.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mostly stable appearance of bilateral diffuse parenchymal
 opacities which are most likely infectious in etiology. Other considerations
 may be pulmonary hemorrhage and least likely pulmonary edema.
