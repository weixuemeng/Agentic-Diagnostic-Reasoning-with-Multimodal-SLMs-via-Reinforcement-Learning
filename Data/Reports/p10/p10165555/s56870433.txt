                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, patient with cholangiocarcinoma.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 ET tube is persistently too low, the tip is 1 cm above the carina; this should
 be retracted.
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities are unchanged.  Overall increased density of the
 right lung due to moderate layering pleural effusion.  The underlying lung
 opacities as mentioned before could be due to infection or hemorrhage. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
