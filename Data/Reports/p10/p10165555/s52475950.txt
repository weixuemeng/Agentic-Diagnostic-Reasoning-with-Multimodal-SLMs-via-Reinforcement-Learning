                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cholangiocarcinoma, respiratory failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The endotracheal tube is still low, projecting within 1 cm of the
 carina.  As emphasized in the previous report, the tube should be pulled back
 by approximately 2-3 cm.  Course of the nasogastric tube and of the right PICC
 line is constant.  Moderate-to-severe pleural effusion on the right, with
 underlying very extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities.  The cardiac
 silhouette can barely be visualized.
