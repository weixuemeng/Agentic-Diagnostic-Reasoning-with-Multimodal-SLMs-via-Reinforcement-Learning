                                 FINAL REPORT
 History: hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5 a.m.
 
 Single semi-upright chest film performed at 3:30 p.m. is compared to the film
 performed at 5 a.m. the same day.  Compared to the prior study, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube remains in adequate position approximately 3.1 cm above the
 carina.  Tip of the right PICC line is at the cavoatrial junction.  The NG
 tube is in the stomach.  Compared to the prior study, there is now increased
 overall opacity of the left hemithorax, less extensive than on the right. 
 Findings are consistent with bilateral pleural effusions, new on the left. 
 The underlying pulmonary opacities are essentially unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared to the prior study, there is increased overall opacity
 of the left hemithorax most consistent with new moderate-sized layering
 pleural effusion.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.  Appearance of
 the right lung is unchanged.
