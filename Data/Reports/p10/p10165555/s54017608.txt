                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multifocal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications persist and may even be worsening.  Again, this could
 reflect diffuse pulmonary infection or pulmonary hemorrhage.  The time course
 and distribution makes pulmonary edema somewhat less likely.
