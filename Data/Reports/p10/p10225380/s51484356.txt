                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with questionable pneumonia versus
 volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position
 and dual endovascular electrode system in unchanged position.  Moderate
 cardiac enlargement as before.  The pulmonary vasculature shows now a slightly
 more marked perivascular haze than before, which could be caused by the
 patient's overhydration.  The existence of a discrete well-defined parenchymal
 infiltrate in the lower lobe area on the right side; however, represents a
 pneumonic process.  These findings have progressed since the preceding
 examination of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further progression of unquestionable parenchymal infiltrate in
 right lower lobe posterior area.  Telephone call was placed to number ___
 for Dr. ___ at 2:40 p.m.
