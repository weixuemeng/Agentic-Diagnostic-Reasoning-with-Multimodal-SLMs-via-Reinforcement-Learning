 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The left pectoral pacemaker, the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric
 tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position. 
 Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  Moderate pulmonary
 fluid overload is likely.
