                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubation, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube resides approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
 courses into the left upper abdomen, tip excluded from view.  There is
 consolidation at the left lung base which likely represents a combination of
 effusion and possibly aspiration/atelectasis.  The right lung appears grossly
 clear.  Heart size cannot be readily assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears
 normal.  A right humeral head replacement is noted.  Degenerative changes are
 severe at the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately.  Opacity at the left
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis, aspiration, and effusion.
