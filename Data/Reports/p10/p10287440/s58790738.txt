                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for 1 week.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  A moderate to large hiatal hernia is re-
 demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Subtle branching opacities in the mid lung
 fields bilaterally may correlate to the clusters of peribronchial tiny
 opacities seen on recent CT.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Subtle branching opacities within the mid lung fields may correlate with
 the areas suspicious for chronic atypical mycobacterial infection or
 aspiration, as described on the prior Chest CT. No new focal consolidation is
 otherwise noted.
 
 2. Moderate to large hiatal hernia.
