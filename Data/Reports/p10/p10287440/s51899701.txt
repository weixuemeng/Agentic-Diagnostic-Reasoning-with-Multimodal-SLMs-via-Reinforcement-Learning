 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New lesions, high-grade lymphoma, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lungs show slightly
 better ventilation.  The extent of the known hiatal hernia is unchanged. 
 Unchanged normal appearance of the mediastinum.  No evidence of mediastinal
 and hilar masses.  Pre-described parenchymal opacities, better documented on a
 previous CT examination from ___, are less obvious than at the
 previous exam.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sinuses bilaterally on the lateral view, potentially caused by
 minimal pleural effusions, seen on the lateral image only.  Unchanged size and
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
