                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with possible HCAP and NGT  // interval change   
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, it is difficult to follow the NG
 tube distal to the lower esophagus.  A repeat study with the top of the image
 at the clavicular level and using abdominal technique could be helpful for
 better showing the course of the NG tube.
 There is somewhat ill defined opacification at the right base medially.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect a developing pneumonia.
