 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:46 AM
  Low lung volumes.  Left basilar atelectasis.  Streaky opacities in the right
  apex also likely represent atelectasis.  Well-delineated radiodensity
  overlying the right hilum represents a large pulmonary artery seen on prior
  CT.  Trace pneumoperitoneum consistent with recent laparoscopic surgery.  D/w
  Dr. ___ at 4:40 a.m..

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Postoperative day 1 after laparoscopy, desaturation.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No direct comparison available at the time of dictation.  An old
 radiograph from ___ is used for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is both left and right basal
 atelectasis.  Moreover, an area of band-like opacities has newly appeared in
 the right upper lobe.  Given lower lung volumes, the hilar structures appear
 slightly larger than on the previous image.  Minimal pneumoperitoneum of the
 laparoscopy, as manifested by some amount of infradiaphragmatic air.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
