                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with concern for aortic dissection.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 are prominent.  The lungs are clear of consolidation, although there is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature as well.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mediastinal prominence may represent an unfolded aorta, although
 correlation with subsequent torso CTA performed on the same date is
 recommended; minimal pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
