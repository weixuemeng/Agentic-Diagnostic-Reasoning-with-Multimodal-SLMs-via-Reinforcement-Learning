                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT performed in ___ as well as chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  There are several few nodules suggesting
 metastatic malignancy which are difficult to compare to the prior studies for
 small changes.  An asymmetric opacity involving the left lung apex and
 suprahilar region suggests pneumonia superimposed on other findings.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia. Pulmonary nodules suggesting
 metastases, which are difficult to compare directly to prior studies.
