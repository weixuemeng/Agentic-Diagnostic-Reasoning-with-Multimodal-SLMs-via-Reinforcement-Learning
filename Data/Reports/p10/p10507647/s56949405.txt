                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath and right sided abdominal pain. 
 Patient has a history of metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter extending into the cavoatrial junction.
 Pulmonary nodules are again noted the largest of which projects over the right
 lower lung measuring approximately 2.3 cm in diameter.  These are better
 assessed on the prior CT of the chest. Additional nodules are also present. No
 signs of pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is stable.
 Prominence of the mediastinum reflects known right paramediastinal mass. Areas
 of scarring in the left lung apex and the right lung apex are unchanged. Bony
 structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Metastatic disease with pulmonary nodules and large right paramediastinal mass
 better assessed on prior CT. No superimposed pneumonia.
