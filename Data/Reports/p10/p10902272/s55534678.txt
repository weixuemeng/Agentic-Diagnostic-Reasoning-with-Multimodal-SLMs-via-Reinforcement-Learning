                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single frontal view.
 
 HISTORY:  CoreValve placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices.  A right-sided pacer is again
 seen to terminate in the region of the right ventricle.  CoreValve is not as
 well seen as compared to the prior study due to technique, however, is in
 grossly stable position.  The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No focal consolidation.  Persistent minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
