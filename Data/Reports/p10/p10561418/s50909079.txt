 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:37 AM
  Low lung volumes, limiting assessment of the lung parenchyma.  However, within
  these limits, no evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis, right worse
  than left, though cannot exclude underlying infection. If clinically
  indicated, repeat chest radiograph with full inspiration would be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left chest wall pain and hypoxia after a fall 
 // eval PTX, rib fractures or other acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, accentuating the lung markings and the mediastinal
 silhouette.  Moderate cardiomegaly is likely stable.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis, though underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes, limiting assessment of the lung parenchyma.  However,
 within these limits, no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis,
 right worse than left, though cannot exclude underlying infection.  If
 clinically indicated, repeat chest radiograph with full inspiration would be
 helpful.
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
