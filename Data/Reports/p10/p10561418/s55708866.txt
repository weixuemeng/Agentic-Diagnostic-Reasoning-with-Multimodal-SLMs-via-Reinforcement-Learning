                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  Fullness of the right paratracheal
 stripe may be due to underlying tortuous vessels.  Fullness of the right hilum
 is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 is present.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly without evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Fullness of the right hilum, possibly related to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes. 
 
 3.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe which may be due to underlying
 tortuous vessels, but underlying lymphadenopathy or lesion cannot be excluded.
 
 
 A nonemergent chest CT with contrast can be obtained for further evaluation if
 no prior studies are available for comparison.
