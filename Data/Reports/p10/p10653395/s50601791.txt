                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate
 well-expanded lungs.  Heart is top normal in size.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  Linear bibasialr opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.
 No focal areas of consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax.  A PICC is again seen on the right, terminating in the mid SVC,
 similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
