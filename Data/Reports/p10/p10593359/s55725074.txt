 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm.  There are low lung volumes and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles could relate to low lung
 volumes or small pleural effusions.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
