                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and malaise with chills, sweats and urinary
 incontinence this morning.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there is minor left basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely mild left basilar atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.
