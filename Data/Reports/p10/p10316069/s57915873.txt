                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique.  On the left, there is a small pleural effusion with
 adjacent areas of band-like opacity suggesting coinciding atelectasis. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Surgical clips project over the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen. The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left-sided pleural effusion with suspected left basilar atelectasis.
