                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with LLL decreased breath sounds. AMS  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest.  Evaluation on the frontal view is
 limited due to patient's leftward rotation and patient's chin obscuring the
 left apex.  Allowing for this, there is plate basilar atelectasis and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The aorta is calcified.  The heart size cannot
 be assessed.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  The imaged bony structures
 appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
