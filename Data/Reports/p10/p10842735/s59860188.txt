                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:08 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma.  Chest pain and new oxygen requirements.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 A large bulge of the mediastinal contour in the right tracheobronchial angle
 is either a new lymph node or more likely very distended azygos vein which
 speaks to increased intravascular pressure or, less likely, volume.  This
 raises the diagnostic possibilities of either cardiac tamponade, which would
 explain a slight increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, or acute
 right heart strain from large scale pulmonary embolus.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Mild atelectasis at the left lung base is new, but are nonspecific
 finding.  There is a suggestion of widening of the mediastinum through the
 thoracic inlet, another manifestation of venous engorgement.  Findings were
 discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of dictation.
