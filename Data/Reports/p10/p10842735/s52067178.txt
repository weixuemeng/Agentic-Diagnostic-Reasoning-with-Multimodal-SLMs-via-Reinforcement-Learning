                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Melanoma with pericardial effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the large bulge to the right
 of the mediastinal contour at the level of the bifurcation is no longer
 visible.  This suggests that it had represented a distended azygos vein rather
 than a node.
 
 The overall cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.  There is no
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
