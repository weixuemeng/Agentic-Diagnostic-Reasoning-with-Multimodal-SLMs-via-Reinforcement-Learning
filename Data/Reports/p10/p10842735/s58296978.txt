  Low lung volumes exaggerate pulmonary structures. Enlarged cardiac silhouette
  which may be representative of a pericardial effusion. Left chest tube with no
  large pneumothorax but a small apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
  Bilateral atelectasis and mild edema.  Continued followup recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post left thoracotomy, pericardial window, evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is now with prior study performed at the earlier.
 
 There are lower lobe volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  This could
 represent of pericardial effusion.  Left apical chest tube is in place.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  Widening of mediastinum is partially  due to
 engorged vessels.  There is mild to moderate vascular congestion.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis are larger on the right side.
