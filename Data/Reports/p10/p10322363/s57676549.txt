                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new hypoxia in setting of ischemic colitis 
 // ? infiltrate / efussion / edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with left midlung atelectasis.  This results in crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures and apparent mild cardiomegaly.  No
 consolidation or pneumothorax seen.  No pleural effusions seen.  The
 visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The atelectasis in the left midlung.  Low lung volumes likely contribute to
 the findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
