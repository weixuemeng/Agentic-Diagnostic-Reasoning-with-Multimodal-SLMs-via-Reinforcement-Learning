                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ischemic bowel, given IVF, now with
 increasing oxygen requirement and bibasilar crackles.  // evidence of pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly improved when compared to the prior study.  There is
 persistent plate light atelectasis in the left lung base.  Subtle increased
 opacity at the right lung base likely reflect an additional area of
 atelectasis, infection cannot be excluded.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 within normal limits.  No pulmonary vascular congestion appreciated.  No
 pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. 
 Continued attention on followup recommended.
