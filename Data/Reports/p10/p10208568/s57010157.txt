                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate left pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate near total opacification of
 the left hemithorax, compatible with a large pleural effusion.  The left lower
 lobe is completely collapsed.  There is minimal aeration of the apical left
 upper lobe, in the left lung is otherwise atelectatic.  The left pleural
 fusion exerts mass effect upon the mediastinum, with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures.  The left lung appears clear, without right pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Surgical
 clips in the left axilla are consistent with previous axillary lymph node
 dissection .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion near complete atelectasis of the left lung and
 evidence of mass effect with rightward shift of mediastinal structures.
 
 The findings are concerning for malignant pleural disease and have been more
 fully assessed by outside chest CT of earlier the same date.
