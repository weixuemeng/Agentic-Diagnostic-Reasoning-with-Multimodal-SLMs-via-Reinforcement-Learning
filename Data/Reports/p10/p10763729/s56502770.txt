                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, on vent.  Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, and
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates appropriately
 positioned tracheostomy tube.  The right subclavian central venous line is 6cm
 below the carina and should be retracted by 15mm for more appropriate
 positioning.  Compared to the prior radiograph, there is worsening pulmonary
 edema with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Pericardial effusion is also a
 possibility to explain the increase in cardiac size. Worsening opacities in
 the perihilar and basilar regions, worse on the right, may also be explained
 by concurrent pneumonia.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Worsening pulmonary edema with enlarged cardiac size which may also be due
 to pericardial effusion. Follow up radiographs are recommended.
 2. Worsening bilateral parenchymal opacities, worse on the right, may also be
 explained by concurrent pneumonia.
