                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD on hemodialysis with previous chest x-ray showing nodular
 opacity.  Assess lung opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, the patient's fluid overload status has improved and there
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  The cardiomediastinal contour has improved in the interval. 
 Tortuous aorta is again noted.  The previously noted opacities at the right
 lung base may have been a function of engorge vasculature, and are no longer
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of pulmonary edema with no longer visualized
 right lower lobe opacities which may have been engorged vessels.
