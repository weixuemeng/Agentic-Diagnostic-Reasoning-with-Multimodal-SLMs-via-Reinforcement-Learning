                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right pleuritic chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Slightly tortuous descending
 aorta is noted.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No abnormality demonstrated within the limitations of the study technique.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be
 considered.
