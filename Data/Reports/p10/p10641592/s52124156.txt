                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities within the
 right lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Clips from
 prior cholecystectomy are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
