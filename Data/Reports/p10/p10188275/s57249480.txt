                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:58 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right pleural effusion.  Rule out pneumothorax
 after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is neither appreciable pleural effusion nor pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Right infrahilar opacification is most likely
 atelectasis, but is barely visible on the frontal radiograph.  Lateral view
 would be helpful in assessment.
