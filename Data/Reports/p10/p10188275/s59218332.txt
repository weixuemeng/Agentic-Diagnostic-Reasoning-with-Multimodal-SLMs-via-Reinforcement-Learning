 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, chronic heart failure.  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-existing right pleural effusion has improved.  The effusion is barely
 visible on today's image.  There is a small amount of pleural scarring and
 thickening at the right lateral aspects of the chest.  Minimal atelectasis at
 the lung bases.  Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.
