                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tracheomalacia:  Radiograph available from ___
 through ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 A right thoracostomy tube is unchanged in position. Subcutaneous gas across
 the right chest and neck has slightly improved since ___.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal borders remain minimally changed.  Lucency about the
 right cardiophrenic border is unchanged and remains difficult to differntiate
 between subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax.  Central pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild interstitial edema are stable.  A persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right cardiophrenic lucency may reflect pneumothorax or
 overlying subcutaneous emphysema, and remains unchanged since ___.  Lateral right neck and chest wall subcutaneous emphysema appear
 slightly improved.
 2.  Unchanged moderate left basilar atelectasis.
