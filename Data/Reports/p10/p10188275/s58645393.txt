                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD on home 3 liters O2, who
 presents for evaluation of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly, stable compared to exams dated back to
 at least ___.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise
 stable.  There appears to be an interval increase in opacification at the
 retrocardiac region and left lung base which could be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an infectious process cannot be excluded.  There has
 been a slight interval increase in a chronic small right pleural effusion as
 well as mild right basilar atelectasis.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased retrocardiac and left lung base opacification, likely secondary
 to atelectasis; however, an infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Slight interval increase in a chronic small right pleural effusion and
 mild right basilar atelectasis.
