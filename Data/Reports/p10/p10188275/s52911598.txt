                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheomalacia status post vertebroplasty.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to prior examination, there has been increase in subcutaneous gas
 tracking along the right hemithorax and now extending to the neck.  There is
 also unusually sharp demarcation of the right heart border with a thin rim of
 lucency near the cardiophrenic angle which may suggest a medial component of
 pneumothorax.  These findings in conjunction are worrisome for a left chest
 tube.  There is otherwise no change with persistent low lung volumes with
 associated atelectasis and mild vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increase in amount of subcutaneous gas in the right hemithorax as well as the
 lucency along the right heart border suggesting a medial component of
 pneumothorax. These findings are suggestive of a suboptimally functioning
 chest tube.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 11:56 on ___ at time of initial review.
