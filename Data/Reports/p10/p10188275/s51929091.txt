 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic recurrent dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 improved, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists but there is an increase in transparency of the lung parenchyma and a
 decrease in extent of the pre-existing opacities, notably at the right lung
 base.  At the right, however, parenchymal scarring and a minimal right pleural
 effusion persists.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Normal hilar structures.
