                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheoplasty, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is now a right chest tube in
 place without evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube tip lies
 approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Mild subcutaneous air is seen along
 the right hemithorax tracking upward into the supraclavicular fossa.  There is
 some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect some
 pleural fluid.
