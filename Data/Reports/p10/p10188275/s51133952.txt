                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Decreased widening of cardiomediastinal contours with heart size
 currently within normal limits.  Multifocal areas of atelectasis are again
 demonstrated, with interval improvement in the right upper lobe, but slight
 worsening at both retrocardiac regions.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 probably unchanged.  No visible pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the
 chest wall has partially improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved mediastinal widening, which was likely post-operative and
 projectional in etiology.
 2.  Worsening bibasilar atelectasis and persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
