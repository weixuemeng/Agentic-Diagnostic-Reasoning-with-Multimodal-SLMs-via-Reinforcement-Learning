                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with tracheobronchomalacia and COPD.  Assess for
 acute changes.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly and elongated aorta are unchanged.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion has probably increased allowing the difference in positioning of the
 patient.  Bibasilar atelectases have increased on the left.  Left perihilar
 plate-like atelectases are new.  There is no pneumothorax.
