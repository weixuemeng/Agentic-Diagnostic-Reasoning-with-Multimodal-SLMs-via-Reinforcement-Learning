                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously seen right lower lobe opacification has decreased
 substantially.  There has also been a mild decrease in the amount of vascular
 engorgement suggesting improvement in mild biventricular heart failure.  In
 retrospect, given the rapid change, the opacification likely represented fluid
 overload.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The sternal wires
 are intact and midline.  There is longstanding midline lucency in the
 manubrium and upper body is due to incomplete sternal fusion; there is no
 evidence of other incision complications. A PICC can be traced to the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Less opacification at the right lower; no evidence of pneumonia on today's
 radiograph.
