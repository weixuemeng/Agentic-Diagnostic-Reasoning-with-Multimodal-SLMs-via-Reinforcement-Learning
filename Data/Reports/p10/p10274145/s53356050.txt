                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Erratic blood sugars.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unchanged
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  No overt pulmonary edema is evident
 though chronic mild interstitial abnormalities are stable.  Faint
 opacification projecting over the left mid lung may represent developing
 infectious process.  There is no definitive correlate on the lateral
 radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.  Mild separation of
 superior aspect of sternotomy line with intact sternotomy sutures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint increased opacification in left mid lung may indicate
 developing infectious process. Could further evaluate with right anterior
 oblique view to further evaluate lung.
