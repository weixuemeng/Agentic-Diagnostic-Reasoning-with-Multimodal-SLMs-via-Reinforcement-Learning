                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  GI bleed, please evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Tortuous aorta.  No
 focal opacification concerning for pneumonia evident.  The bilateral
 costophrenic angles are not well seen; however, this is likely due to poor
 penetration due to body habitus rather than a definitive pleural effusion. 
 This area could be better assessed with a lateral chest radiograph. No osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral low lung volumes.  Poorly assessed costophrenic angles
 due to penetration could be further evaluated for pleural effusion with
 lateral view.
