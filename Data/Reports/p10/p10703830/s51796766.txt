  1. ETT terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.
  2. Diffuse reticular opacities likely are likely due to a combination of
  bronchovascular crowding and mild interstitial edema.
  3. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or aspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting for evaluation after overdose. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.
 Enteric tube extends to the body of the stomach.  Surgical clips are noted in
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 Bilateral reticular opacities likely represent a combination of
 bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes and mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Additional note is made of bibasilar opacities,
 left greater than right, which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.  Heart
 size is top-normal.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ETT terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.
 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
