  Increased bilateral consolidative airspace opacities, compatible with
  worsening multifocal pneumonia.  Small bilateral effusions appear similar to
  prior.  Multiple medical support devices in similar position to prior.  EAhn

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina
 with the neck in a flex position.  Other indwelling devices are unchanged in
 position.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities with relative sparing of the
 lung apices have slightly worsened in the interval and likely represent a
 combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, particularly considering the
 appearance on recent CT of one day earlier.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 not appreciably changed allowing for positional differences between the
 studies.
