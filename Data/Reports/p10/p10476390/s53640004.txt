 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is increased opacity over the spine and lateral view
 and obscuration of the descending thoracic aorta on the frontal view,
 compatible with a left lower lobe infiltrate.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation compatible with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Repeat after treatment is recommended to
 document resolution.
