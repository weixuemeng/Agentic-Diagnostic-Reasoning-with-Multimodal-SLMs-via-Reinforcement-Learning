                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with productive cough and fever/chills; history of
 multiple myeloma.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear normal.  The lungs demonstrate a linear opacity in the left
 lower lobe which may represent scarring, atelectasis, or less likely
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal
 degenerative change seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal evidence for pneumonia - more likely left lower lobe
 atelectasis or scarring.
