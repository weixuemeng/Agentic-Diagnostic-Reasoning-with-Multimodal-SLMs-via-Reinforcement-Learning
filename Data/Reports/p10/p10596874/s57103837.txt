                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear and
 the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted, which
 limits the detection for subtle fractures.  No grossly displaced rib fractures
 are present, and no other acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Diffuse osteopenia limits
 evaluation for subtle fractures, but no acutely displaced fracture is
 visualized.
