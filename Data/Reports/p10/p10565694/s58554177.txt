                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  please eval for ET tube placement, interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray  supine.  Lung volumes are low but ill-defined
 increased density bilaterally may represent vascular congestion and mild
 edema.  Likewise, widening of the pleural space on the right is concerning for
 pleural fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, limiting the quality of the study.  There is ill-defined
 increased density bilaterally in the pulmonary vasculature is indistinct. 
 There is some widening of the pleural space on the right.  There is streaky
 density in the lung bases and right mid lung consistent with subsegmental
 atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is prominent. An endotracheal tube is been
 inserted and ends of the thoracic inlet. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study demonstrating subsegmental atelectasis.  Ill-defined increased
 density bilaterally may reflect pulmonary vascular congestion.  Evidence for
 dependent right pleural effusion.  Endotracheal tube in place.
