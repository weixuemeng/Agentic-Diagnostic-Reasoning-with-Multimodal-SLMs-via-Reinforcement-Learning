  Severe cardiomegally. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, likely
  scarring or trace pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacification particularly at
  medial right lung base likely atelectasis, however aspiration/infection cannot
  be ruled out in the correct clinical setting.
  Findings discussed with dr. ___ at 6:55pm on ___ via tel.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and poor swallowing, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  This raises the
 possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion. 
 Basilar opacification bilaterally suggests small pleural effusions and volume
 loss in the lower lungs.  However, in the absence of a lateral view, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
