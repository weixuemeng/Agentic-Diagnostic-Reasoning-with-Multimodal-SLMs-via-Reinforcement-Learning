                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post cardiac surgery with right upper lobe
 collapse.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  The exam is
 limited by AP technique and poor penetration.  The tip of a right internal
 jugular catheter is near the confluence of the internal jugular and
 brachiocephalic veins.  Mediastinal drains are incompletely visualized. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  There is increased aeration of the right
 upper lobe.  The right minor fissure remains minimally elevated suggesting
 persistent right upper lobe volume loss.  There is a small amount of edema
 and/or atelectasis in the right minor fissure.  Moderate atelectasis and
 effusion are present at the left base.  Post-operative mediastinal widening is
 improving.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased aeration of previously collapsed right upper lobe with
 persistent signs of mild volume loss.
 2.  A possible right internal jugular catheter tip is positioned very
 proximally near the confluence of the internal jugular and brachiocephalic
 veins.
 
 Findings were discussed with ___ via telephone at ___ on ___, who confirmed that the patient's RIJ Cordis catheter will be removed
 shortly.
