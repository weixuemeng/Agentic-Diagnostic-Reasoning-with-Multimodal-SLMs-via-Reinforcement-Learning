                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure and bilateral pleural
 effusions, R > L  // please evaluate for interval changae
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extreme lower right chest wall costophrenic angle excluded from the film.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 5.0 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Clips and
 other radiopacities are noted in the region of the GE junction.  A left PICC
 or other line overlies the SVC/ upper right atrium.  A new dual-lumen central
 line catheter overlies the distal SVC and upper right atrium.  The previously
 seen right PleurX catheter has been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged, accentuated by
 rotated positioning .
 
 Again seen are small to moderate left and small right pleural effusions with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation, also similar to the prior study. 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right PleurX catheter and placement of right dual-lumen
 catheter.  Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
