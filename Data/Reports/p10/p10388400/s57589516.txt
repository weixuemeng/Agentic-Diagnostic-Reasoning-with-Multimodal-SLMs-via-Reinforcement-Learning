                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemia.  // Please evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube and the right- and left-sided chest tubes half been removed.
 
 A left IJ line tip overlies the brachiocephalic vessel and appears very
 slightly retracted compared with ___.   A left subclavian PICC line
 overlies the mid SVC.  An NG type tube is present, tip extending beneath
 diaphragm, off film.
 
 There is increased opacity at the right base, likely a combination of a
 pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  A small left
 effusion is likely larger.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is
 gross unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The heart is enlarged, though the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.
 There is mild upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, without other
 evidence of CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in right base opacity, consistent with effusion and
 collapse and/or consolidation.
 2. Small left effusion, which is likely larger.
 3. Left IJ central line tip overlies the brachiocephalic vessel and appear
 slightly retracted compared with ___.
