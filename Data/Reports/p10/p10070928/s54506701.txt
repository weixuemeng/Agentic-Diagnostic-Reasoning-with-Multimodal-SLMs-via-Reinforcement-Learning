                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute myelocytic leukemia, status
 post ___ cycles of chemo, last admitted on ___ with HCAP but discharged on
 room air.  Rhonchi at left base with hypoxia on room air.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding portable chest examination of ___.  Marked cardiac
 enlargement as before.  Bilateral basal densities exist that obliterate the
 diaphragmatic contours and obliterate the lateral pleural sinuses.  This
 matches the bilateral pleural effusion that extends into the posterior pleural
 sinuses as identified on the lateral view.  Congested pulmonary vasculature as
 before.  Comparison demonstrates a new rather extensive parenchymal infiltrate
 in the right upper lobe area consistent with an inflammatory infiltrate.  This
 pneumonic infiltrate is new in comparison with the preceding examination of
 ___.  Review of the chest CT examination of ___,
 demonstrates that this massive right upper lobe infiltrate did not exist at
 least to the same extent on that date.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic CHF, cardiac enlargement, new massive infiltrate in right
 upper lobe area.
