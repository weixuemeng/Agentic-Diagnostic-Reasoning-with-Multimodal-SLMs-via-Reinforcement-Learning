                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of bladder cancer, diagnosed with
 AML in ___, status post chemotherapy, who presents to the hospital with
 shortness of breath.  The patient remains afebrile on antibiotics.  Evaluate
 pulmonary infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___ and multiple prior chest x-rays,
 most recent of ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Pulmonary edema has improved. This
 could account for the improvement in the appearance of bilateral multifocal
 opacities. Multifocal opacities remain worst at the lung bases and are
 unchanged in distribution.  Small left pleural effusion has improved. Moderate
 right pleural effusion is stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Left PICC tip is difficult to see, but
 thought to end in the SVC. Metallic density just superior to the manubrium is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema which may account for the improvement in
 appearance of bilateral multifocal opacities.
