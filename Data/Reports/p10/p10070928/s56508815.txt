                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities appear progressed from prior exam. 
 Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Aortic
 arch calcifications are noted.  Metallic density projects over the trachea,
 compatible with a foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION: Interval progression of diffuse patchy pulmonary opacities,
 compatible with multifocal pneumonia - cannot exclude a component of pulmonary
 edema. Pleural effusions, small - moderate.
