                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, now hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 extent of the known bilateral inflammatory opacities and a slight increase in
 extent of a pre-existing and known left pleural effusion.
 
 The increase in diameter of the vascular structures appears to indicate mild
 fluid overload.
 
 Unchanged calcification projecting over the lateral aspects of the trachea.
 
 No other changes.
