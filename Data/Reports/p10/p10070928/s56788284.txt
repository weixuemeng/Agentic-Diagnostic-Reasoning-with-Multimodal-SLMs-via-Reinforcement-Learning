                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with AML, admitted for chemotherapy,
 confirm PICC line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size, thoracic aorta and mediastinal
 structures unchanged.  No advanced pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. 
 The next preceding portable chest examination of ___, identified
 pulmonary parenchymal densities overlying the right lower lung field has
 cleared and the chest findings are now similar to what has been shown on the
 frontal view of the PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  A
 left-sided PICC line was already identified on that examination, well detected
 on the lateral view and seen to overly the superior mediastinal structures on
 the frontal view, so to be located within the SVC at the level 2 cm above the
 carina.  Although the quality of the portable chest examinations are not
 identical and the PICC line less contrast prominent as the wire apparently has
 been removed, the line appears to be in unchanged position. No pneumothorax is
 identified in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparently unchanged position of previously identified left-sided
 PICC line seen on PA and lateral of ___ and AP single view examination
 of ___.
