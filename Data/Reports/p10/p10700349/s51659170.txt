                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with reported Langerhans cell histiocytosis of
 skin involving right and left medial canthus areas.  // Rule out pulmonary
 findings suggestive of LCH.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal
 hilar and mediastinal structures.  No evidence of pulmonary nodules or
 cavities.  No signs of fibrosis.  No pleural effusions.
 
 If clinical suspicion for lung on cell histiocytosis persists, CT should be
 performed, given the higher sensitivity of this technique to detect subtle
 lesions.
