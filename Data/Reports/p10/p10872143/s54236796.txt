                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Underlying mucinous appendiceal carcinoma, now with worsening right
 lower lobe consolidation and effusion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___, and a CT chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been slight interval worsening of a right-sided moderate pleural
 effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.  The remainder of the right upper
 lobe and left lung are essentially clear without focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains top normal in size, likely
 secondary to a small pericardial effusion as seen on recent chest CT, and is
 unchanged as compared to the prior chest x-ray.  Redemonstrated is a right
 subclavian central venous line, seen terminating within the proximal SVC. 
 There is no evidence of acute bony abnormality.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval worsening of a moderate right lower lobe pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis.  
 
 2.  Stable, mild enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
