 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular distension appears
 similar.  Interval resolution of left basilar opacities and partial clearing
 of right mid and lower lung opacities.  The latter most likely represent
 resolving atelectasis, but coexisting infectious consolidation in the right
 lower lobe is also possible.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
