                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___ of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly progressed in the interval, as well
 as bibasilar lung opacities, left greater than right.  The latter likely
 reflect atelectasis, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration and
 developing infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.
