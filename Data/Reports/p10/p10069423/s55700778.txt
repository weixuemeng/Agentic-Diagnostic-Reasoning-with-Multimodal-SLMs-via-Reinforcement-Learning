 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is a small left pleural effusion. 
 Left basilar opacities are noted.  Mild perihilar vascular congestion is
 noted.  Otherwise, hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart
 size is normal.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects
 over mid SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left pleural effusion.  Perihilar vascular congestion.  Bibasilar
 opacities, likely atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
