                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with dyspnea  // Please evaluate for pneumonia, edema,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there are new bilateral parenchymal opacities.  Specifically
 there is focal consolidation lateral to the left hilum and silhouetting of the
 medial left hemidiaphragm with a retrocardiac opacity.  Increased interstitial
 opacities are seen scattered throughout both lungs.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities with more confluent consolidation in
 the left lower lobe and left perihilar region.  Infection would be of greatest
 concern given rapid interval development.  Followup will be necessary to
 ensure resolution.
