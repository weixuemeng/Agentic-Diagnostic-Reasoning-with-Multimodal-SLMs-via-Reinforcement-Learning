 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:05 AM
  Lung volumes remain low.  Evaluation of the left mid lung is limited secondary
  to the superimposed cardiac device.  There is probably a minimal increase in
  edema, probably still mild with persistent moderate to severe cardiomegaly. 
  Right lower lung atelectasis has increased.

 No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion, no mediastinal widening.

 been no change in the position of left trans subclavian right atrial
 biventricular pacer defibrillator leads, continuous from the left pectoral
 generator.
