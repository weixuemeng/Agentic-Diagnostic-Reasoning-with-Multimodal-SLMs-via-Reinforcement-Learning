 Triple lead left-sided AICD is stable in position.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are also stable. 
 There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased right perihilar
 opacity as compared to the left may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 however, infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
