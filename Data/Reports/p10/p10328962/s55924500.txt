                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  This study is read in conjunction with concurrently obtained CTA
 of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well expanded. 
 Small consolidative regions at both lung bases are probably scarring or
 atelectasis, less likely small foci of pneumonia or bronchioloalveolar
 carcinoma. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to confirm chronicity by
 obtaining prior chest radiographs. Failing that, I would suggest followup
 chest radiographs in six months.  The heart is top-normal in size and the
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal opacity concerning for
 pneumonia.  A tendon anchor is present in the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probably no acute cardiopulmonary process. Bibasilar lung abnormalities need
 additional imaging (see above) before they can be considered chronic and
 intert.
