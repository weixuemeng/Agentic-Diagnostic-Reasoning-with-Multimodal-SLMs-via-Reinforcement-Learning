                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available, due to PACS error. 
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear with linear opacities in the right lower lung which is unchanged and may
 reflect an accessory fissure with surrounding atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation is seen to suggest infectious process.  Linear right upper lung
 opacities and accompanying pleural thickening may relate to prior radiation
 therapy. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
