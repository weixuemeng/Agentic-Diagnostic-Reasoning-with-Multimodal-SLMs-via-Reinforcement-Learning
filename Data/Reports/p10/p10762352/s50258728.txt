                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of aortic stenosis status post mitral valve replacement
 presenting with worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement, as before.
 There is a new moderate new left-sided pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis in basilar parts of the left lower lobe with lesser opacities also
 suggesting partial areas of atelectasis in the superior segment and lingula.
 Opacification of the posterior right lower hemithorax, however, has resolved.
 Background lung parenchyma appears within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial new left-sided pleural effusion with areas of opacification and
 volume loss, probably compatible with atelectasis, although not entirely
 specific.
