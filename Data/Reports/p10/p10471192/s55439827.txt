 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  A
 tracheostomy tube is seen in place.  There is a well-circumscribed rounded
 opacity along the medial left lung base which appears more prominent, compared
 to the prior exam. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The bones are
 diffusely osteopenic, which are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded opacity at the left lung base appears more prominent compared to the
 prior exam. This raises concern for diaphragmatic herniation or possibly
 rupture.  Further imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful. No evidence of
 pneumonia.
