                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-op for carotid endarterectomy.
 
 CHEST, 1 VW
 
 A dual lead left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium
 and right ventricle.  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  The
 right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  There is no CHF, focal
 consolidation, or effusion on this single frontal portable view.  Of note,
 there appears to be a calcified right paratracheal lymph node and a focal
 calcified granuloma with pleural thickening at the right lung apex, 
 suggesting prior granulomatous disease.  Linear metallic density overlying
 lower mediastinum appars to represent an EKG clip. 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Findings suggestive of prior granulomatous disease, with right apical
 scarring and slight right-sided volume loss.
 3. Doubt acute pulmonary process.
