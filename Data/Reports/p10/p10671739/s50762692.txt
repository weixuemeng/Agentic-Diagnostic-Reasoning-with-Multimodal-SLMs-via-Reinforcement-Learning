                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New NGT placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, KYPHOTIC POSITIONING:  
 
 No NG tube is seen extending through the mediastinum or extending beneath the
 diaphragm.  There is coiled tubing over the upper mediastinum, which may
 reflect coiling of the NG tube in the patient's upper esophagus and
 retropharynx.  Background COPD, mild vascular plethora, bibasilar atelectasis,
 and equivocal small effusions noted.  Left-sided dual-lead pacemaker noted. 
 The uppermost chest is obscured by patient's chin.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube appears to be coiled in the upper esophagus and pharynx
 and needs to be repositioned.  At this time, there is a follow-up film from
 ___ at 18:48 p.m. that shows repositioning of the orogastric tube.  Please
 see separate report of that exam.
