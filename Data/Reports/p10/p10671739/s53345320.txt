                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 15:19 p.m., the orogastric tube has been
 re-positioned. The tube type tuis now seen coursing through mediastinum, with
 radiopaque tip overlying the expected position of the gastric fundus. The
 radiopaque tip does not extend beyond the pylorus. 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora,
 with small effusions and possible minimal underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The upper zone redistribution is probably slightly worse. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
