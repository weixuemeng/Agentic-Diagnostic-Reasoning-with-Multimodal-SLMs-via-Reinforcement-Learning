 INDICATION:  ___M with dizziness  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest wall port this again seen with catheter tip in the right atrium.
 There are linear bibasilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis. The lungs
 are otherwise clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 The expected contour of the lateral left scapula is not seen and is suspicious
 for metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear bibasilar opacities most likely atelectasis although infection is not
 entirely excluded. Progressive destruction of the left scapula worrisome for
 metastatic disease.
