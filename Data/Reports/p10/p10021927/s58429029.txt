                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, and chest CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Extensive
 parenchymal opacities have mostly resolved since the prior examination,
 primarily leaving bronchovascular opacity in the right lower lobe which can
 probably be attributed atelectasis, as well as suspected residual retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  However, there is no further evidence for parenchymal edema or
 significant pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked improvement in pulmonary opacities with suspected residual atelectasis
 in the posterior lower lobes, but no definite acute process.
