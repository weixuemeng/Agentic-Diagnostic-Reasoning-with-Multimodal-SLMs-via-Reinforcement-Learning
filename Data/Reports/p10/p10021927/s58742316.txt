 As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated. The
 nasogastric tube was removed. The lung volumes have decreased, revealing new
 sounds of parenchymal atelectasis at the lung bases. The pre-existing
 parenchymal opacity in the perihilar lung regions on the left is overall
 unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural effusions.
 The overdistension of the transverse colon is constant in appearance.
