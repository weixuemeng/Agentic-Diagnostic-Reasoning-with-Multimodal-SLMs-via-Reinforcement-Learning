                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new o2 requirement  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes persist.  New since the prior study is interstitial opacity
 over the right lung worrisome for asymmetric pulmonary edema or infection. 
 Right base atelectasis is seen.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The right
 colon is again interposed anterior to the liver.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacity projecting over the left lung could be due to very asymmetric
 pulmonary edema although more concerning for infectious or inflammatory
 process.
