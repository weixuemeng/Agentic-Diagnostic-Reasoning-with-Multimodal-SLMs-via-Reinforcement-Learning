                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is difficult
 to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the
 left and small on the right.  Heart size is likely mildly enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No large
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate left and small right pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
