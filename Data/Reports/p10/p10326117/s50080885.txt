                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right.  Evaluation of the lower lung fields and cardiac silhouette is
 limited in this setting, but there is likely bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis.  Aortic knob calcification and descending aortic calcification is
 seen.  The visualized portions of the upper lung fields demonstrate no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Diffuse osteopenia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.  Underlying
 consolidation from infection cannot be excluded.
