                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is redemonstration of intact sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips,
 consistent with prior CABG.  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 without frank interstitial edema.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged, not significantly changed.  The descending thoracic aorta
 is tortuous, as before.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted. 
 A large right breast calcification is unchanged.  A surgical clip projects
 over the upper abdomen on the lateral projection, likely related to prior
 cholecystectomy given its infrahepatic location on the comparison radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congesion, without frank interstitial edema.  No
 focal consolidation.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
