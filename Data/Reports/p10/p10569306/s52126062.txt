                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The main
 pulmonary artery contour is slightly prominent, but there is no evidence for
 pulmonary edema.  A nipple shadow is again seen on the left.  Patchy basilar
 opacity suggest minor atelectasis or perhaps scarring which appears unchanged.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities suggesting minor atelectasis without definite
 evidence for pneumonia.
