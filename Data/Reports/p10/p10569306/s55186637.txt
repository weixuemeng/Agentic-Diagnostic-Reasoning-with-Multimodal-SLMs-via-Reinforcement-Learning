                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low which limits evaluation.  There is
 subtle haziness in the right lower lung which could represent underpenetrated
 technique, though the possibility of a partially layering right effusion is
 not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left lung appears clear.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  Clips are noted in the superior mediastinum,
 unchanged.  There is a calcified rounded structure again noted in the right
 upper quadrant compatible with hepatic lesion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, subtle haziness in the right
 lower lung which may represent a partially layering right effusion.
