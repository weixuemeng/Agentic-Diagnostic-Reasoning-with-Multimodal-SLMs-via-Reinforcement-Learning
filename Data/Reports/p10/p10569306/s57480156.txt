                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with dyspnea and history of congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral increased reticular opacities throughout the lungs
 consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears enlarged in comparison to prior study.  Additionally, focal
 opacity is noted overlying the right hemithorax.  There are bilateral small
 pleural effusions. The lungs are without pneumothorax.  No acute fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Evidence of heart failure with enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette as
 well as moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
 2.  Focal opacity in the right lower lobe may be representative of
 atelectasis, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or pneumonia.  
 3.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
