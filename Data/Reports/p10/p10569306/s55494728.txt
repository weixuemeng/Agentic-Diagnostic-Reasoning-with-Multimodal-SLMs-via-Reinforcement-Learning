                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleuritic right chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, increased since the prior study.  A small left pleural effusion
 is also seen, which is grossly stable to possibly slightly increased as
 compared to the prior study.  Prominence of the hila is stable, as compared to
 ___ and may relate to vascular engorgement.  The right aspect of the
 cardiac border is difficult to assess due to the right-sided opacity.  The
 left aspect of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Rounded calcified structure again projects over the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, increased on the
 right and stable to possibly slightly increased on the left.  Right base
 opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but
 consolidation is not excluded.  Prominence of the hila possibly due to
 vascular congestion is again seen.
