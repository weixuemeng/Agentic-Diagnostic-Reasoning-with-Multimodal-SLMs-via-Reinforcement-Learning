                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dullness at right base.  Question pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion, likely
 slightly increased since previous exam.  Minimal blunting of the left
 posterior costophrenic angle also suggests small left pleural effusion. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Posterior right seventh rib fracture is again seen.  Peripherally calcified
 lesion in the right upper quadrant is known to be hepatic in origin. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval enlargement of the right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Likely associated atelectasis, noting that infection cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Persistent small left effusion.
