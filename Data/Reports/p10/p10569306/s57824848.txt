                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ESRD, afib, Evaluate opacities in the lungs seen in prior
 study performed 11 hours earlier.
 
 There has been marked improvement in now mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 
 opacities in the lower lobes could be asymmetric dependent edema and/or
 atelectasis.  Continued follow-up is recommended to exclude focal pneumonia. 
 There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small
 right pleural effusion.  A left pleural effusion has improved, may be
 resolved.  Cardiomediastinum is stable.
