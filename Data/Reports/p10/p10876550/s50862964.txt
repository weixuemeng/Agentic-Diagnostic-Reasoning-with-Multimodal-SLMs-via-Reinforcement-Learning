 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:55 AM
  
  
  
  Compared with prior study of ___ at 21:28 and 12:42 there has
  been progressive opacification of the left hemi thorax.  This is likely
  related to effusion and possibly some degree of atelectasis as there is
  possible shift of the mediastinum to the left; although, the film is rotated. 
  There may be a component of asymmetric pulmonary edema in the left lung as
  well.  ET tube, NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and chest and mediastinal drainage
  catheters in expected position.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone
  on ___ at 1:21 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // evalute for Left pleural
 effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent study of a few hr earlier, a moderate to large left pleural
 effusion has apparently increased in size with indwelling chest tube in place.
 Adjacent worsening left mid and lower lung opacity likely reflects atelectasis
 related to the effusion.  No other relevant changes since recent study.
