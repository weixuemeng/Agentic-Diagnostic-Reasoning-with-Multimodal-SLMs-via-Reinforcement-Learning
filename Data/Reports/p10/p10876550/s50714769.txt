                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval for effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a moderate sized partially
 loculated left pleural effusion has substantially increased in size with
 associated worsening atelectasis at the left base.  A left chest tube remains
 in place.  Intra-aortic balloon pump has apparently been removed.  No other
 relevant changes.
