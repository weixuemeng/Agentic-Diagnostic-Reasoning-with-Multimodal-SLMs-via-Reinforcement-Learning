                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain. Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker is again noted, with leads in standard positioned.
 Aortic and mitral valve prostheses are present.
 
 Status post sternotomy. The heart is mild enlarged but unchanged.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. No gross pleural effusion.
 Retrocardiac opacity is noted. No pneumothorax.
 
 Densities, including nodular densities, seen on the ___ chest CT,
 are not well appreciated radiographically. The previously described partially
 calcified nodule is faintly visible in the right mid zone laterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity is presumably atelectasis, however, pneumonia should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Densities, including nodular
 densities, seen on the ___ chest CT, are not well appreciated
 radiographically.
