                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Images
 are slightly limited due to the patient's body habitus.  Lung volumes are low.
 The heart is mildly enlarged, not significantly changed compared to the prior
 study from ___, allowing for differences in patient rotation.  There
 are diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities with a perihilar predominance,
 most likely mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is subsegmental
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar in
 appearance to the prior radiograph from ___.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The vascular pedicle is
 widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly. 
 Widening of the vascular pedicle suggestive biventricular failure.
