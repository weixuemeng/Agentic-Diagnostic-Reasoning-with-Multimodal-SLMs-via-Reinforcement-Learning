                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Exam is limited secondary to
 body habitus and low inspiratory effort.  However, when compared to prior,
 there is increased right basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm
 suspicious for effusion.  There are also hazy opacities in lungs suggesting
 pulmonary edema.  There is no large left effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess as its right margin is not visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of pulmonary edema.  Right basilar opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm could be due to effusion, underlying infection
 not excluded.
