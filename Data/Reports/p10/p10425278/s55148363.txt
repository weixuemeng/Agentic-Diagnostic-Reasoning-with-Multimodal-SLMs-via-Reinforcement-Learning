                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after right lower lobectomy.  Chest tube
 discontinued.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 A small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax, level of the third posterior
 interspace, and the degree of rightward mediastinal shift and small pleural
 effusion are all stable since ___, 12:30 p.m.  Small left pleural effusion
 also unchanged.  Left lower lobe cleared.  Left upper lobe may be developing
 early consolidation.  Followup advised.  Heart size normal.  
 
 A volume of pleural fluid at the base of the right hemithorax is largely
 posterior and could be subpulmonic, but unchanged for the past several days. 
 This is difficult to distinguish from atelectasis in the right middle lobe and
 if that becomes an issue, then CT scanning would be required.
