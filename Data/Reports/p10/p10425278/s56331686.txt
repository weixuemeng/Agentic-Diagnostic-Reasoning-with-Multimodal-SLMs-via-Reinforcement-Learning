                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lobectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right pneumothorax has
 effectively cleared.  Post-surgical changes are again seen with continued
 opacification at the right base consistent with some combination of
 atelectasis and pleural fluid.  The effusion at the left base has cleared and
 the left lung is essentially clear at this time.
