                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening back pain and lower extremity
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities may be due to atelectasis or scarring.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mid thoracic compression deformity is seen,
 age indeterminate without prior exam.  Osseous structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.  Slight contour irregularity at the left lateral aspect of
 the trachea at the thoracic inlet possibility from underlying thyroid
 enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Age-indeterminate mid thoracic compression deformity.
 
 3.  Slight contour deformity of the left lateral aspect of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet, raising possibility of underlying thyroid enlargement. 
 Ultrasound can be performed if desired and not already done.
