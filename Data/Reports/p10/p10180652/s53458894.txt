                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain for one hour, radiating
 down his arm.  Evaluate for pneumonia or mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 The lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. 
 Increased opacity at the left lower lobe is likely atelectasis and crowding of
 vessels, although it could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is within normal limits allowing for technique. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  The patient is status
 post right upper extremity amputation.  A left chest port catheter ends in the
 distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis but could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Per discussion with Dr. ___ (ED physician), there is little clinical
 concern for pneumonia.
