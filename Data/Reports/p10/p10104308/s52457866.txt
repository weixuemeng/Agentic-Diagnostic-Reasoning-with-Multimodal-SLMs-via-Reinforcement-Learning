 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dialysis, new cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate fluid overload, combined to cardiomegaly and a small right

 atelectasis that pre-existed is less severe than on the previous exam.  No
 newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
