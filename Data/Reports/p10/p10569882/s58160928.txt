                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___, AT 17:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Dobbhoff in place due to dysphasia, new
 onset tachypnea, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___, at 17:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of a feeding tube with the tip in the proximal small bowel.
 Clips in the right upper quadrant are seen, consistent with cholecystectomy. 
 Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized mid-to-lower lumbar spine. 
 There are two approximately 1 cm ill-defined patchy opacities in the right
 upper lung which have developed since the prior study and therefore may
 represent areas of early aspiration or infection.  In a patient with multiple
 comorbidities, emboli should also be considered.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may represent
 pleural thickening or a small effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcification of the aorta,
 consistent with atherosclerosis.
