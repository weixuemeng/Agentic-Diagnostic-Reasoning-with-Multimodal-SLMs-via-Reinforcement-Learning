 Left lower lobe opacification unchanged, presumably atelectasis, possibly
 secondary to bronchial displacement by hiatus hernia.  Left pleural effusion
 is small.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube
 traverses hiatus hernia into the stomach.  Right jugular line ends low in the
 SVC.
