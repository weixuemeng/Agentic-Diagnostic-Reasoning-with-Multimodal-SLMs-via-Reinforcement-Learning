 INDICATION:  Lightheadedness and cough. Evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 opacity at the right heart border just inferior to the right pulmonary hilum
 is unchanged in overall appearance from CXR from ___ years ago and again has no
 correlate on the lateral view. This may reflect an area of scarring, or
 anomalous vasculature though underlying mass is difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

 unchanged from prior chest radiograph. For definitive characterization, a
