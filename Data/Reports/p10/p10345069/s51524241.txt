                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CABG, Dobbhoff, evaluation for Dobbhoff tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff has been
 re-positioned.  The course of the tube is now unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  There still is a loop
 seen over the neck, but this might be a projection from a tube part outside of
 the body.  No complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise unchanged
 chest radiograph.
