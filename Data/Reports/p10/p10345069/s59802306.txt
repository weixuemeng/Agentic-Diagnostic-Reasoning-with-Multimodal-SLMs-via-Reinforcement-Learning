  in the stomach but tip not seen, and left picc tip at the cavoatrial ___ (d/w

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 4:41 p.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is currently 3.6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Widespread parenchymal
 opacities appear to be unchanged/slightly worsened since the prior study, most
 likely consistent with pulmonary edema, continued surveillance is recommended.
 No overt pneumothorax is noted.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, at
 least small but most likely small to moderate. Left picc tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.
