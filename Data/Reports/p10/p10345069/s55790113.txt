                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Eight days after CABG, followup of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the
 Dobbhoff tube.  The left PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The sternal wires are unremarkable. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate, most likely decreased in size since
 the prior study.  Minimal vascular engorgement is noted, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
