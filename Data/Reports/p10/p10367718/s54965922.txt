                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Question widened mediastinum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There appears to have been interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette when
 compared to the prior study.  Uncertain how much of this may be projectional
 or related to technical factors.  Although the appearances are not of a
 globular heart, pericardial effusion would need to be considered.
 
 The lungs are grossly clear.  There is arguably an old rib fracture of the
 left sixth rib.  There is indistinctness in the left costophrenic sulcus and a
 small effusion here is not excluded.  Mild irregularity in this region was
 previously visualized, the appearances could reflect the patient's known
 epipericardial fat pad.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No definitive acute cardiopulmonary findings.
