                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with long smoking hx, quit ___ yrs ago  //
 dyspnea x past year, getting worse      dyspnea x past year, getting worse
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Long-standing relative hyperlucency of the left lung compared to the right
 could be due to differences in soft tissue bulk, for example patient has had
 prior partial mastectomy or has had a left-sided cerebral vascular accident.
 Alternatively the explanation could be a chronic condition known as
 bronchiolitis obliterans which I would not expect to progress. Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes, pulmonary
 vasculature, and pleural surfaces are normal.  Thoracic aorta is generally
 calcified but not clearly aneurysmal.
