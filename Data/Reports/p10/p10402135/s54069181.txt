                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, shortness of
 breath, right lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Additionally, there is right
 upper lobe consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and not
 optimally assessed due to the adjacent bibasilar opacities.  Perihilar
 prominence and indistinctness of the hila while not well evaluated, could
 relate to fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacity may represent a combination of effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidations are not excluded and may be
 present.  Additional right upper lobe consolidation worrisome for infection. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and possible central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Findings could represent CHF with superimposed pneumonia.
