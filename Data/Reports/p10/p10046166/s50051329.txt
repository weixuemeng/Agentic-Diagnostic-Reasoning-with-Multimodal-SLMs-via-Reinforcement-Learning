                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic melanoma, presenting
 with confusion and somnolence.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral view somewhat limited due to overlying motion artifact. The
 lungs are low in volume.  There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  A 1.2-cm calcified granuloma just below the medial aspect of the
 right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior study.  No pleural effusions or
 pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The inferior sternotomy wire is fractured but unchanged. Surgical clips and
 vascular markers in the thorax are related to prior CABG surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
