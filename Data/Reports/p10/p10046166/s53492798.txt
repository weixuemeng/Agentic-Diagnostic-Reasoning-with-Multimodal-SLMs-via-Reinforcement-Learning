                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic melanoma, now with
 recurrent seizures and lethargy, comes here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest redemonstrate a round
 calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base, unchanged from
 multiple priors and consistent with prior granulomatous disease.  A known
 enlarged right hilar lymph node seen on CT of ___ likely accounts for the
 increased opacity at the right hilum.  A known right mediastinal lymph node
 conglomerate accounts for the fullness at the right paratracheal region.  No
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation is present.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged from the preceding radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
