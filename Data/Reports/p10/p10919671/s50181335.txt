                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bullous emphysema, status post left VATS
 bullectomy on ___.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The previously
 seen left mid lung bleb and right mid lung bulla are again demonstrated,
 however there is interval resolution of the previously seen air-fluid level
 within the left mid lung bulla.  Evidence of prior left apical bullectomy is
 again seen with persistence of moderate left pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 consolidation or significant pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval resolution of air-fluid level in the left mid lung bulla
 and persistence of moderate left pneumothorax status post left apical
 bullectomy.  Otherwise, unchanged since the prior study.
