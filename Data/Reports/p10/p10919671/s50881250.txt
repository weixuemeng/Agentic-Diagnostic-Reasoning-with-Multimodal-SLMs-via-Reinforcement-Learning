                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ON ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bullous emphysema, status post left
 VATS bullectomy, now with chest tube removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left chest tube with some residual subcutaneous
 emphysema within the lateral chest wall soft tissues.  There continue to be
 bilateral parenchymal opacities and distortion in both lungs consistent with
 known history of bullous emphysema.  On the left, there continues to be
 loculated areas of pneumothorax as well as a fluid level posteriorly, which
 represents a loculated hydropneumothorax.  More rounded opacity in the left
 mid to lower lung is also stable.  Overall, there is no significant interval
 change in appearance of the left lung.  Evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours is challenging due to the diffuse lung disease but is
 likely stable.
