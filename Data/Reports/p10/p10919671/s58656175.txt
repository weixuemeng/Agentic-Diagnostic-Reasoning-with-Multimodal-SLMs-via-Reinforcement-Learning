 The two chest tubes on the left are in place, unchanged in location.  There is
 slight interval increase in left pneumothorax with still substantially
 atelectatic left lung.  Right middle lobe atelectasis has slightly improved
 and there is only minimal atelectasis still present in the right lower lobe.
