 nodules
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Catheters in the right supraclavicular central venous dialysis set end in the
 region of the superior cavoatrial junction and mid right atrium respectively.
 
 There is the suggestion of a space occupying process separating the vertical
 aspect of the hemodialysis catheter from the trachea at the thoracic inlet. 
 This could be a hematoma, presumably long-standing, or an enlarged thyroid, or
 even a very enlarged parathyroid gland.  Mediastinum is otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural abnormality.
