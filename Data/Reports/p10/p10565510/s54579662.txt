                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post third renal transplant on
 ___, who presented with symptomatic cholelithiasis with increasing LFTs. 
 Concern for CMV hepatitis in addition to cholelithiasis.  Now with epigastric
 pain radiating to back with chest tightness, assess for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP single chest view was obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Again there is mild degree of cardiac enlargement
 without typical configurational abnormality.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested and there is no evidence of pleural effusion as the lateral pleural
 sinuses are free on this portable examination.  Observed, however, that a
 chest CT of ___ showed a small amount of right-sided pleural effusion as
 well as minimal amount of pericardial effusion.  No new acute pulmonary
 infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  In
 comparison with the next previous portable chest examination of ___, no
 significant interval change can be identified.  Observed that there do not
 exist criteria for pulmonary vascular overload, but it can be stated that
 there is no evidence of significant increased pleural effusion, interstitial
 edema, or pulmonary alveolar edema.
