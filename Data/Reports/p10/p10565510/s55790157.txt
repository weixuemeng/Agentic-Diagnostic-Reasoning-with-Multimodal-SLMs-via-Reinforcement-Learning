                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of active chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities may relate to vascular crowding, although
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  There is slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, although a trace
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
