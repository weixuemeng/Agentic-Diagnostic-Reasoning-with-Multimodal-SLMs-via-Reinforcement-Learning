                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of very low lung volumes.  The sternal wires after sternotomy are in unchanged
 alignment.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  New on today's examination is
 slight dilatation of the vascular diameters, potentially reflecting mild fluid
 overload.  This finding is most striking on the lateral than on the frontal
 image.  No larger pleural effusions.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.
