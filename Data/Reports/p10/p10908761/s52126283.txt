                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Head and neck and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 low in volume with increased interstitial opacity consistent with the chest CT
 findings of interstitial lung disease.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted without
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours as well as
 cardiac size are unremarkable with post CABG changes noted.  The left rib
 fracture seen on CT is not identified on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with left lateral 6th rib fracture
 and interstitial lung disease better characterized on the concurrently
 obtained CT.
