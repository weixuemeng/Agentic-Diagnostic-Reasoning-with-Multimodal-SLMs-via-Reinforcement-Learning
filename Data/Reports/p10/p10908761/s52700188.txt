 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CABG, dropping hematocrit.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Low lung volumes. 
 Presence of bilateral areas of atelectasis.  Minimal fluid overload may also
 be present, as reflected by mild increase in diameter of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.
