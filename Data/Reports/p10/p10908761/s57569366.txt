 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Status post CABG. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  Unchanged
 position of the right internal jugular vein catheter.  The presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No focal parenchymal
 opacity suggesting pneumonia.
