                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Residual heterogeneous opacification in
 the axillary region of the right upper lobe could be due to pneumonia,
 particularly aspiration.  Careful followup advised.  Heart size is normal. 
 Pleural effusions are small, if any.  Chest radiographs on ___
 suggest pre-existing interstitial lung disease which is undoubtedly
 contributing to some of the pulmonary abnormality currently.  Of note, the
 patient had distended esophagus on that examination raising possibility of
 scleroderma or CREST syndrome.
