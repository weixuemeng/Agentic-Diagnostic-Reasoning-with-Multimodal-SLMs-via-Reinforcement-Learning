                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with persistent midsternal chest pain.  Question
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Low lung volumes again noted.  Increased interstitial
 markings throughout the lungs are again seen dating back to ___. 
 This could be due to chronic underlying lung disease and in part accentuated
 by portable technique and low lung volumes.  There is no confluent
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs, likely chronic.
