                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 The lung volumes are low, which likely exacerbate the worsened appearance of
 diffuse interstitial abnormality in comparison to prior studies.  However, the
 worsened appearance could also in part reflect progression of known pulmonary
 fibrosis (per OMR notes, demonstrated on prior Atrius CT), or superimposed
 interstitial edema or widespread atypical infectious process.  There is no
 associated effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Mild thoracic degenerative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsened diffuse interstitial abnormality compared to prior
 studies, which could reflect progression of chronic interstitial lung disease
 versus superimposed interstitial edema or atypical infectious process.
