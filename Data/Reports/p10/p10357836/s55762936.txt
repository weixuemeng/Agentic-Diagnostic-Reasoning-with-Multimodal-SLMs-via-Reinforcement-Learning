 The aorta is calcified.  Heart appears mildly enlarged.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Postsurgical changes are noted along the lower right
 hemithorax.  Bronchovascular irregularity suggests emphysema.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity suggests opacification in the left lower lobe with mild
 associated volume loss.  Mild loss in height of T12 is noted.

 Findings suggesting emphysema.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base, probably
 atelectasis but not specific.
