                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Urinary infection symptoms, confusion, and right lower lobe
 crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a mild interstitial abnormality
 most suggestive of pulmonary edema. However, opacities are more striking in
 the right lung, especially the right upper lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Opacities in the right
 lung suggestive of coinciding pneumonia. Short-term repeat radiographs may be
 helpful to reassess.
