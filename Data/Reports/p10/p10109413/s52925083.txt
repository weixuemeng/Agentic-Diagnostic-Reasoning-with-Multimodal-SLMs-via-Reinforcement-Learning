                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with back pain radiating to the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lungs are clear without confluent
 consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The thoracic
 aorta follows a tortuous course, though is non-aneurysmal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 If there is clinical concern for vascular pathology (aorta) as a cause of the
 patient's pain, recommend CTA of the chest for further assessment.
