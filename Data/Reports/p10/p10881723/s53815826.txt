                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, productive cough and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Mild interstitial edema is present
 with bilateral pleural effusions, which are small, left greater than right. 
 Focal opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right, and bibasilar ill-defined opacities which
 may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
