                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload and respiratory distress, question progression of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 5:15 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the ET tube and NG tubes appear to have been
 removed.  
 
 There is rotated lordotic positioning.  Allowing for this, the trachea appears
 diffusely narrowed.  There is prominence of the right paratracheal soft
 tissues, not accounted for by rotation.  There are low inspiratory volumes. 
 Allowing for this, the right hemidiaphragm is nonetheless elevated.  There is
 vascular plethora and mild diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting CHF.  There
 is some patchy opacity at the right base, improved compared with the prior
 film.  Patchy opacity at the left base is similar to the prior film, though
 there appears to have been some clearing in the upper zones bilaterally. 
 Possible small right effusion is also slightly less pronounced.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Interval removal of ET tube and NG tube.  
 2) Findings consistent with CHF. 
 3) Bibasilar opacities with possible small right effusion, but improved
 compared with the prior film.  
 4) Large cardiomediastinal silhouette, include prominent right paratracheal
 soft tissues, appears stable.  
 5) Diffuse tracheal narrowing suggested.  
 6) Elevated right hemidiaphragm again noted.
 
 Note: The mediastinal widening and narrowing of the trachea are concordant
 with findings seen on targeted review of a ___ chest CT.
