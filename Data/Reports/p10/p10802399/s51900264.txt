                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with cirrhosis, preop TACE.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The mediastinum is widened and the trachea is
 narrow in the mid portion this is due to the presence of soft tissue
 abnormality around the trachea, could be adenopathy or enlarged thyroid.  A
 nodular opacity projects in the left lower lobe medially measures 12 mm. 
 Otherwise, lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. 
 Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Widened mediastinum and
 nodular opacity in the left lower lobe warrant further evaluation with CT.
