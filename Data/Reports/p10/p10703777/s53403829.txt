                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Heterogeneity projecting over the right supraclavicular soft tissue
 is seen to represent infiltrated/extravasated contrast from contrast-enhanced
 CT attempted at an outside hospital 1 day prior.  Findings seen on subsequent
 chest CTA performed here.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob, hypoxia syncope // pulm edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There appears to
 be some prominence of the central pulmonary vessels, right greater than left,
 with abrupt narrowing of the distal pulmonary arterial vessels on the right. 
 Imaged osseous structures are intact.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 spine.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Area of relative
 lucency overlying the right supraclavicular region may be exterior to the
 patient or soft tissue edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pulmonary edema or other acute intrathoracic process.
 2. Area of relative lucency overlying the right supraclavicular region may be
 exterior to the patient or soft tissue edema.  Correlate with direct
 visualization.
