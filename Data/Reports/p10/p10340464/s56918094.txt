                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new aflutter and history of asthma  // New
 aflutter
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  Within the
 limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
 detected.  Possible mild background hyperinflation.  No CHF, focal infiltrate
 or effusion is detected.  No left-sided pneumothorax is detected.  Doubt but
 cannot entirely exclude a tiny right apical pneumothorax. There is a ___.4 mm
 diameter rounded opacity superimposed over the upper right heart border --
 this is seen only on the frontal view and most likely represents artifact.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragms.  The visualized portion of the left
 colon is grossly unremarkable.
 
 There is scoliosis, possibly slightly right convex at the level of T4/5 and
 left convex centered at T7/8.  Possible rotary component lumbar spine, not
 fully evaluated.  At the periphery of these films, minimal degenerative change
 in the cervical spine is noted, not fully evaluated.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heart size is borderline.
 2. Possible mild hyper inflation, though the diaphragms are not flattened.
 3. Doubt but cannot entirely exclude a right apical pneumothorax.  If there is
 clinical concern for pneumothorax, then an additional frontal view obtained at
 end- expiration of the respiratory cycle could help for further assessment.
 4. Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
 5. Scoliosis noted.
