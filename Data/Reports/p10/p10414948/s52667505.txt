                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with multiple rib fractures, evaluate
 rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  Thoracic
 aorta of ordinary dimension with some calcium deposits in the wall at the
 level of the arch.  No local contour abnormalities are identified.  Moderate
 elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm, similar as it existed on previous
 portable examination of ___.  No new pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormalities are seen.  Deformities of the axillary portions of third,
 fourth, and fifth rib on the right side are again noted, consistent with the
 previously described rib fractures.  Small local surrounding pleural
 thickenings are noted, but no remaining pneumothorax can be identified.  The
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free, thus no evidence of pleural
 effusion.
 
 When comparison is made with more remote chest examinations such as a PA and
 lateral chest examination ___ ___, a moderate elevation of the
 right-sided hemidiaphragm existed already at that time.  Thus, the
 high-positioned diaphragm is not related to the patient's recent trauma that
 caused the rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of previously described rib fractures.  No
 remaining pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No new pulmonary infiltrates.
