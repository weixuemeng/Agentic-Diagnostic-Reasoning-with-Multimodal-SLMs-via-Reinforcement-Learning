                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F h/o HTN, HLD, NSTEMI (___) on medical management, ischemic
 stroke (___) felt to be cardioembolic in nature ___ presumed pAF c/b
 hemorrhagic conversion, who presented as an OSH transfer after developing
 acute onset confusion and left-sided weakness with concern for recrudescence
 of prior stroke symptoms, now transferred to the FICU for management of shock
 ___ AF with RVR.  // increasing SOB with low urine output
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ 04:28 portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral lung volumes are low.  In comparison 04:28 portable chest
 radiograph, there is mild improvement of the small left pleural effusion and
 decreased level of opacification of the retrocardiac lung regions suggesting
 improved ventilation.  The right IJ is in stable position terminating in mid
 SVC.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are stable and
 unchanged from prior study.  No pneumothorax nor consolidation seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Since ___:28 chest radiograph, there has been mild improvement of small
 left pleural effusion and improved ventilation of the retrocardiac lung
 regions.  Otherwise, pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema are
 relatively unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Right IJ is in stable position in the mid SVC
