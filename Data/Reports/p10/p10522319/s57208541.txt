 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube was removed.  Currently, the lung volumes are normal. And,
 with the exception of very subtle non characteristic scars in the lung
 parenchyma, no other parenchymal abnormalities are noted. In particular, there
 is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette as well
 as the hilar and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.
