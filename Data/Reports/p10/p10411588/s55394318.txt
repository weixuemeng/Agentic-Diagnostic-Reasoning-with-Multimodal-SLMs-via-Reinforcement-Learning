                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior exam, the PICC has been pulled back.  The tip is now in the low
 SVC.  The lung volumes are low, which limits evaluation.  There appears to be
 mild vascular congestion without a definite focal opacity to suggest
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is
 unfolded and tortuous, similar to the prior exam.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to low lung volumes.  No definite pneumonia.
