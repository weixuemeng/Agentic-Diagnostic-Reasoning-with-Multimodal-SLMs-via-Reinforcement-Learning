                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is new from the prior
 chest radiograph, and has increased from a recent CT of ___,
 which demonstrated a small-to-moderate right effusion.  Adjacent opacities in
 right middle and right lower lobes most likely represent atelectasis, although
 infectious consolidation is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Small left pleural effusion is also present with adjacent left basilar
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for technical
 differences between the exams.  Several embolization coils overlie the right
 hemithorax, unchanged in position since the prior radiograph.
