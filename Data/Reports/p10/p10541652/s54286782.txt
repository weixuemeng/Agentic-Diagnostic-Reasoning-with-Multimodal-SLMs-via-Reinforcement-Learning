                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is persistent small bilateral pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  Slight increase in right base opacity may be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although developing consolidation is not
 excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Coils are again seen projecting over the right
 mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased opacity at the
 right lung base may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 although concern is raised for evolving consolidation.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
