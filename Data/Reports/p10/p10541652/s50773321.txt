                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hepatocellular carcinoma and pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lateral radiograph is limited due to oblique
 patient positioning.  Apparent mild improvement in a persistent moderate right
 pleural effusion is likely related to differences in patient positioning on
 the current study compared to ___.  Underlying right basilar atelectasis
 is unchanged.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Right apical scarring appears symmetrical.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  Embolization coils project
 along the right anterior mediastinum.  A large radiopaque lesion in the right
 hepatic lobe is compatible with the patient's known HCC status post TACE.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild apparent improvement in moderate right pleural effusion is
 likely related to patient positioning. Stable right basilar atelectasis.
