 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ AT 13:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hep C, HCC with hypoxia, worsening
 effusion, now status post diuresis, question infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:54.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 13:13 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided embolization coils are again seen.  There continues to be a
 moderate-sized right pleural effusion with some associated adjacent airspace
 process which likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  A smaller left effusion remains present with
 some streaky opacities at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  No pneumothorax.  A faintly calcified mass in the right upper
 quadrant corresponds to a hepatic calcified lesion as evident on the CT of
 ___.
