 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, as on prior.  Hazy retrocardiac opacity
 projects over the spine on lateral view.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. 
 Surgical clips are seen projecting over the left upper chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Follow-up chest radiograph to ensure resolution is
 recommended.
