 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously right lower lobe has substantially re-expanded. consolidation in
 that region may be transient, due to residual atelectasis and re-expansion
 edema, but should be followed to exclude developing pneumonia.  Heart size has
 increased, but still normal and there is greater distention of mediastinal
 veins and pulmonary vasculature, all pointing to increased intravascular
 volume.  No pneumothorax.
