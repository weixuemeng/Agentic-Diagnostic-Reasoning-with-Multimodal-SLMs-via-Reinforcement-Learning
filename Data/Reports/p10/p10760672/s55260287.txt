                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5
 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 substantial atelectasis of what appears to represent most of the right lower
 lobe although incomplete.  There is no convincing indication for substantial
 right middle or upper lobe atelectasis.  The left lung appears clear.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  Substantial right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be appropriate to reassess.
