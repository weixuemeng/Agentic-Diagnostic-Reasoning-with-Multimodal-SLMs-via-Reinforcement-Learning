                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SAH and cerebral edema with vomiting  //
 assess for aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 11:49.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior chest x-ray performed earlier on the same date,
 there is apparent worsening of the left lung base opacity, which is at least
 partially due to a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  However,
 given recent progression over the past several hours, aspiration should also
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No other relevant changes.
 The endotracheal tube, left subclavian line and enteric tube are unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening left lung base opacity, which may be due to underlying
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, but superimposed aspiration should
 be considered in the appropriate clinical context.
