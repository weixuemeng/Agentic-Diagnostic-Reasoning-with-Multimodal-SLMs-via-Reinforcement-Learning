                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, evaluate for infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Prominence of the interstitium is noted and
 is thought to reflect changes from chronic lung disease.  There is no vascular
 congestion and or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A 4 mm
 rounded opacity is seen in the right mid lung, only on the frontal view, is
 likely a calcified granuloma.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 2.  Diffuse interstial prominence without vascular congestion is thought to
 reflect changes of chronic lung disease rather than pulmonary edema.
