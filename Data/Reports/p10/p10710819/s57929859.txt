                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally with perihilar distribution suggests
 mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.  Atypical infection is not entirely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No lobar consolidation is seen.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest interstitial pulmonary edema, atypical infection
 is not entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
