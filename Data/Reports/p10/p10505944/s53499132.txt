                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status, fall one week ago.
 
 Correlation to right shoulder radiographs from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The lungs are overinflated with biapical hyperlucency,
 widening of the anteroposterior diameter, and increased retrosternal clear
 space, compatible with chronic obstructive airways disease. There is no focal
 consolidation.  Heart size is normal.  There are no pleural effusions,
 pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.  
 
 Bones are diffusely demineralized, with thoracic hyperkyphosis and multilevel
 bridging ossification, which could be consistent with ankylosing spondylitis
 in the correct clinical setting.  Again seen is a subacute, comminuted and
 impacted fracture of the right proximal humeral diaphysis, with 2 mm
 overriding and one-half shaft width medial displacement of the distal fracture
 fragment.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Emphysema.
 3.  Subacute proximal right humeral fracture.
