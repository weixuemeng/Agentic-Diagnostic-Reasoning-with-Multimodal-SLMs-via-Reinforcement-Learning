 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:34 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain, question acute
 cardiopulmonary process.

 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 7:34 is submitted.
 
 The heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There is linear opacity at the right base, which most likely
 represents post-inflammatory scarring as there appears to be some associated
 focal pleural thickening in this vicinity.  An acute infectious process would
 be much less likely.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right basilar linear opacity, likely post-inflammatory.  No evidence of an
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
