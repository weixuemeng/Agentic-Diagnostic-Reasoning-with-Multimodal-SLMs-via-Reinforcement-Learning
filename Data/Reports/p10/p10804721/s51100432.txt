                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p needle decompression with new chest tube
 // eval interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___ at 18:19.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of left chest tube, and near- resolution of
 left-sided pneumothorax, with possible small left apical pneumothorax not
 definitively visualized. A right-sided port is in stable position. The
 Dobbhoff tube again appears to overlie the trachea and enter the left mainstem
 bronchus, coursing inferiorly and in grossly unchanged position, with tip
 projecting over the mid left abdomen.
 
 The mediastinal silhouette is normal. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits
 of normal, however this evaluation is limited by the low lung volumes and AP
 projection.
 
 The right lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidation. There is a
 generalized diffuse hazy opacification of the left lung which likely
 represents re-expansion pulmonary edema. There are some areas of platelike
 atelectasis over the left lower lung.
 
 There is no right pleural effusion. There is no significant left pleural
 effusion, however left lateral CP angle is not seen on current radiograph,
 which limits evaluation for small effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval resolution of large left pneumothorax and mediastinal shift
 status post chest tube insertion.
 2. Unchanged appearance of malpositioned Dobbhoff tube which enters trachea
 and left mainstem bronchus, with tip in the left mid abdomen.
 3.  Re-expansion pulmonary edema of left lung.  Left lower lung platelike
 atelectasis.
