 interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:54
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the left pigtail pleural catheter. No pneumothorax is
 seen. Increasing consolidation in the left base most likely reflects
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. Right
 lung is low in volume and there appears to be increasing hazy opacity in the
 right upper medial lung which could represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or
 aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. The previously noted mild
 interstitial edema has improved. Nasogastric tube and right subclavian
 Port-A-Cath are unchanged in position.
