 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath and left apical pleural catheter are unchanged in
 position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  No pneumothorax. Mild perihilar interstitial edema appears
 somewhat improved.  More focal opacity at the left base likely reflects a
 combination of layering effusion and compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.
