 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:59 PM
  New large left pneumothorax with shift of mediastinal structures to the right.
  OG tube is malpositioned with a very unexpected course, deviating dramatically
  from midline and overlying the left lung before taking a subdiaphragmatic
  course.  Tip is not overlying the expected area of the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dobhoff placement  // dobhoff placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which projects over the
 trachea and appears to enter the left mainstem bronchus in course inferiorly,
 presumably penetrating the diaphragm and with distal tip projecting over the
 mid left abdomen. There is a large left pneumothorax with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures. There is stable position of right-sided port with
 distal tip projecting over cavoatrial junction.
 
 Allowing for changes due to mediastinal shift, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized.
 
 The left lung is collapsed against the left mediastinum secondary to large
 pneumothorax. The right lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidation.
 There is no right pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New large left pneumothorax with rightward mediastinal shift.
 2. Dobbhoff tube appearing to enter trachea and left mainstem bronchus, with
 diaphragmatic penetration and distal tip projecting over the left mid abdomen.
