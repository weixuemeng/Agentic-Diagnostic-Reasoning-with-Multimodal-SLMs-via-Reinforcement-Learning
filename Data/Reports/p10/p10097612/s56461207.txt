                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cardiomyopathy here with elevated troponin and SOB  //
 Pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___,
 echocardiogram report ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is severe and appears worsened on the frontal view compared to
 prior exams, although this may be partly accounted for by AP technique and
 rotation of the patient.  Increased prominence of the right upper mediastinal
 contour compared to prior is also noted and may also be in part technical. 
 The hilar contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Mild interstitial prominence is again seen without pulmonary edema.  There is
 no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Multiple wedge deformities of
 the thoracic spine are noted, including one in the lower thoracic spine which
 appears significantly progressed and another in the mid thoracic spine which
 is moderately progressed compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Severe cardiomegaly which appears worsened compared to prior, which may be
 in part technical.
 2.  Prominent right upper mediastinal contour, which likely correlates to
 known ascending aortic dilation.
 3.  Mild interstitial prominence consistent with vascular congestion.  No
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  Multiple wedge deformities in the thoracic spine, progressed from prior.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr.  ___ ___ the results in items 1 and 2 with Dr.
