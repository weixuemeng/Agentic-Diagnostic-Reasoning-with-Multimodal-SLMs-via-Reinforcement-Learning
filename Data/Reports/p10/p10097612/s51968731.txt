 opacity in the lingula is linear and suggests atelectasis.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are suspected.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is a
 mild lower thoracic wedge compression deformity that appears chronic and
 correlates with the prior CT findings.  Mild degenerative changes involve the
 right shoulder.
