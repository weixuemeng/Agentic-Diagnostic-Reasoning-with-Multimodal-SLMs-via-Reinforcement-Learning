                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable erect chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are remarkable for diffuse, multifocal opacities
 predominantly in the lower lungs.  Given clinical history, findings are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There is probably a small left pleural
 effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Multifocal pneumonia.
