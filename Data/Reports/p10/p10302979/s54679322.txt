                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and cough.  // ?infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker is noted in unchanged location with two leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits. Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch. Persistent, mildly
 hazy opacification of the bilateral lung bases is somewhat improved as
 compared to the prior examination, and may relate to underpenetration on
 technique. No definitive lobar consolidation is identified.  A subtle,
 somewhat nodular opacity overlying the left lower lobe is noted. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal lobar consolidation or pleural effusion is identified.
 2. Subtle, rounded opacity overlying the left lower lobe. Recommend repeat
 chest radiographs with nipple markers for further evaluation.
 3.  Persistent bibasilar hazy opacification is somewhat improved from the
 prior examination. Findings may represent underpenetration secondary to
 technique.
