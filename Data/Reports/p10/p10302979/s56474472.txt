 Mild diffuse calcification of the aortic arch is noted.  The trachea is
 midline.  The lungs are symmetrically expanded, with decreased volume from the
 most recent prior study.  Hazy opacification at the bilateral lung bases
 compared to the prior study may be related to underpenetration on technique. 
 No definite consolidation concerning for pneumonia is seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy opacification of the lung bases may be due to
