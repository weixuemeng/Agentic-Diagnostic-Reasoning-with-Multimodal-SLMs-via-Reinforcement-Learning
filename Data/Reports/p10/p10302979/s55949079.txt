                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette size remains top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution with pulmonary
 vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.
 No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis though infection is
 not completely excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
