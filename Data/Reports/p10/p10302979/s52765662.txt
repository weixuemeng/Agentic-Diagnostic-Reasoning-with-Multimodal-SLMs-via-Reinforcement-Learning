                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? nodule on recent film  // reassess -
 please use nipple markers
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Lung nodule questioned on ___ is not the overlying left
 nipple, but looks less distinct today than it did on ___. It could be
 an inflammatory lesion in the process of resolving. I suggest repeating PA
 lateral and shallow oblique chest radiographs in 2 weeks, and if the nodule
 has not substantially cleared evaluate patient with a chest CT scan that can
 be scheduled contingently for later the same day .
 
 Heart size is top- normal. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural
 abnormality. Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads are in
 standard placements.
