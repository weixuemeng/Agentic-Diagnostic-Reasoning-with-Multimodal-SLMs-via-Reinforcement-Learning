                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with critical aortic
 stenosis with end-stage renal disease after 2 liters of fluid.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is worsening of the left perihilar and lower lobe opacity, highly
 concerning for the asymmetric pulmonary edema or massive aspiration.  Rapid
 progression of infection is less likely although cannot be excluded.  Left
 pleural effusion is noted.  Left lower lobe opacity most likely reflects
 atelectasis.
 
 Again, given the lack of the findings back on ___ CT abdomen,
 massive aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema would be more likely
 possibility.
