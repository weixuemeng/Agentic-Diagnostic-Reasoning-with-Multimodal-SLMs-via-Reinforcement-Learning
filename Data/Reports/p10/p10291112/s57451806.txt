                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F intubated eval for cardiopulm change  // ___F intubated eval
 for cardiopulm change      ___F intubated eval for cardiopulm change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are stable.  However, there has been an increase in the layering pleural
 effusions bilaterally with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  This makes
 it somewhat difficult to assess the pulmonary vessels, which are mildly
 engorged an ill-defined, consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous
 pressure.
