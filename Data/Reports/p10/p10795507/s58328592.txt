 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a new  lingular

 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine
 with anterior osteophyte formation. Intermittent areas of dense sclerosis and
 loss of corticomedullar interface evident in multiple ribs, better assessed on
 prior CT, consistent with malignancy.
