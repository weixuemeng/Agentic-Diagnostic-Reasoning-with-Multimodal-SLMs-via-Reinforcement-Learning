 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase
 in extent of the pleural effusion on the left.  This increase is more obvious
 on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  However, there is additional
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  The size of the cardiac silhouette and the
 right lung are of unchanged appearance.
