                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously seen heterogeneous right lower lung opacities have
 essentially resolved.  Dense consolidative opacities in the left retrocardiac
 region have also markedly improved.  There is an area of reticular opacity
 projecting along the right paramediastinal upper lobe that is equivocally
 present on the prior study.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  A small left pleural effusion is decreased.  There is no
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Reticular opacity projecting over the right superior paramediastinal
 region, possibly an infectious focus.  Recommend further evaluation with an AP
 lordotic radiograph.  This finding and recommendation was discussed with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:54 p.m. via telephone on the day of the
 study.
 
 2.  Interval near-complete resolution of bibasilar opacities seen on the prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 3.  Decreased small left pleural effusion.
