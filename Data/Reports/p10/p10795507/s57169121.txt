 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion, status post thoracocentesis, evaluation
 for pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known pleural effusion
 on the left has minimally increased in extent.  After left thoracocentesis,
 there still is no evidence for a left pneumothorax.  Minimal increase in
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  Moderate cardiomegaly without overt
 pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
