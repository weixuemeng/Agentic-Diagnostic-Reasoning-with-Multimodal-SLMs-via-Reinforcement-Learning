                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small to moderate left pleural effusion, likely slightly smaller in
 size as compared to the prior study, with overlying atelectasis.  Left mid
 lung/perihilar patchy opacity of the patchy opacities in the right mid to
 lower lung are seen, raising concern for infection or less likely aspiration. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are grossly unremarkable.  Evidence of distal seen along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
 
 Left mid lung and right mid to lower lung patchy opacities are seen which
 could be due to multifocal infection or aspiration.  Correlate with history of
 malignancy.
