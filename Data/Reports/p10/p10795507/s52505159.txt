                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following left-sided thoracentesis, a left pleural effusion has
 substantially decreased in size with only a very small effusion remaining. 
 Pleural opacity posteriorly on the lateral radiograph likely corresponds to an
 area of known malignant pleural thickening on recent CT torso of ___.
 There is no visible pneumothorax.  Improved aeration in the left lower lung. 
 Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near resolution of left pleural effusion following thoracentesis,
 with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Posterior left pleural thickening
 consistent with malignant pleural disease.
