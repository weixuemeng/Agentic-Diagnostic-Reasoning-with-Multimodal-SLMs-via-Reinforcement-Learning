                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pleural thickening.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior chest radiographs, there has been interval
 progression of a left lower lobe opacification, likely due to a combination of
 pleural thickening and pleural fluid.  Evaluation for interval change from the
 prior CT is difficult given the different technique and patient positioning. 
 There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in the left lower lobe opacifications since ___,
 likely due to a combination of pleural thickening and pleural fluid.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 2:00 PM on ___ via telephone.
