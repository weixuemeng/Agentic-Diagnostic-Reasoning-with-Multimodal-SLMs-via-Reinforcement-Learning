                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, recurrent left effusion, question
 aspiration, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube are likely unchanged in position.  There is persistent left lower lobe
 airspace opacity with an associated effusion which could reflect compressive
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Overall,
 this does not appear to be significantly changed.  The right lung appears
 clear with improved aeration at the right base.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
