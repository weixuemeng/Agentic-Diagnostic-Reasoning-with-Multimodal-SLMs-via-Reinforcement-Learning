                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:20 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia and lymphoma, recurrent
 effusion, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 11:07.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:20 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patient is markedly rotated on the current examination.  Heart remains
 stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient
 rotation.  Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position.  The
 endotracheal tube likely has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The
 right pleural effusion appears somewhat decreased.  There is a layering left
 effusion with associated consolidation in the retrocardiac region, likely
 reflecting partial lower lobe collapse, although superimposed infection cannot
 be excluded.  Overall, the pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat ill-defined,
 which could reflect a component of interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
