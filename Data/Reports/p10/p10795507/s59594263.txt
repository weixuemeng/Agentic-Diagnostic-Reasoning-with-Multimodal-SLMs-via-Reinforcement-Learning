 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, tachypnea, pulmonary edema, evaluation for
 effusions or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in
 extent and severity of the bilateral pleural effusions.  Moreover, the
 parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, both on the right and in the
 retrocardiac lung areas, is constant.  The remaining lung parenchyma is
 stable, without evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities.  No
 radiographic evidence of edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly, mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
