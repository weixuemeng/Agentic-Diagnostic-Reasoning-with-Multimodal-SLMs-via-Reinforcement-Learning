                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tachycardia.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Extremely low lung volumes are seen.  There is new opacity
 at the left lung base laterally, potentially in part due to atelectasis;
 however, is incompletely characterized.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Chest wall port is again noted.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes.  Increased opacity at the left lung
 base laterally, potentially due to atelectasis; however, infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  Repeat exam with better inspiratory effort may offer additional
 detail if patient is amenable.
