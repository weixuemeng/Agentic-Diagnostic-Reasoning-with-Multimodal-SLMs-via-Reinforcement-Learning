                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain for four days.  Evaluate for
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Minimal opacification at the left lung base appears most
 consistent with atelectasis, underlying infection is less likely but cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal opacification at the left lung base likely represents
 atelectasis; however, infectious process, although less likely, not excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
