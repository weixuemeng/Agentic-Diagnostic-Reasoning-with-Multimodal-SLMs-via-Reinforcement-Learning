                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent opiate overdose, requiring mechanical
 ventilation.  Right pleural effusion or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Appearance of the right lower chest on the frontal view is consistent with
 either basal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The lateral projection today
 shows that the finding is primarily due to severe consolidation of all the
 basal segments on the right, generally a finding of atelectasis rather than
 pneumonia.  There may be a small accompanying pleural effusion commonly seen
 with basal atelectasis.  Findings do point to aspiration or retained
 secretions.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.
