                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of right chest pain
 status post diaphragmatic hernia repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 is a right lower hemithorax opacity/elevation of right hemidiaphragm which may
 represent large right-sided Morgagni hernia with overlying right base
 plate-like atelectasis as on prior study. However, per patient history, there
 is history of hernia repair.  If patient did indeed have a repair of Morgnani
 hernia, then there is density at the right lower hemithorax/elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm which could be further evaluated with CT.There is
 subsequent stable mild shift of the mediastinum to the left.  The left lung is
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Again seen is a right lower hemithorax opacity/elevation of right
