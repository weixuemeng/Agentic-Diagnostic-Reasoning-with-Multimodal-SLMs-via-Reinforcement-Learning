                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male status post ___ with posterior chest
 wall pain, question rib injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right
 mid-to-lower lung scarring/atelectasis is again seen, and to a lesser extent
 left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  There are questionable subtle, faint nodular
 opacities seen projecting over the upper lungs without significant change
 since the prior study, see interval chest CTs for further evaluation.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No displaced rib fracture is seen, however, if clinical concern for rib
 fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
 2.  Bibasilar linear atelectases/scarring.  Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
