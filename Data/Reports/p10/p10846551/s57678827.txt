                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with syncope.  Question consolidation or
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lung volumes are slightly low.  There is a
 patchy opacity in the left lung base, probably representing atelectasis,
 although early infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe, which could represent
 subsegmental atelectasis versus subtle early infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
