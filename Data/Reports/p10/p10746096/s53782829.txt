                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with persistent cough  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Mediastinal contour appears relatively unchanged.  Prominence of
 the hila bilaterally may suggest underlying lymphadenopathy.  Consolidative
 opacity in the right middle lobe and ill-defined left perihilar opacity are
 concerning for areas of infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar and right middle lobe consolidative opacities concerning for
 pneumonia.  Prominence of the hila bilaterally suggests underlying
 lymphadenopathy which may be reactive.  Followup radiographs after treatment
 are recommended to ensure resolution of these findings.
