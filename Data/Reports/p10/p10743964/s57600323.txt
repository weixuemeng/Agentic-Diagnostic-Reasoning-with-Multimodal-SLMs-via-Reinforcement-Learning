                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 AMENDMENT:  Being alerted by a specific question from the referring nurse, I
 detect an error in my report.  The sentence "pneumothorax in apical area"
 should read "NO pneumothorax in apical area".  I apologize for any temporary
 confusion this may have caused.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormalities identified, however, a mild degree of left-sided displacement of
 the heart shadow is noted most likely related to the mild degree of pectus
 excavatum as noted on the lateral view.  Thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  Pneumothorax in apical area.  Skeletal structures are
 grossly unremarkable with the exception of a mild degree of pectus excavatum. 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
