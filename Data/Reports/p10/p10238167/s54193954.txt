                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post right VATS wedge resection.  Assess
 for interval change.  Reporting lots of pain.  Technical information states
 that the patient is unable to rotate the right shoulder more for an optimal PA
 view.  Unable to raise arms for a lateral view.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest again show some post-operative
 change in the right perihilar region, not significantly different compared to
 images from four days earlier.  Small right apical pneumothorax, seen at that
 time, however, is no longer evident.  Some linear atelectasis at the right
 middle lobe abuts the left hemidiaphragm and may be symptomatic.  A small
 amount of blunting of the CP angle seen on the ___ film has also resolved. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours and bony structures with S-shaped scoliosis are
 unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval resolution in post-operative changes in the right
 hemithorax with no new or worsening findings to account for symptoms.
