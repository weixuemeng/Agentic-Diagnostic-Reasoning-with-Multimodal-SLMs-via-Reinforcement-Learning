                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right middle lobe lung mass, now status post bronchoscopy. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ and
 fluoroscopic chest radiograph images obtained the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the region of recent bronchoscopy as evidenced by the
 fluoroscopic images obtained the same day, there is a vague 6.1 x 4.3 cm
 opacification, likely represents hemorrhage, not unexpected.  In addition,
 there is an opacification in the right infrahilar space with a suggestion of
 volume loss.  This likely represents subsegmental collapse of the right middle
 lobe.  Streaky bibasilar atelectatic changes present.  There appears to be a
 small right apical pneumothorax with the superior pleural line projecting
 immediately inferior to the posterior right third rib.  Minimal blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles may represent tiny pleural effusions versus
 pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small right apical pneumothorax and pulmonary hemorrhage, not
 unexpected finding following bronchoscopy.
 
 ___ communicated these findings to Dr. ___ at 10:30 a.m.
 on ___ via telephone at the time of discovery.
