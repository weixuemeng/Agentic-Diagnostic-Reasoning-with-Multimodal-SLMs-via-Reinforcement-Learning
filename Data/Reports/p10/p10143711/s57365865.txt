                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed compared to the most recent
 study from ___, allowing for differences in technique.  There has
 been interval removal of the previously seen left PICC.  There is chronic
 vascular congestion and minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  Changes
 compatible with emphysema are seen within the upper aspects of both lungs,
 right greater than left.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous,
 not significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.  
 
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Chronic vascular congestion.
