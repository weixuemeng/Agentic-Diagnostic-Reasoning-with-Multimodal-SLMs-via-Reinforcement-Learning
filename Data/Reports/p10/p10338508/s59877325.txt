                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute onset confusion and dyspnea, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded compatible with emphysema.  There is
 increased opacity at the lateral left lung base, increased from prior, seen on
 the frontal view, not well substantiated on the lateral view.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary hila are prominent, dating
 back to ___ and may reflect enlarged pulmonary arteries based on prior
 chest CT of ___.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and minimal calcification of
 the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity at the lateral left lung base, increased from prior,
 best seen on the frontal view.  Findings could relate to overlying soft
 tissue, but consolidation due to infection is not excluded.
 2.  Unchanged prominence of the bilateral hila reflecting enlarged pulmonary
 arteries as seen on prior CT of ___.
 3.  Emphysema.
