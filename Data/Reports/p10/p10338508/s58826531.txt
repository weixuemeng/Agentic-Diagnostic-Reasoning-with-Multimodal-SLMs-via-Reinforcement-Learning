  Small to moderate right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. There is
  no new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia. However, pneumonia
  obscured by opacity at the right base cannot be completely excluded. The heart
  is not enlarged and there is no pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath, tachypnea  // eval
 for pneumonia, pneumothorax, effusion      eval for pneumonia, pneumothorax,
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these earlier study of this date, there is persistent
 opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute
 focal pneumonia, though an infectious process at the right base could not be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
