 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:

 dishiscences among several sternal wires which appear unchanged. There is
 bilateral new moderate perihilar vascular engorgement and diffuse mild
 pulmonary edema in addition to a small pleural effusion on the right. The left
 lower lung is more generally opacified, markedly increased, and probably
 including a pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggesting pulmonary edema including pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Focal opacity at the left lung base suggesting pneumonia, although
 atelectasis possible, in addition to suspected pleural effusion.
