                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, DOE, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Patient is known
 to have pulmonary fibrosis, honeycombing and subpleural fibrosis, better
 assessed on the prior CT scan.  Allowing for differences in modality, the
 overall pattern of pulmonary fibrosis appears similar.  There is no convincing
 evidence for superimposed pneumonia, though a subtle pneumonia would be
 difficult to exclude.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 stable.  The rightward deviation of the trachea is stable from prior exam,
 likely reflecting retraction from asymmetric pulmonary fibrosis in the right
 upper lung.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive pulmonary fibrosis, similar in overall pattern from
 prior exam.  No definite signs of superimposed pneumonia, though subtle
 pneumonia difficult to exclude.
