                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.  CT
 chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right upper extremity PICC terminates in the distal superior vena
 cava.
 
 Lung volumes are minimally improved.  There is an unchanged infiltrative
 pulmonary abnormality, right greater than left, consistent with the history of
 ARDS.  A more focal area of airspace consolidation seen in the right upper
 lobe is new.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe airspace opacification which may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or a developing pneumonia.
