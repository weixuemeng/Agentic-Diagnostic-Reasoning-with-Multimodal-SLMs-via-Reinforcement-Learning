 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent multifocal pneumonia, continued hypoxia, evaluation for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Extensive predominantly reticular bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 right more than left, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Indistinct
 borders of the vessels might suggest minimal fluid overload.  Lateral apical
 thickening.  Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube.  No evidence of acute
 changes.
