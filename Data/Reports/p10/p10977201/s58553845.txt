                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness and pain radiating from left scapula down left
 arm.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated.  There is slight increased opacity over a lower
 thoracic vertebral body on the lateral view, possibly corresponding to a lower
 lobe consolidation versus overlap of structures.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible lower lobe opacity best seen on the lateral view could
 be due to atelectasis.  If there is continued concern for pulmonary nodules or
 metastatic lesions, chest CT is more sensitive.
