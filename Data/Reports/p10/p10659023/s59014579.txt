 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough, sob, fevers, evaluate
 for pneumonia  // ?pneumonia      ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight asymmetry in radiodensity in lungs, left midlung slightly greater than
 right, could be due to overlying soft tissue lower small region of residual
 pneumonia.  There is also the suggestion of greater radiodensity on the
 lateral view in the middle lobe or lingula.  Overall findings are suspicious
 for small region of residual infection in the lingula, but the level of
 certainty would be improved with oblique views.  There is no pleural effusion
 or evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size normal.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  I discussed the findings by telephone with the referring
 physician ___ ___:30.
