 HISTORY:  Recent bone marrow transplant, question aspiration.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided PICC line is unchanged.  There is haziness projecting

 is no definite infiltrate.  If further delineation is desired, a lateral film
 would be helpful for more complete assessment.  The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.
