                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:40 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with AML and multifocal pneumonia.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread pulmonary opacification has progressed, particularly in the right
 upper lung, accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion.  Small
 left pleural effusion and moderate cardiomegaly are relatively unchanged. 
 Overall findings are most readily explained by pulmonary edema but concurrent
 pneumonia could be present and not appreciated.  Without a wire, the course of
 the right PIC line is difficult to address with confidence, but it appears to
 go as far as the distal SVC.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding. 
 No pneumothorax.
