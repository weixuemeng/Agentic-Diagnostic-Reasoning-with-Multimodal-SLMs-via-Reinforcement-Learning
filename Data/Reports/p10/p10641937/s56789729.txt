                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, bone marrow transplant.
 
 Compared to the study from the prior day, again seen is volume loss in both
 lower lungs with the right-sided opacity being more apparent than on the study
 from the prior day. There is increased vascular plethora with pulmonary
 vascular re-distribution and prominent hila bilaterally that worsened compared
 to the film from the prior day suggesting worsening fluid status.  An
 underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
