                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  AML, double cord stem cell transplant, immunosuppressant, biliary
 sepsis, recent hypoxia, assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral opacities have not significantly changed since the last exam. Even
 if part of it could be related to pulmonary edema, more focal areas in right
 middle and upper lobe should raise concern for superimposed pneumonia.  Right
 jugular line ends in mid SVC.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Bilateral opacities have not changed in extent.  As mentioned in earlier exam,
 part of it could be due to pulmonary edema; however, more focal areas in right
 lung should raise concern for superimposed infection.
 
 The results have been discussed with medical team.
