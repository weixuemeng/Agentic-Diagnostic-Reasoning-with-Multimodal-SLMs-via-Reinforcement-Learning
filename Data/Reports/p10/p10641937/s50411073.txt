                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING:  
 
 A left IJ line is presen --  the tip overlies the distal SVC.  Heart size is
 at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  Possible minimal atelectasis at
 both bases. No frank consolidation or gross effusion.  The extreme left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Possible slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, probably unchanged.
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.
