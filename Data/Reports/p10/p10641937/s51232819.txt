                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left central line assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen is a left-sided subclavian central
 venous catheter terminating at the mid SVC.  There is slight kinking of the
 catheter near the insertion site.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. The central pulmonary vessels are prominent, however there is no
 overt edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of a left subclavian central venous catheter
 terminating at the mid SVC.  There is slight kinking near the entry site but
 it is unclear if this segment is internal or external to the patient.
