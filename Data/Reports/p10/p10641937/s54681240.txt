                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with refractory AML, now with abdominal pain,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 8:20 a.m.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC.  There
 has been interval removal of the feeding tube.  Lungs appear relatively well
 inflated with resolution of the previously seen pulmonary edema.  There is no
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There is a deformity of the distal right clavicle, which
 may be related to a remote trauma.
