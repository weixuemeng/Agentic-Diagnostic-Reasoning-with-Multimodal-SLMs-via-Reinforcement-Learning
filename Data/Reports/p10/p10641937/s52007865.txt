 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:48 PM
   New ETT appropriately positioned, ending 4.5 cm above the level of the
  carina.  Right IJ catheter unchanged in position.  Lung volumes slightly lower
  than on the study from earlier today, causing increased accentuation of the
  left retrocardiac opacification, which represents some combination of
  atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Right lower lung heterogeneous opacities
  are likely minimal atelectasis.  No definite pleural effusions.  No
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with sepsis, intubated
 after ET tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line
 tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Since the prior examination, there is
 interval substantial progression of left retrocardiac consolidation as well as
 left lower lobe opacity.  Mild interstitial prominence is grossly unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
