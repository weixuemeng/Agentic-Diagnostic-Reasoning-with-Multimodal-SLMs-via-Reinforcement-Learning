                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening abdominal pain, history of biliary sepsis, worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  The extreme left costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.  
 
 A right IJ central line is present.  The tip is not well visualized, ?over
 distal SVC.  
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  There
 is upper zone redistribution.  There is increased retrocardiac density and
 obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  There is also patchy density at the right cardiophrenic
 region and blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No gross left effusion
 is identified; a small left effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Progressive opacification at the left base, with interval obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  
 
 2) Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region.  Differential diagnosis includes
 a pneumonic infiltrate.
