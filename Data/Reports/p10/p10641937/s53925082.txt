                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Worsening bilateral multifocal
 airspace opacities with relative sparing of the left upper lobe may reflect
 worsening multifocal pneumonia with or without coexisting edema.  Bilateral
 small pleural effusions persist.
