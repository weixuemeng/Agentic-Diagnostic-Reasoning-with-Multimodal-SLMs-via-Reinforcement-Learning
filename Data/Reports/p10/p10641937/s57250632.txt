 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Peritonitis, desaturation, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The signs indicative of pulmonary edema have increased.  Pulmonary
 edema is now moderate in severity and likely to be complicated by bilateral
 small pleural effusions.  Progressive atelectasis, notably in the retrocardiac
 lung areas.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
