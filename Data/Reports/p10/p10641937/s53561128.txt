                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML with altered mental status, to assess for intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.  The
 nasogastric tube is not well seen, but extends at least to the lower stomach
 where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
 
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
