                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biliary sepsis, to assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued low lung volumes may account for most of the prominence of
 the transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion or definite pleural effusion.
 
 Central catheter remains in place.  Mild prominence of the azygos region could
 represent some dilatation of the azygous vein as a manifestation of some
 right-sided cardiac failure.  However, this is an equivocal finding given the
 low lung volumes.
