                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ET for mental status  // evaluate ET placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside radiograph of the chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 2.7 cm from the carina. The cuff of the ET tube may be
 slightly overinflated beyond the expected borders of the trachea. Enteric tube
 courses into the stomach and beyond the field of view.  Lung volumes are very
 low. There are bilateral opacities in the right mid lung abutting the minor
 fissure and both bases. There is mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
 congestion. A small right pleural effusion may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube 2.7 cm from the carina. The cuff is slightly over inflated beyond
 the expected borders of the trachea.
 2. Low lung volumes and bilateral opacities are nonspecific and may reflect
 atelectasis or aspiration/ pneumonia.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.
