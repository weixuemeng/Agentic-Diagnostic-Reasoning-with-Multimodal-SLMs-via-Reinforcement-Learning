                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness to palpation,
 worse with inspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No large pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  No subdiaphragmatic
 free air seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
