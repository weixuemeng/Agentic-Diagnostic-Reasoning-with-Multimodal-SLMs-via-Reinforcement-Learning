                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New Dobbhoff tube, assess placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:59 a.m., the Dobbhoff has been re-positioned.  It
 now courses over the cardiac silhouette and it is difficult to confirm that it
 is appropriately positioned within the esophagus.   Again seen is a left-sided
 dual-lead pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, is at
 the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, but likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is also likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is increased retrocardiac density
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax or gross effusion identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Abnormal positioning of Dobbhoff, difficult to confirm that it lies within
 the esophagus on this view, though it could lie within a large hiatal hernia.
 
 2.  Low inspiratory volumes with prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and vascular markings.  Please see details above.
 
 Dobhoff position was discussed with ___, a nurse taking care of the patient
 on Farr ___, at 8:12 a.m. on ___, who reported that the Dobbhoff had since
 been removed and that she would convey the message to the covering house
 officers.
