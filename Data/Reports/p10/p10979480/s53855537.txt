                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever, question
 aspiration, receiving chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 right-sided central venous catheter terminating in the region of the distal
 SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Bibasilar opacities have improved in the interval
 with the right lung base clear and possible minimal residual remaining at the
 left lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild loss of height of
 a mid lower thoracic vertebral body is stable since CT of ___. 
 Posterior spinal hardware is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities with the right lung
 base clear and the left lung base with minimal residua remaining, which could
 be atelectasis versus aspiration/mild infection.
