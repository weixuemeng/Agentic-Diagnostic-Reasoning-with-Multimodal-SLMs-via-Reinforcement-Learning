                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Reflux and hiatal hernia, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is opacification above the
 elevated right hemidiaphragm, most likely representing atelectasis.  The left
 base is clear and there are no definite pleural effusions.
 
 There is again evidence of extensive posterior spinal fusion and a Port-A-Cath
 that extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.
