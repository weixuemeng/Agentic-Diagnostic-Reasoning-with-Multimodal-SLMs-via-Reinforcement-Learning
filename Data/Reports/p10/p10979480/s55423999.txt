                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Predominantly horizontal opacity in at the right base has become
 increasingly conspicuous since the prior studies in ___.  A retrocardiac
 opacity has also increased in association with decrease in lung volumes. 
 Central pulmonary vascular congestion is mild.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There are no new abnormal cardiac or mediastinal contours. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are mild.  The tip of a right chest Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Spinal fusion hardware is intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Central pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Basilar opacities likely represents a combination of central pulmonary
 vascular congestion and atelectasis.  However a focus of infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical context.
