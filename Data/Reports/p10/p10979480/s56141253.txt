                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer, presenting with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Previously noted right lower lung pneumonia and pulmonary edema have resolved.
 However, new left base consolidation is compatible with pneumonia.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive spinal fixation hardware is
 incompletely imaged.  A right subclavian infusion port catheter terminates in
 the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left base pneumonia.  Recurrent basal pneumonia in dependent
 locations is suggestive of repeated aspiration.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 3:52 p.m. on ___ at time of initial review.
