                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and recently diagnosed pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___.  CT studies
 of the chest were also available from ___ and ___, the latter
 with PET imaging.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in
 technique.  In addition to patchy right infrahilar opacity an opacity in the
 left lower lobe suggests pneumonia, better seen on the lateral view and new
 since prior studies including the PET CT from ___.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Posterior thoracolumbar fusion hardware is not
 significantly changed.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lower lobe opacities including a consolidation in the left
 lower lobe suggesting pneumonia.
