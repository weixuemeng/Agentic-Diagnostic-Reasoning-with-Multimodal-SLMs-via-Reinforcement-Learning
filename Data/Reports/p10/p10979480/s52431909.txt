                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, assess. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___; ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 Heterogeneous left lung base opacity projects over the spine on the lateral
 view.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Kerly B lines in the right lung base are are new since prior. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right PIC catheter tip projects
 over lower SVC.  Spinal fixation hardware appears intact.  Compression
 deformities of several vertebral bodies appear longstanding.  Partially imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous left lung base opacity may represent atelectasis or
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Kerly B line in the right lung base are new, could be inflammatory or new
 lympangitic spread of tumor in this patient with history of malignancy. 
 Pulmonary edema is unlikely.
