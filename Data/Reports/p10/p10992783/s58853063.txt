                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with febrile neutropenia, right sided chest pain
 and now O2 say of 90% prior CTA w/ areas of atelectasis no PE no pneumonia on
 ___  // Pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of outside scanned-in chest CT from site unknown
 dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.
 
 The heart is probably slightly enlarged.  Aorta is prominently unfolded. 
 There is platelike patchy opacity at the right lung base.  The differential
 diagnosis includes platelike atelectasis, or a pneumonic infiltrate.  The
 appearance is in keeping with findings on the outside ___ chest CT. 
 There is some increased retrocardiac density, which could reflect collapse/
 consolidation and left base.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate is identified. 
 No gross effusion.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Note is made of surgical clips surrounding the trachea, seen immediately above
 the level of the clavicular heads.
 
 Incidental note is made of degenerative change involving the AC and
 glenohumeral joints and the visualized portion of the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy focally dense opacity at the right lung base, similar findings on the
 ___ chest CT.  The radiographic appearance is compatible with
 either platelike atelectasis or a focal pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Prominently unfolded aorta.  No evidence of thoracic aortic dissection on the
 ___ chest CT.
