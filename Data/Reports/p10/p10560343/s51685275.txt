                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with some exertional dyspnea x 1 month. Cough and
 cold symptoms x 1 week. Afebrile, lungs clear.  // ? pneumonia
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, the lungs remain
 hyperexpanded but without focal areas of consolidation. Coarse reticular
 opacities at the lung bases likely corresponds to subtle basilar interstitial
 abnormalities on recent chest CT of ___. Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  No pleural effusion. Left hemidiaphragm is
 mildly elevated, with lesser degree of elevation than on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Nonspecific basilar interstitial abnormality likely corresponding to
 interstitial lung abnormalities on recent chest CT of ___.
 Consider correlation with pulmonary function testing as well as possible
 followup chest CT to assess for possible progressive interstitial lung
 disease.
