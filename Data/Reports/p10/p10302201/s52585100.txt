  Pulmonary edema and possible trace right pleural effusion.  
  
  Enlarged cardiac silhouette suggestive cardiomegaly noting that pericardial
  effusion is also possible. 
  
  Increased density in the subcarinal region raises possibility of underlying
  rounded structure and followup after treatment is suggested to further
  characterize.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  
 Increased interstitial opacities is seen in the lungs bilaterally.  There is
 no large pleural effusion noting minimal blunting of the right posterior
 costophrenic angle which may be due to trace effusion.  Slightly increased
 opacity seen on the lateral view in the subcarinal region.  Given suggestion
 of a well-defined posterior and inferior margin on the lateral view.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary edema and possible trace right pleural effusion.  
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette suggestive cardiomegaly noting that pericardial
 effusion is also possible. 
 
 Increased density in the subcarinal region raises possibility of underlying
 rounded structure and followup after treatment is suggested to further
