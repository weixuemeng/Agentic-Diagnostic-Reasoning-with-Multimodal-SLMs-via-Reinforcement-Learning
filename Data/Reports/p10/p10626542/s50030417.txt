                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a well-defined round opacity abutting the posterior aspect

 frontal view, unchanged from ___. The remaining of the left lung is clear.
 There are no other focal opacities in the left lung.  The cardiomediastinal
