                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with weakness, cough, crackles in the right
 lower lobe.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of emphysema. Compared with prior exam
 there is mild interval increase of cardiac size, with worsening of vascular
 congestion, more prominent in both lower lobes. There is also coarse
 interstitial thickening, more prominent in the left lower lobe suggestive of
 interstitial pulmonary edema. There is chronic minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle but no clear effusion.  No right-sided effusion is seen.
 There is no pneumothorax. Old healed left-sided rib fractures are
 re-demonstrated.
 
 Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders are seen, right worse than left,
 with loss of the acromiohumeral interval in the right suggestive of rotator
 cuff pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Vascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of
 slightly worsened cardiomegaly compared with ___.
 
 2.  Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders, right worse than left.
