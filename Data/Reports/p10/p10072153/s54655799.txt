                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, increasing leukocytosis.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have
 been removed.  A PICC line is present with the tip in the mid SVC.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted.  Cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 plethora is seen, consistent with failure.  Volume loss in both the right and
 left lower lobes is present, probably atelectasis, but pneumonia in this
 region is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of failure, basilar pneumonia not excluded.
