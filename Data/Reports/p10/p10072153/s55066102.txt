 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:52 PM
  Little change in comparison to the prior study from ___ with bilateral
  pleural effusions, moderate right and small left, with right basilar
  atelectasis; however, overlying pneumonia must be excluded in the proper
  clinical setting. Vascular engorgement persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening ascites, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion has minimally increased.  The resulting atelectasis at the
 left and right lung bases as well as the cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary
 edema persist.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence
 of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No new parenchymal opacity. 
 No pneumothorax.
