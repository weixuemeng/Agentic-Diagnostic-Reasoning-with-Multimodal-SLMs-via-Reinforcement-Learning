                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:17
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, question pneumonia or edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 11:46.
 
 A portal semi-upright chest film ___ at 5:17 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. 
 There continue to be diffuse bilateral parenchymal and interstitial opacities,
 which are likely not significantly changed, although there is some improvement
 in aeration.  There is likely a layering left effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.  Hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical
 spine.  No pneumothorax.
