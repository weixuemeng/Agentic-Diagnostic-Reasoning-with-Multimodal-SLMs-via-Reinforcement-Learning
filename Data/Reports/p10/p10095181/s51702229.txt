                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.
 Diffuse bilateral opacities have progressed since prior exams.  There is small
 left pleural effusion.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. 
 Heart size is top normal.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Right
 Port-A-Cath tip projects over proximal right atrium.  Surgical clips and
 biliary stent project over right upper abdomen.  Cervical fixation hardware is
 in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral opacities, most likely pulmonary edema, have
 progressed since prior studies.  However, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
