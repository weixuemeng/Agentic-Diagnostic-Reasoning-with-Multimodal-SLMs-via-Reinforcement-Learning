                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Advanced prostate cancer, with pleural
 effusions, to reevaluate and determine need for pleurX catheter  // To
 quantify pleural effusions bilaterally, thanks
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.  . 
 Bone scan ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are moderate to large layering bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Underlying parenchymal opacities
 are likely present particularly in the right lower lobe as seen on prior CT of
 the chest ___.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Areas of sclerosis in bilateral scapular, and throughout the ribs is
 compatible with known metastatic prostate cancer.  There is also known
 metastatic disease in the thoracic spine.  There is a partially imaged drain
 or catheter projecting over the left mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Layering moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left.  More accurate quantification could be performed with upright lateral
 radiograph or CT chest.
 2. Known osseous metastatic disease.
