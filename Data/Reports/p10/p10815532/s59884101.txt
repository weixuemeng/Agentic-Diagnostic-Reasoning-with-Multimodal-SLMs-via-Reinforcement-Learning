                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post mitral valve repair, evaluate prior to discharge.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternotomy wires, a mitral valve prosthesis and CABG clips are
 constant.
 
 The moderate right pneumothorax is unchanged as has been noted on multiple
 prior chest radiographs since ___.  There is no shift of the
 mediastinum to suggest tension.  Retrosternal lucency could reflect a
 loculated component of air, an acceptable finding after sternotomy.
 
 As the lung volumes have improved, the bronchovascular crowding and
 retrocardiac atelectasis have improved.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is
 similar.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
