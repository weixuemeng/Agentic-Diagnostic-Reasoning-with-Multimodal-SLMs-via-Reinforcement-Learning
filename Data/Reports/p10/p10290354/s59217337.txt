                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of left PICC is in the junction of the left subclavian and left
 brachiocephalic vein at the medial aspect of the left clavicle.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for an approximately 2 cm diameter poorly defined nodular
 opacity at the level of the third anterior right rib.  Two adjacent poorly
 defined nodular opacities are present just above and below this level as well.
 Lungs otherwise appear clear.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  2 cm poorly defined nodular opacity in the right upper lobe with
 two adjacent smaller poorly defined opacities.  Although difficult to
 definitively localize within the lungs on a single view, this finding raises
 the concern for either a primary lung malignancy or unusual infection such as
 fungal organisms or septic emboli.  
 
 As discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:36 a.m., a
 chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
