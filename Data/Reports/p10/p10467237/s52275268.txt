                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:02 P.M., ___
  
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with an L2 compression fracture.  New hypoxia.  Is
 there pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 12:52 a.m.:
 
 Early interstitial edema has progressed.  Asymmetric distribution raises the
 possibility of aspiration to the lower lobes, but findings could be due to
 cardiac decompensation alone, since there is upper lobe vascular
 redistribution and mediastinal venous engorgement.  Overall, heart size is top
 normal and there is no pleural effusion.
