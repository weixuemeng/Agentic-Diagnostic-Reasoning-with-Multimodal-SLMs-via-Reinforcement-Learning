                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple myeloma and ileus.  Evaluate for
 location of the tip of an NG tube recently placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated.  There are no new focal opacities. 
 Left retrocardial scarring versus atelectasis and right middle lobe scarring
 is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right-sided
 PICC line is unchanged in position, ending in the upper SVC versus the
 confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  The NG tube has been advanced in the
 interval and loops into the stomach with the tip likely around the pylorus. 
 Multiple punched out lytic lesions noted in both clavicles and in the scapula
 are consistent with known history of multiple myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube terminating in the stomach.  Otherwise, unchanged
 compared with prior exam.
