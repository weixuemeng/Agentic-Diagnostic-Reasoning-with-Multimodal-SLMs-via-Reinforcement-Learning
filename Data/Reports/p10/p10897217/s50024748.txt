                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple myeloma, decubitus ulcer and
 fever.  Evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT:  Lung volumes are low.  Increased bibasilar opacities, left
 greater than right, with partial obscuration of the hemidiaphragms.  There is
 new central venous congestion and mild interstitial edema, greater on the left
 than right.  Probable small left pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Diffuse lytic osseous lesions are compatible with multiple
 myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities and pulmonary edema, more severe on the left. 
 Asymmetric distribution raises concern for superimposed infection.
 2.  Lytic osseous lesions, compatible with myeloma.
