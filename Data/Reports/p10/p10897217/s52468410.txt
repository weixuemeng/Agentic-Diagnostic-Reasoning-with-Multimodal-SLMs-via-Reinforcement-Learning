 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, shortness of breath and new hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small amount of plate-like atelectasis is seen at the left base

 diffuse demineralization and small lytic lesions in the remainder of the
 osseous structures, which is consistent with the patient's known multiple
 myeloma.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsened compression fracture of T12.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or edema.
