                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of multiple myeloma with new fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, the lung volumes are lower without
 discrete atelectasis.  The low lung volumes exaggerate the heart size,
 pulmonary vasculature, and caliber of the mediastinal veins, all of which are
 probably normal.  There are no consolidations or pleural abnormalities.  The
 pathological fracture of the sternum appears more pronounced than on the prior
 radiograph, which may be a function of the low lung volumes, and should be
 evaluated clinically to assess for stability.  Multiple lytic lesions are
 again seen within the clavicles.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Pathologic fracture of the sternum appears more prominent which may be
 related to low lung volumes.  This can be assessed clinically for stability.
