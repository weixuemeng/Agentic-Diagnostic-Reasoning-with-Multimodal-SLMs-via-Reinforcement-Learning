                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ileus status post NG tube
 placement, verify position of NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  An NG tube is seen to reach below the diaphragm where
 it is curled up in the fundus of the stomach.  Moderate degree of
 gas-distended small bowel loops are noted, but there is no evidence of
 subdiaphragmatic free air.  As shown on previous chest examinations, an
 abnormal cardiac configuration is noted with a local bulge of the expected
 left ventricular contour.  As there are no signs of pulmonary congestion, this
 finding probably reflects loculated pericardial effusion which was
 demonstrated in one of the preceding echocardiographic examinations.
