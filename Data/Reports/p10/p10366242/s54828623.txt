                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Shunt series from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  Lateral chest radiograph is somewhat limited by
 suboptimal positioning of the patient's arms, preventing assessment of the
 normally clear retrosternal space.  VP shunt is more fully evaluated on the
 prior dedicated shunt series under clip ___. Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of acute aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 2.  Limited lateral radiograph, which could be repeated at no additional
 charge to the patient if warranted clinically.
