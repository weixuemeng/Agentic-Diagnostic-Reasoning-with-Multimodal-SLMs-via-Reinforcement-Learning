                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 835 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent stroke and hemiparesis with NG
 tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 835 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen, which courses below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the expected location of the stomach, although the entire
 course is not incompletely imaged.  Lungs appear well inflated with patchy
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis. There is also likely an element
 of emphysema given the paucity of lung markings at the apices.  Possible small
 left effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable and within normal limits.
