                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypotension after MVC.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest radiograph performed 1 hour prior at 07:05 and
 concurrent CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The dense right upper lobe consolidation has resolved in the interim.  There
 are bilateral diffuse hazy opacities which may be due to a combination of
 atelectasis, pulmonary edema, although in the setting of trauma, pulmonary
 contusion cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 The endotracheal tube is situated in appropriate position 3 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric tube is also visualized with the tip coursing out of the
 field of view of this exam.  Osseous structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Interval resolution of the dense right upper lobe opacity.
 
 2.  Diffuse bilateral hazy opacities may be due to a combination of
 atelectasis, pulmonary edema, although in the setting of trauma, pulmonary
 contusion cannot be excluded.
