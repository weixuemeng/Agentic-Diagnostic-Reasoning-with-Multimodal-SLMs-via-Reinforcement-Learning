                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained passenger in ___, intubated at ___, with
 LeFort III facial fx, mandibular fx, orbital fxs, b/l 1st rib fracture, and
 right frontal contusions.  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated, the endotracheal tube is now approximately 5 cm
 above the level the carina.  A nasoenteric tube is incompletely visualized,
 the tip lies below the left diaphragm.
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged.  There are diffuse bilateral hazy airspace
 opacities, slightly improved when compared to the prior study.  As previously
 this could reflect pulmonary contusion, aspiration and/or atelectasis.  No
 definite effusion seen but the left costophrenic angle is not visualized.  No
 pneumothorax.  No rib fracture seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in the bilateral hazy airspace opacities which
 again may reflect pulmonary contusions, atelectasis and/or aspiration.
