 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette remains prominent and there again is
 evidence of bilateral layering pleural effusions.  However, the hemidiaphragm
 on the right is more sharply seen, raising the possibility that this is a
 manifestation of a more erect position of the patient.  Retrocardiac
 opacification process, consistent with continued volume loss in the left lower
 lobe.  No evidence of acute pneumothorax.
