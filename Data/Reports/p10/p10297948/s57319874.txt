                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism presenting
 with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or a widened mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung volumes are
 low.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, with a very large aggregate
 of calcium in the mitral annulus, but unchanged.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  A focus of scarring is again seen in the left lung base. 
 The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
