                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Epigastric/chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally suggests mild interstitial
 edema.  There is left mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring.  Additionally,
 there is left base patchy opacity in the left base somewhat triangular opacity
 which has been present on multiple priors dating back to ___, which may
 represent scarring.  No definite new consolidation is seen, although a small
 left base consolidation will be difficult to exclude.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in inspiration technique, the
 cardiac silhouette may be slightly more enlarged than on the current study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild interstitial edema.  Left mid lung atelectasis/scarring and chronic
 scarring to left lung base with possibly mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
