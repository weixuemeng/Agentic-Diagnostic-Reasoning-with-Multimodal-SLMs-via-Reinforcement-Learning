                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with radiotherapy to the
 chest through the T-spine. Now new right-sided chest pain.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT torso from ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates dilatation of the upper mediastinum that given the
 history is most likely consistent with the known metastatic disease involving
 upper mid thoracic vertebral bodies. Overall, the width of the upper
 paramediastinal opacity is 10 cm and appears to be substantially more
 progressed than on the prior examination, most likely reflecting a combination
 of the mass and the post-radiation changes. No new abnormality within the
 right hemithorax is demonstrated within the limitations of this study
 technique.  Potential involvement of the right costovertebral junction is a
 possibility.
