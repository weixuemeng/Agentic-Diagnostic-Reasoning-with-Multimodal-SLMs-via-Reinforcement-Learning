                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate nasogastric tube placement, in a patient with CAD, CHF,
 and cerebellar stroke requiring repeated nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 repositioning or replacement of the nasogastric tube, which now terminates
 within the stomach. Lung volumes are slightly lower. Allowing for this,
 moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are unchanged. Previously noted
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged, although the left
 costophrenic angle is incompletely imaged and cannot be fully evaluated.
 Residual contrast is again seen within the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nasogastric tube terminating within the stomach.
 2. Slightly lower lung volumes with unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild
 pulmonary edema.
