                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:11 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Bright red blood per rectum.  Fever and white count.  Suspect
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small discrete areas of increased opacification in the lungs, right infrahilar
 and left base laterally are not necessarily significant, but are better
 evaluated with conventional chest radiographs to exclude pneumonia.  As
 before, the heart is severely enlarged, but today pulmonary vasculature is
 more engorged, although there is no edema or pleural effusion.
