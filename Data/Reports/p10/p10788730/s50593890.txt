                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall off bike with loss of consciousness and right shoulder chest
 wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is
 normal.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Otherwise the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is likely atelectasis
 at the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified, though the left costophrenic angle is excluded
 from the field of view.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
