                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man p/w bicycle accident +LOC w/L renal injury, L 3 4
 rib fxs, mesenteric hematoma s/p cysto, L stent placement  // Decreased O2
 sats in setting of rib fractures.     Decreased O2 sats in setting of rib

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the acute fractures of the third and
 fourth ribs on the left are again seen, but there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with small
 pleural effusion and basilar atelectatic changes are all most likely related
 to splinting.  The right lung is essentially clear.
