                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer and pleurX catheter placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, PET-CT ___, and
 reference chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded and demonstrates
 marked aortic knob calcifications, unchanged.  Opacities within the right
 hilum and right upper lobe abutting the fissure are unchanged, and compatible
 with known malignancy.  Indistinctness and engorgement of the pulmonary
 vascular markings with associated haziness in the right lung likely reflects
 lymphangitic spread of tumor, though volume overload is not excluded, with
 increasing hazy opacification in the right lung base.  Slight worsening of the
 streaky ill-defined opacity within the right lung base may also reflect right
 basilar atelectasis and/or infection.  There is hyperinflation of the left
 lung with no new focal areas of consolidation identified.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  A Pleurx catheter is seen with tip terminating at the right
 basilar hemithorax with a small right pleural effusion again noted, unchanged.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacification within the right lung base may reflect worsening
 atelectasis and/or infection with superimposed lymphangitic spread of tumor or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged, with Pleurx
 catheter in place. 
 
 3.  Re- demonstration of right hilar and right upper lobe masses compatible
 with known malignancy.
