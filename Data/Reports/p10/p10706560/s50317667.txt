                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.

 inspiration.  The increased opacification at the right base again may reflect
 worsening atelectasis, superimposed pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 superimposed lymphangitic spread of tumor.  The left effusion is somewhat more
 prominent on the previous study.
