 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Right thoracocentesis, patient with known lung masses, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no visible pneumothorax.  The right pleural effusion has decreased
 significantly post-thoracocentesis.  There is still a very mild residual
 pleural effusion.  The right lung mass is seen at the right upper lobe and
 there is a convexity of the right hilum compatible with the lymphadenopathies
 seen on the CT scan.  The left lung is unremarkable.  The mediastinal and
 cardiac contour are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no pneumothorax post-thoracocentesis.  The right pleural effusion has
 decreased significantly.
