                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weight gain, increased creatinine
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Kyphotic positioning slightly limits assessment.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 top-normal.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is present.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes, and appear relatively unchanged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Clips are noted projecting over the left neck.  The
 osseous structures are diffusely demineralized with loss of height of several
 mid and lower thoracic vertebral bodies, findings which appear relatively
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to kyphotic positioning.  Low lung volumes with probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.
