                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral basal opacities with the most confluent at the
 left base suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears moderately enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. Small lung nodules in the upper lobes seen in concurrent CT are
 below the resolution of this CXR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia, worst in the left
 lower lobe, and better delineated on the dedicated chest CTA.  Follow up in
 six weeks is recommended to ensure resolution.
