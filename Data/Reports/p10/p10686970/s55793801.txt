                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right scapula and flank pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but similar.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are relatively unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Streaky and patchy ill-defined opacities in both lung bases are new compared
 to the prior chest radiograph, and may reflect areas of infection, aspiration
 or atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion may be present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with new bibasilar airspace opacities,
 nonspecific, possibly reflecting atelectasis though aspiration or infection
 cannot be excluded.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
