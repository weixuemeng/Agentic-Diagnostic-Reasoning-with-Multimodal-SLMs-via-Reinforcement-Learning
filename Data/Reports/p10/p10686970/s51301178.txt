                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.  Bibasilar
 heterogeneous opacities are accompanied by bronchial wall thickening and
 involve the right lower lobe to a greater extent than the left lower lobe. 
 Similar but less extensive opacities were seen in the right lower lobe on the
 previous study, and more extensive abnormalities were present in the left
 lower lobe at that time.  Observed findings most likely represent clinically
 suspected recurrent aspiration or aspiration pneumonia in this patient with a
 history of aspiration on previous video swallow study.  Followup radiographs
 would be helpful to document resolution.
