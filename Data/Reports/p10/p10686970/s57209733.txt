                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tightness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The left lung
 base is incompletely imaged.  Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis. 
 Right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis, but may also represent developing
 or resolving infection or aspiration.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal
 limits.  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged allowing for
 patient rotation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis, but aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.
