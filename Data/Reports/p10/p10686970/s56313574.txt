                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and wheezing.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.  A
 CT chest from ___ as well as a PA and lateral chest radiograph
 from ___ were also assessed for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with recent radiographs from ___, there has been
 progressive worsening of the ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung,
 without obscuration of the right heart border.  Bilateral diffuse interstitial
 opacities are unchanged from ___, but new from ___,
 suggesting a background of diffuse interstitial edema.  A small right-sided
 pleural effusion is not significantly changed from prior.  There is mild
 pleural thickening seen in the periphery of the right lung base.  There is no
 left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Streaky
 opacities in the left lung base are compatible with atelectasis.  Even though
 an AP view is not ideal for assessment of heart size, there appears to be
 moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe pneumonia with underlying interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
