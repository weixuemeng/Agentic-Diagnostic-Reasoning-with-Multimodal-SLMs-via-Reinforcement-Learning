                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. Right shoulder
 radiographs ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to patient's rotation and low lung
 volumes.  The heart size is difficult to assess given the degree of rotation
 but may be mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Assessment of the
 mediastinal and hilar contours is limited.  There are low lung volumes with
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are present.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Widened right AC joint is chronic,
 unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar
 airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes,
 but infection or aspiration are not excluded.
