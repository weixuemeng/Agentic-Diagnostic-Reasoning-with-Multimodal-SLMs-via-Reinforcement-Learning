                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: HIV positive patient with cough and dehydration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There is patchy opacity at both bases, similar to prior films. This most
 likely represents bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring.  Early
 infiltrates are considered less likely, though remain in the differential. 
 Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphgram is noted, similar or slightly
 improved compared with ___.
 
 Lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without CHF. focal consolidaiton, effusion
 or ptx.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits,
 allowing for changes in the right cardiophrenic region.
