                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated in respiratory distress  // Evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea.  A
 feeding tube extends into the stomach.  The tip of the left internal jugular
 central venous catheter projects over the mid SVC.
 
 The lungs are markedly hyperexpanded.  There are persisting but decreased left
 lower lung zone patchy opacities.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles are
 noted which may reflect small bilateral pleural effusions or pleural
 thickening.  No pneumothorax identified.  The size the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in extent of the patchy opacities in the left lower lung
 zone.
 
 New blunting of both costophrenic angles may reflect small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
