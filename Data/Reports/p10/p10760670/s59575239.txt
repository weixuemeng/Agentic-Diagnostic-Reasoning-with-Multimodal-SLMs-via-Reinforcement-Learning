                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia, question resolving pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and numerous prior radiographs and CTs dating
 back to ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam the recently developed extensive
 right-sided parenchymal opacities have almost completely resolved with minimal
 residual opacity in the right middle lobe, seen best on the lateral
 radiograph.  However, a wedge-shaped opacity noted in the posterior segment of
 right upper lobe has slightly increased in size and density since ___ and is
 associated with elevation of the minor fissure. Questionable new nodules are
 also seen in the left lower lobe.  Heart size and hilar contours are stable. 
 There are no pleural effusions. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Markedly improved right-sided pneumonia with only minimal residual disease.
 2) Slow growth of the right upper lobe opacity with associated elevation of
 adjacent right minor fissue. Given it's slow growth over time and appearance
 on the chest CT from ___, this is concerning for a slow growing, low-grade
 lung adenocaricinoma. Apparently left lower lobe nodular opacities are
 nonspecific but could also be due to a similar process.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ via phone at 11:20 AM via
 telephone ___ minutes after discovery of the findings by ___.
