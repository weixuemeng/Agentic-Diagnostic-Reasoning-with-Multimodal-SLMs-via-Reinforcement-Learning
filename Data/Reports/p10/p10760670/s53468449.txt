                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with non-productive cough and shortness of
 breath found to have pneumonia and volume overload, now requiring assessment
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a decrease in the
 bilateral reticular interstitial markings of the lungs.  There has also been
 interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  These findings suggest a
 resolving pulmonary edema.  There has also been interval increase in the
 density of the previously seen right hilar, right lower zone, and right upper
 zone opacities.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving pulmonary edema.  Increasing density of right lung
 opacities suggest progressing pneumonia.
