                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory distress and pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right perihilar consolidation is
 less conspicuous than before.  This is due to difference in positioning of the
 patient and re-distribution of the moderate right pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis.  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonic
 consolidations are unchanged.  Right upper lobe wedge-shape opacity is more
 chronic.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 Mild interstitial edema has improved.
