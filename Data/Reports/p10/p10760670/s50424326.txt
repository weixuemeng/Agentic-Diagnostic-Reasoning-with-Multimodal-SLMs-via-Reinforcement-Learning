                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  shortness of breath/cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous. Hilar
 contours are unchanged. Focal consolidative opacity in the right upper
 lobewith associated elevation of the right minor fissure is relatively
 unchanged from the most recent prior radiograph, but slightly increased in
 size compared to the ___ chest CT. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 Lungs are hyperinflated suggesting COPD. New patchy opacity within the right
 lung base could reflect an area of infection. Left lung is clear. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New patchy right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia.
 2. Chronic right upper lobe focal area of consolidation, minimally changed
 from prior radiograph from ___ but slightly increased in size from chest CT
 from ___, and potentially may reflect a low-grade adenocarcinoma. A dedicated
 chest CT is recommended for further assessment if clinically indicated.
