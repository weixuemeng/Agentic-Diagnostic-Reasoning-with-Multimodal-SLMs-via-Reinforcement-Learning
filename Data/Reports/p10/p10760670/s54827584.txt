                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and dyspnea.  Rule out
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart
 size appears normal.  Pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct and prominent
 in the upper lobes, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  Peripheral wedge
 shaped right upper lobe opacity is similar to prior.  Right hilar and middle
 lobe patchy consolidative opacities are new.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  No pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and new
 right hilar and middle lobe consolidative opacities, suggestive of pneumonia. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended.
