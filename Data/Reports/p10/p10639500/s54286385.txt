 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is substantial prominence
 of the cardiac silhouette, accentuated by the extreme lordotic position of the
 patient and AP portable technique.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  This discordance raises the possibility of underlying
 cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion.
 No acute focal pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacification suggests volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and possible pleural effusion.
