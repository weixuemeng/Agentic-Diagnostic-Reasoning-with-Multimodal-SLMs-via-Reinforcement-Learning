                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVAD- CT d/c'd  // evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn with the introducer
 tip terminating in the right internal jugular vein.  The left transvenous
 pectoral pacer defibrillator lead terminates in the right ventricle.  The
 right-sided PICC is seen as far as the mid SVC.  The LVAD is again seen
 projecting over the apex of the heart.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The heart is severely enlarged.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged compared to multiple prior radiographs. There is
 persistent mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity and obscured but likely
 combination of atelectasis, pleural effusion, and edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Opacity at the left lung base likely combination of atelectasis, pleural
 effusion, and pulmonary edema.
