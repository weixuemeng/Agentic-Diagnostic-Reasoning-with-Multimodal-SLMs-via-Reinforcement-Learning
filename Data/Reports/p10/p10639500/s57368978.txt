 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:26 PM
  Swan-Ganz catheter extends into the distal right main, and probably the
  proximal right lower lobar pulmonary artery.  Cardiac pacer leads are
  re-identified and unchanged configuration.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
  Central prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely reflects pulmonary
  vascular congestion.  There is no over pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity
  is unchanged, likely atelectasis however superimposed infection is difficult
  to exclude by radiograph.  No pneumothorax.  Difficult to exclude a small left
  pleural effusion.
  
  Swan-Ganz catheter position was discussed with CCU ___ ___ M.D. by
  ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:22 PM, 5 minutes
  after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with swan placement  // swan placement      swan
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 New right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the distal right descending
 pulmonary artery.  Clinical correlation advised for appropriateness of this
 placement.No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Lungs are grossly clear.  No pulmonary edema
 or pleural effusion.  Indwelling left trans subclavian right ventricular pacer
 defibrillator lead unchanged in position.  Left pectoral generator and
 proximal course of the lead are not fully imaged.
