                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mildly low lung volumes with
 exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing
 for this, heart size is normal.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild interstitial edema. Mild linear
 atelectasis is noted at the left lung base.  Overlying motion artifact on
 lateral view limits its utility.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial edema.
