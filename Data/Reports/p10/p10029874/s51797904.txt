                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ male w subacute L parietal stroke in setting of carotid
 stenosis now s/p L CEA  // Eval source of poor oxygenation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. 
 Central vascular congestion likely reflects volume overload.  Bibasilar
 opacities, slightly asymmetric in left lower lobe can be asymmetric
 atelectasis or left lower lobe early consolidation.  No substantial effusions.
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary congestion.
 
 Bibasilar opacities, slightly worse in left lower lobe can be asymmetric
 atelectasis with low lung volumes or early consolidation.
