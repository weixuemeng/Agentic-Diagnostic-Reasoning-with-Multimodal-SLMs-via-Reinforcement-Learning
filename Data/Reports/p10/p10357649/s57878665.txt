 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Outside hospital, recurrent seizures.  Evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.  There are minimally
 increased lung volumes, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or
 increased respiratory pressure.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  No
 pneumothorax.
