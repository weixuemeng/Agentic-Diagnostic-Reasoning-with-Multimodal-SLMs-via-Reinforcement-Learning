                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Preoperative assessment, small bowel obstruction due to inguinal
 hernia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An orogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal streaky opacity within the right lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Excreted contrast material is seen within the
 collecting systems bilaterally from recent CT exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
