 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette and the appearance of the hilar
 structures are constant.  No pleural effusions.  No acute changes such as
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  However, reduction in lung density at both lung
 apices might reflect apical pulmonary emphysema.
