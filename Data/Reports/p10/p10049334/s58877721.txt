 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous moderate pulmonary edema has improved, moderate bilateral pleural

 obscure the right heart border.  Opacification at the lung bases is probably a
 combination of atelectasis, dependent edema overlying pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  .
