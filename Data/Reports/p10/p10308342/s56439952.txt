                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bronchoscopy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.9 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A left subclavian
 central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  A right IJ catheter, likely
 dual lumen, is present, tip over mid SVC.  Note is again made of patient's
 thoracic aortic stent and AVR and MVR prosthetic valves.  Multiple sternotomy
 wires and additional mediastinal clips present.  
 
 Again seen are prominent diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs,
 overall similar to the film obtained earlier the same day at 9:32 a.m.  There
 is pleural fluid tracking about the right lung, most pronounced along mid
 right lateral chest wall -- this appears increased compared with earlier the
 same day, but is similar compared to ___. No left-sided effusion is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse alveolar opacities and right pleural fluid, similar to the previous
 film (detailed above).   Radiographically, the differential diagnosis could
 include pneumonic infiltrates, ARDS, or CHF.  However, in the absence of a
 left pleural effusion, CHF is considered less likely.
