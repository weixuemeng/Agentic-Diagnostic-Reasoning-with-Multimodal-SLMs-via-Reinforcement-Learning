                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation, check tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, an ET tube has been placed. The tip lies
 in satisfactory position, approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  
 
 There is an interrupted circular structure superimposed over lower
 mediastinum, which is new compared with preoperative radiographs dated
 ___, and does not have the appearance of a typical sternal wire.  This is
 separate from the radiopaque valve that projects to the left of the
 mediastinum.  Clinical correlation regarding this structure is requested.
