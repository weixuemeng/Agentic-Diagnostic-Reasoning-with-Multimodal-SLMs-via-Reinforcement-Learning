                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endovascular aortic graft, multiple intact
 sternal wires, and right IJ central venous catheter are unchanged in position.
 There has been interval mild retraction of a left subclavian catheter, with
 the tip terminating at the upper SVC.  A right basilar thoracostomy tube is
 unchanged in position.  There has been worsening diffuse interstitial
 pulmonary edema and central vascular congestion.  Cardiomegaly is
 re-demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate left lower lobe
 atelectasis is also worsened.  A small left pleural effusion is also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion, worsening left basilar atelectasis,
 and worsening mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
