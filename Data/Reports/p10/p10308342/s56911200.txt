                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post aortic dissection with right upper extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  An aortic stent graft begins along the arch of the aorta as before.
 The patient is status post sternotomy and replacement of both the mitral and
 tricuspid valves.  The configuration of the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours is stable.  A left-sided PICC line has been removed.  There is a
 somewhat increased patchy opacification of the left lower lung, probably in
 the left lower lobe, including a small pleural effusion.  Increasing
 multifocal opacities in the right lung suggest atelectasis or scarring. 
 Findings suggest mild vascular asymmetry with interstitial prominence and
 peribronchial cuffing, somewhat more prominent on the right than the left. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Slight increase in
 patchy left lower lobe opacification suggesting a small amount of pleural
 fluid and atelectasis.
