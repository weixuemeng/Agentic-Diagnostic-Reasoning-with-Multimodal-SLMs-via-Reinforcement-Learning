 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The carina is not well defined.  However, the ET tube tip lies approximately
 4.1 to 4.9 cm above the carina, at the upper edge of the medial clavicular
 heads. An NG tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm off film.  Right
 IJ and left subclavian central lines are unchanged.  Again noted are
 sternotomy wires, mitral and tricuspid prosthetic valves, and a thoracic
 aortic stent.  There is probable background COPD.  There is marked
 cardiomegaly.  There is extensive opacification both lungs, which is grossly
 unchanged compared with the earlier film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
