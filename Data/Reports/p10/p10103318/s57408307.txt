                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before.
 
 Moderate left pneumothorax is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged and midline.  Surgical chain sutures are present in the right apex.
 Blunting of the cardiophrenic angles on the right could be due to small
 pleural effusion, pleural thickening, or findings post pleurodesis.  Right
 lower opacity secondary to pleurodesis, is also unchanged.  There are no new
 lung abnormalities.
