                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILMS, ___ AT 13:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, status post left VATS with talc
 pleurodesis, chest tubes x2; question pneumothorax, question pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:57.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 13:34, are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Two left-sided chest tubes remain in place, one of which terminates in the
 apex and the other of which extends over the apex and down the medial border
 into the left costophrenic angle.  There is some soft tissue containing
 loculated air at the left apex, but this appearance is unchanged from
 ___ and may reflect a combination of postoperative changes and/or a
 loculated pneumothorax.  Continued followup imaging would be advised.  A small
 amount of residual subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the lower lateral left
 chest wall.  No focal airspace consolidation or pleural effusions are seen. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Interval decrease in
 the amount of gas within the stomach.  Surgical chain sutures are again seen
 at both apices.  Right lateral pleural thickening is stable and may be result
 of talc pleurodesis, pleural thickening, less likely effusion.
