                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pneumothorax has nearly resolved, with only a very small
 residual air collection and fluid at the extreme left lung apex.  Bilateral
 upper lobe volume loss is consistent with previous bleb and/or bulla
 resections.  Smoothly marginated pleural opacities along the lateral lower
 chest bilaterally may reflect small effusions.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits and without change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near resolution of left pneumothorax.  Very small residual left
 apical gas collection.
