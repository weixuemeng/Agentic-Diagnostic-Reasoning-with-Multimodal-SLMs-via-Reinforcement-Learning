 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS, status post blebectomy, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:08.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the two left-sided chest
 tubes have been removed.  There is a remnant left pneumothorax, best seen at
 the level of the apex and the lateral chest wall.  The diameter of the
 pneumothorax is approximately 5 mm.  There is no evidence of tension.  Clips
 at the apex of the right lung.  Minimal air collections in the left lateral
 soft tissues.  Postoperative very subtle opacities at the left lung base but
 no evidence of acute change.
