                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with newly diagnosed cirrhosis, now w
 increasing leukocytosis  // evidence of PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy opacity at the right base has increased, concerning for progressive
 pneumonic infiltrate.  No air bronchograms are identified and there is
 probably some associated volume loss.  Possible minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, without gross effusion.
 
 Again seen is some patchy opacity at the left base, overall similar in degree
 to the prior study.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without other
 evidence of CHF.  No focal opacities are seen in the upper or mid zones in
 either lung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar.  The pulmonary hila
 are again noted to be slightly prominent.
 
 Enteric type tube present, with short radiopaque tip lying in the region of
 the GE junction.  The previously seen Dobhoff tube is no longer visualized. 
 Dual-lumen right-sided catheter, with tips overlying the distal SVC and
 cavoatrial junction, appears to be new/exchanged compared with the prior
 study.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Progressive opacity at the right base is concerning for a pneumonic
 infiltrate.
 2. Patchy opacity at the left base is not significantly changed.  The
 differential diagnosis includes atelectasis or possibly an early pneumonic
 infiltrate.
