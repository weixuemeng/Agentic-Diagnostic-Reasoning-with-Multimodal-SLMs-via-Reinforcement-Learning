                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again, the patient is kyphotic.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally are again seen, likely due to chronic lung disease.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity is again
 seen most likely atelectasis/scarring.  Right lung base opacity may also be
 due to atelectasis in underlying consolidation or infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.  There are trace pleural effusions.  The aorta remains tortuous.
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
