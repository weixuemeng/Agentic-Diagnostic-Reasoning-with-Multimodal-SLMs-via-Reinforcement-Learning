                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with unwitnessed fall, known T11 compression
 fracture.  Evaluate for evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT performed approximately half an hour prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes, accounting for some bronchovascular
 crowding.  Increased interstitial markings are seen but no focal opacities. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left, with associated
 atelectasis are better assessed in prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions with concurrent bibasilar atelectases, right
 worse than left.
 2.  Increased interstitial and bronchovascular markings might represent fluid
 overload/interstitial edema.
