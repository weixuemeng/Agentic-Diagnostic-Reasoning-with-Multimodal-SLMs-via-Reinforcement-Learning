                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS, evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is moderately limited by significant patient rotation.  Increased
 airspace opacity over the right upper lung may be related to superimposition
 of structures related to rotation or early consolidation.  Opacity of the left
 lung base may represent a small effusion with associated atelectasis.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Thoracic compression fractures are
 incompletely assess, likely similar to prior studies.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is distorted due to patient rotation but likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderately limited study due to patient rotation.
 2. POSSIBLE AIRSPACE ABNORMALITY in the right upper lung may be artifactual or
 an early consolidation.  SUGGEST REPEAT FRONTAL VIEW, CAREFULLY POSITIONED.
 3. Possible small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  REPEAT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH IF THERE IS PERSISTENT
 CLINICAL CONCERN FOR RIGHT UPPER LOBE PNEUMONIA.
