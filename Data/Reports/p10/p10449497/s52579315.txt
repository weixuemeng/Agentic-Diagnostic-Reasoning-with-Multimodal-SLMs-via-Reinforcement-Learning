                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with advanced dementia and worsening
 shortness of breath.  Study requested for evaluation of volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to patient's positioning. The heart is
 enlarged.  Increased density at the right lung base is consistent with a
 pleural effusion. There is likely persistent left base atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion, however limited evaluation due to patient
 positioning.  For a more thorough evaluation, repeat examination is
 recommended in a more symmetric position.
