                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough after choking on breakfast, assess for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are markedly distorted due to the patient's extreme
 kyphosis.  Increased interstitial markings likely reflect underlying chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Bibasilar atelectasis is presumed without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart is top normal in size
 with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and tortuous aorta. Multiple thoracic
 compression deformities are noted, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with multiple thoracic spine
 vertebral body compression fractures, please correlate with clinical exam to
 determine acuity.
