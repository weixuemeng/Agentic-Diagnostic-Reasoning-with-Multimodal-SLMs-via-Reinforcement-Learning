                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with unwitnessed fall this AM  // eval for
 intracranial hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited by patient position. The lung volumes are low, with
 bronchovascular crowding which limits assessment for cardiovascular status of
 the patient. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. As on prior studies
 bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely reflect combination of
 small pleural effusions and atelectasis. Mid thoracic compression deformities
 are grossly similar to ___ but incompletely evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema.
 2. Small pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis
