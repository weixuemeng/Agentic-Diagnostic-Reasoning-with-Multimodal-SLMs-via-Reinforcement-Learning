                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from outside hospital performed earlier
 today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer with Port-A-Cath, now intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was provided.  ETT tip
 resides approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube courses into the
 left upper abdomen.  The Port-A-Cath is unchanged with tip in the region of
 the mid SVC.  There is volume loss in the left lung with evidence of prior
 left upper lobectomy with clips in the left mid to upper lung noted.  Scarring
 in the right upper lung is present.  There is no definite evidence for
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony deformities in the left upper
 rib cage are unchanged, reflective of prior surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned ET and NG tubes.  Post-surgical changes
 in the left upper lung.
