                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  No displaced rib fractures. Although no fracture or other bone
 abnormality is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not appropriate for
 detection or characterization of chest cage lesions. Any focal findings should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
