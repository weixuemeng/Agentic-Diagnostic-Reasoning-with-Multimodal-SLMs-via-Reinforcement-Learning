                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A double lumen left-sided dialysis catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction. The left costophrenic angle remains blunted, likely secondary to
 trace pleural effusion versus chronic pleural thickening. There is no lobar
 opacity, right pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Moderate
 cardiomegaly is chronic and slightly less prominent than on the prior
 examination. The aortic arch is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Slight interval decrease in now moderate
 cardiomegaly.
