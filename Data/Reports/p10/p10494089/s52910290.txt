                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion on MRI  // ?size     
 ?size
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for the AP portable
 technique, there probably is little overall change in the degree of
 cardiomegaly. No definite vascular congestion.  This raises the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Central catheter remains in place.
 In the absence of a lateral view, it is extremely difficult to assess for
 pleural effusion.
