                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cellulitis and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lumen
 left-sided likely dialysis catheter is seen terminating in the low SVC.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is persistent blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent cardiomegaly.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 may be due to trace pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.
