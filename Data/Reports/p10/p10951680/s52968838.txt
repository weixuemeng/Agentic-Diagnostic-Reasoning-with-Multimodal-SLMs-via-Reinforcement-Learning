                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain x 2 months.  // ?pleural effusion
 ?pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in
 size.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
 The calcification projected just below the right hemidiaphragm could well
 represent a liver lesion, though and a process at the very base of the lung
 cannot be definitely excluded.  In either event, lack of change in more than ___
 years indicates that this represents a benign process.
