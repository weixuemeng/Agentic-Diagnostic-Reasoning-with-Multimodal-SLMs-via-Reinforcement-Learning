                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ h/o crohn's, afib s/p ablation admitted for
 SBO being treated for CAP, pulm edema with worsening hypoxia  // eval for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, pulmonary edema has decreased in
 severity and bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size.  There
 remains more confluent opacification at the lung bases, which could be due to
 dependent edema or a secondary process such as aspiration pneumonia.
