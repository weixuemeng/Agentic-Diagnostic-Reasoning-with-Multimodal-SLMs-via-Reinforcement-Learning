                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  CHF, fatigue, and nausea, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Hila are  prominent, but this likely reflects vascular
 shadows, and no good evidence of lymphadenopathy is seen.  The lungs are
 grossly clear.  There is probably a pectus carinatum deformity identified.
 There is no significant  interval change from before.
 
 CONCLUSION
 
 No definite acute findings
