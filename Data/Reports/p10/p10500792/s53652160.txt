                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of pleural and pericardial effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with convexity at the right cardiophrenic angle compatible with
 known lymph nodes, unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Moderate to large
 left and small right pleural effusions have increased in size compared to the
 previous exam.  Left basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Multiple nodules are
 demonstrated throughout the right lung, the largest within the right lower
 lobe measures 1.9 cm and is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large left and small right pleural effusions, increased in size
 compared to the previous exam.  Left basilar opacification could reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Multiple right
 lung pulmonary nodules are unchanged.
