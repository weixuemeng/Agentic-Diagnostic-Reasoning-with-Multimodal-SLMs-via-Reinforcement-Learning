                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis and cough.  Evaluation of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  2.0 cm nodular density in the right
 mid lung corresponds to a right lower lobe nodule on outside chest CT, likely
 represents a metastasis as there are multiple other nodules on this study. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid lung nodular density corresponding to one of multiple
 nodules on outside CT, suspicious for metastasis.
