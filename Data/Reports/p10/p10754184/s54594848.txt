                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with congestive heart failure, referred for
 evaluation of possible amiodarone toxicity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph, ___ chest CT, and ___ chest CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 A left pectoral dual-lead pacer with trans-subclavian lead extending to the
 right atrium and right ventricle is in unchanged position.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Hyperexpansion suggests underlying chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  New from prior study, there are multifocal
 lower and middle lobe parenchymal opacities.  Given the provided history and
 the apparent lack of infectious symptoms, these could represent amiodarone
 toxicity.  This suggestion is supported by the increased density of the liver
 from ___ to ___.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema to
 suggest congestive failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New multifocal parenchymal opacities in the lower and middle
 lobes bilaterally, which given concurrent increased hepatic density from
 ___ to ___, could represent amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. 
 Differential would includes infectious processes in the proper clinical
 setting or organizing pneumonia.  CT could be considered for further
 evaluation.
 
 This was discussed with Dr ___ at noon by Dr ___ on ___ via
 phone.
