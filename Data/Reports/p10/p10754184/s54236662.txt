                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with probable amiodarone lung toxicity. 
 Follow up after cessation of amiodarone in late ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS:  Lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with chronic
 lung disease. Right basilar linear opacities are much less prominent on the
 current exam.  There is no new opacity or consolidation elsewhere.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is unchanged.  Two leads
 follow a normal course from the left-sided battery pack terminating in the
 expected region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is tortuosity
 of the descending aorta, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  Hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in right basilar opacities compared to ___.
