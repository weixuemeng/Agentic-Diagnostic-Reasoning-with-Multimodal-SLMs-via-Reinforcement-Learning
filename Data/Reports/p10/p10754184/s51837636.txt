                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Probable amiodarone-induced lung toxicity, now off the drug since
 ___, assess for improvement since the prior study.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:Dual-lead pacer is seen with leads in the right atrium and ventricle
 as before.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Hyperinflation is
 again seen compatible with preexisting chronic pulmonary disease.  
 
 Right middle and lower lobe opacities are redemonstrated without new lesions.
 There is a slight change in morphology with increased lucency of one of the
 more medial opacities. They are overall unchanged in distribution and as a
 whole slightly decreased in size.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right basal nodules as a whole minimally decreased since the prior
 study. Differential for these lesions includes amiodarone toxicity and
 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. 
 
 While chest radiographs are likely suitable for monitoring for change over
 time, a baseline CT examination can be obtained to allow for better
 characterization.
