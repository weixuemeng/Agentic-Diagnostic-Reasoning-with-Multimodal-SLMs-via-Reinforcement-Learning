                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing dyspnea following chest drain removal on ___.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax and effusion.  The patient has a history of
 metastatic esophageal cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Series of radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 from ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the
 right-sided chest tube has been removed and there is now a new moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion with superimposed collapse of the right middle
 lobe seen as far back as ___ on the CT.  There are heterogeneous opacities
 in the bilateral lower lobes, obscuring the diaphragmatic contours.  A
 loculated left pleural effusion is minimally increased.  Widening of the right
 hilar contour is consistent with the patient's known lymphadenopathy.  No
 pneumothorax is evident on this study.  The previous mild interstitial edema
 has resolved.  A left chest wall Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New moderate right pleural effusion since removal of the chest tube as
 well as minimal increase in the left-sided loculated pleural effusion.
 2.  Bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacity is concerning for pneumonia,
 possibly aspiration etiology given location.
 3.  Stable right hilar lymphadenopathy and right middle lobe collapse.
