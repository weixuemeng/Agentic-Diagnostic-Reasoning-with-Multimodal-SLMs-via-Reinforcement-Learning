                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status while on chemotherapy, evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Bibasilar hazy opacities likely represent
 chronic changes with atelectasis, although a mild component of mild pulmonary
 edema is not excluded.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  A left
 side Mediport catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  The lung volumes are increased , consistent with chronic obstructive
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar hazy opacities likely represent chronic changes and
 atelectasis, although given the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions,
 mild pulmonary edema is not excluded.
