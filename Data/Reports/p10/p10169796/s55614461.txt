                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a reference CT
 abdomen and pelvis performed earlier today from an outside hospital.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Question pneumonia in the lung bases on today's CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 basilar opacity corresponds to a subtle opacity on today's CT, possibly
 representing atelectasis or a very early pneumonia.  Otherwise lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  Residual contrast is noted in bowel
 loops in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the left lung base may represent atelectasis or
 a very early pneumonia.
