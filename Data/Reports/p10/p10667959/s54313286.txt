 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of pneumonia.  Continued shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left
 perihilar opacity has completely resolved.  On today's image, neither on the
 frontal nor the lateral view, is there any parenchymal abnormality.
 
 The lateral radiograph shows a minimal intrafissural component of pleural
 fluid.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left lung bases.  No pulmonary edema.
