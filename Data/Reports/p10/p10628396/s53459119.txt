                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post surgery with an episode of vomiting with LMA in place. 
 Evaluate for possible aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are noted to be decreased.  The ET tube tip terminates 3 cm
 above the carina.  Focal areas of increased density are seen within the right
 upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe, and may be secondary to
 atelectasis versus aspiration.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, left
 greater than right.  There is stable, moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  The
 mediastinum is somewhat widened, which may be secondary to both the projection
 and the patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral opacities which may represent atelectasis versus aspiration. 
 Recommend attention on follow up.
 
 2. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.
