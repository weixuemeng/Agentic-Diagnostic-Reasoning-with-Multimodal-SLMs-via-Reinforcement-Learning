 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is a
 new small left pleural effusion with increased opacity at the left base. 
 There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.  Additionally, vague
 increased density at both upper lobes is new. There is interval placement of
 an NG tube with tip terminating in the stomach pointing cephalad.  Surgical
 clips are seen in the right upper quadrant as well as an IVC filter. Retained

 IMPRESSION:

 2.  New small left pleural effusion with atelectasis. Bilateral new apical
 hazy densities. Attention to these areas is recommended on follow up
 radiographs. Pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
