 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of Hodgkin's, pericarditis, chronic cough, evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No acute lung changes, notably no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  Bilateral paramediastinal fibrosis, presumably caused by
 radiation therapy after Hodgkin's disease.
 
 Clips projecting over the upper abdomen.  Normal hilar contours.
