                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  History of splenectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Paramedian interstitial changes about the upper mediastinum
 with medial apical subpleural thickening appear unchanged.  What is new is a
 confluent consolidation projecting over the lateral left lower lobe,
 compatible with pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Surgical clips project along the upper abdomen.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left lower lobe suggesting pneumonia.
