                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated, assess for ETT and OGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 09:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is low lying,
 with tip terminating approximately 2.5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 has been placed, coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and
 tip off the inferior borders of the film.  There is continued re-
 demonstration of moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, moderate in degree
 and slightly worse in the interval.  Retrocardiac opacity persists, and again
 may reflect atelectasis.  A trace left pleural effusion may be present.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lying endotracheal tube with tip terminate approximately 2.5 cm from
 the carina.  Recommend slight withdrawal by approximately 1-2 cm.
 2.  Enteric tube in standard position.
 3.  Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  Probable trace left pleural effusion.
 Retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis.
