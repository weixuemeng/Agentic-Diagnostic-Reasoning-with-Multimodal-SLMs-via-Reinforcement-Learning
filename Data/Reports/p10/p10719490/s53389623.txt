                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated BNP.  Question effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears borderline enlarged in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are probably within normal limits for technique.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  The bones are
 probably demineralized.  Each acromiohumeral interval is effaced, suggesting
 rotator cuff tears, with severe degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Borderline cardiomegaly.
