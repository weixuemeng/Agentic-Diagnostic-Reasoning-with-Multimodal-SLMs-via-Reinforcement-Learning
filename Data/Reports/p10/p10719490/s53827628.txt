                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with possible sepsis.  Evaluate for an acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval worsening of moderate cardiomegaly.  New hilar fullness bilaterally
 with engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes
 and supine AP technique.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Marked
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.  Probable
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
