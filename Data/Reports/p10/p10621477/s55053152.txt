                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___'s disease with syncope, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a focal
 eventration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely accounting for the subtle
 retrocardiac opacity.  A subtle nodular opacity at the right lung base which
 could represent a nipple shadow, though this is indeterminate.  No definite
 signs of pneumonia or CHF.  The heart appears top normal in size.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Bony structures appear intact with degenerative anterior
 spurring in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacity at the right lung base for which
 non-emergent CT may be performed to further assess.
