                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST SINGLE VIEW:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and low oxygen saturation and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There is increased parenchymal
 opacity in the left lung compared to the right.  Subtle right basilar opacity
 may also be present, although may be due to overlying soft tissues.  Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size for technique and positioning.  Retrocardiac
 opacity seen medially could represent hiatal hernia, but is not well assessed.
 There is no large effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left mid-to-lower lung opacities and subtle right basilar opacity
 most suspicious for pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Recommend
 repeat after treatment including PA and lateral views to document resolution. 
 Additional retrocardiac opacity may represent a hiatal hernia, but can be
 further assessed at time of two view study.
