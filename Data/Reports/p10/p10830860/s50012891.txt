                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increased shortness of breath  // increased
 shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation.  There is suggestion of a sub-cm nodular
 opacity in the left upper lobe, which likely corresponds to the known
 pulmonary nodule, better demonstrated on the concurrent CTA.  Streaky left
 retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, a right juxta hilar mass, and
 postobstructive changes in the right middle and lower lobes have substantially
 improved compared to ___ radiograph with some residual patchy and
 linear atelectasis as well as bronchial wall thickening.  These findings are
 more fully evaluated on the concurrent CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.

 findings related to intrathoracic malignancy.
