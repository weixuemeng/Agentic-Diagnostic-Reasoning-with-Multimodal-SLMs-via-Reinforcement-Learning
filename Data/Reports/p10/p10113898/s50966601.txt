                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of right-sided chest tube, there is a probable
 tiny right apical pneumothorax present.  Widening of right mediastinal
 contours at the operative site with associated leftward deviation of the
 trachea are unchanged, as well as a moderate, partially loculated right
 pleural effusion.  Improving opacities in the right mid and lower lung regions
 probably represent post-operative atelectasis.  Additional atelectasis is
 again demonstrated in the left retrocardiac region, as well as a small left
 pleural effusion.  Right hemidiaphragm remains markedly elevated in the
 post-operative period.  If warranted clinically, right lateral decubitus view
 could be obtained to differentiate elevation of the diaphragm from a
 subpulmonic effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny right apical pneumothorax following chest tube removal. 
 Persistent mediastinal widening at operative site, which may represent
 post-operative fluid collection or hematoma.
