                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracotomy with resection of mediastinal mass. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is interval
 resolution of the fullness of the right mediastinum, with interval improvement
 in the right basilar atelectasis. Surgical clips are seen overlying the right
 mediastinum, reflective of previous surgery.  No acute consolidation is
 identified.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 contour is normal. Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again
 noted, possibly related to phrenic nerve injury.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in right mediastinal fullness with now midline
 trachea.
 2.  Interval improvement in right basilar atelectasis.
 3.  No focal consolidation.
 4.  Continued elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
