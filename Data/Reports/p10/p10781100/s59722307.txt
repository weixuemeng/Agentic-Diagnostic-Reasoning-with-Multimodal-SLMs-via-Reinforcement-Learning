 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough + sputum production, on 2 L O2,
 re-spiked fever  // ?interval changes ?worsened pulmonary process ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have increased, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation. However, over distension of the stomach is
 still present. This could be relieved by insertion of a nasogastric tube.
 Moderate cardiomegaly and elongation of the descending aorta persist. Mild
 atelectasis at the left lung bases.  No evidence of overt pulmonary edema or
 new parenchymal opacities potentially suggestive of pneumonia.
