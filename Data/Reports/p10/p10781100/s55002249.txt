                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm, caused by a gas inflated stomach.  As a consequence, the
 left lung base shows minimal areas of atelectasis, with posterior
 predominance, better seen on the lateral than on the frontal image.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or other acute lung disease.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
