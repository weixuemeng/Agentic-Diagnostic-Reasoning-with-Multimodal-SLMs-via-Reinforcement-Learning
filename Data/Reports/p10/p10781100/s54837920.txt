 respiratory consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 23:08
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which still
 more likely reflect atelectasis superimposed on postinflammatory scarring,
 although developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is
 advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  The aorta appears prominent and
 unfolded but stable in appearance.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
