                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with progressive weakness for the past two weeks in
 the setting of productive cough, chills, and nausea  // Any evidence of
 pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The hilar contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes
 are lower than on the previous study with patchy opacities seen in the lung
 bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Slight elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Moderate degenerative changes are again seen in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
