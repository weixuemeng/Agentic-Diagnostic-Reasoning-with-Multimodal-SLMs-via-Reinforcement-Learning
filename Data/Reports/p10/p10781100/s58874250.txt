                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with N/V pneumonia sepsis worsening resp status 
 // ? aspiration vs pulmonary edema vs worsening pneumonia      ? aspiration vs
 pulmonary edema vs worsening pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ and ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given differences in positioning, there are slightly more prominent patchy
 bibasilar opacities, some of which is felt to reflect scarring but raises
 concern for aspiration or developing pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
 advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical assessment. The
 aorta appears somewhat dilated and tortuous, likely accentuated due to
 rotation on the current examination. No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
