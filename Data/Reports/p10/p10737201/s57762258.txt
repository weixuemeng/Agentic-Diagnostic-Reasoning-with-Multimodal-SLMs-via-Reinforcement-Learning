                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated and clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Enlarged right and left main pulmonary
 arteries are again noted, likley reflecting pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  There is minimal blunting of the bilateral
 posterior costophrenic angles, which may represent tiny pleural effusions or
 pleural thickening.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Enlarged right and left main pulmonary arteries, likely reflecting
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 3.  Minimal blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles, which may
 represent tiny pleural effusions or pleural thickening.
