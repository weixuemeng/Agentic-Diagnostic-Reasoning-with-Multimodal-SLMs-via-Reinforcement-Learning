                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post AAA repair with pneumonia and fluid
 overload, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary edema has almost
 completely resolved.  Bibasilar atelectases have increased on the right .
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are probably unchanged,
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction or upper right
 atrium.
