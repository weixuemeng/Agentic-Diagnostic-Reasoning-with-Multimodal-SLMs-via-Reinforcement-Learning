                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ascites, assess for pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with apical predominant emphysema re- demonstrated.  While
 linear opacities in the upper lobes are compatible with scarring, there is
 increased hazy opacification in both upper lobes.  No pulmonary edema is
 present.  Small to moderate size left pleural effusion is noted with bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Increased hazy opacities in the upper lobes may reflect superimposed
 infection or aspiration on a background of scarring and emphysema.
