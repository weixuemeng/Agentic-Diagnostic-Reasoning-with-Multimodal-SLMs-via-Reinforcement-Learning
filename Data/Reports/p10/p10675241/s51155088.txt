 AP CHEST, 5:38 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after polytrauma, now with altered mental status
 and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Hyperinflation and diminished vascularity suggests emphysema.  The patient has
 had right mastectomy and axillary dissection.  I see no focal pulmonary
 abnormality.  The heart is normal size and there is no edema or appreciable
 pleural effusion.  This examination does not suggest but neither does it
 exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
