                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  New PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 8:26 a.m.:
 
 Guidewire in the right PICC line ends in the upper-to-mid SVC, but it looks
 like the catheter extends beyond that to the level of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  Multiple healed rib fractures
 noted.  A thin bore catheter projects over the right neck, paramedian chest
 and upper abdomen.  I presume this is a ventricular shunt, but I cannot tell
 where it ends.  Clinical correlation advised.
