                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New onset productive cough, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 identified.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis exaggerated by
 low lung volumes, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, more pronounced in retrocardiac space, are
 likely atelectasis but cannot exclude developing infectious process.
