                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is slight blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle which may
 be due to a trace pleural effusion.  Minimal left pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  The lungs remain relatively hyperinflated, with
 flattening of the diaphragms.  Mild left base atelectasis/scarring persists. 
 Opacity projecting over the posterior left 7th rib likely corresponds to a
 vessel as seen on multiple prior studies dating back to at least ___.  There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
