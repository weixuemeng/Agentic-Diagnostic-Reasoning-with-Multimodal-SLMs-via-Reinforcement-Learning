                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with suboptimal O2 sats and cough  // r/o CAP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The hila and pleura are
 unremarkable.  On lateral view there is increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region not appreciated on frontal view which could likely
 represent crowding secondary to low lung volumes on the right clinical setting
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or pulmonary
 edema.  .  There is mild right basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacification on lateral view that may represent vascular
 crowding versus pneumonia.
