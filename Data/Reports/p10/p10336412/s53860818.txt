                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the right upper lung opacity.  There is now increased
 amount of alveolar infiltrate involving the right upper lung extending to the
 apex with some areas of increased opacity in the right lower lung as well. 
 The left lung is clear.  Findings are compatible with the patient's known
 right upper lobe mass with post-obstructive pneumonia.  It is unclear if the
 worsened appearance in the right lung is due to lymphangitic tumor spread or
 infection.  However, given the relatively rapid change in appearance,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or infection are most likely.
