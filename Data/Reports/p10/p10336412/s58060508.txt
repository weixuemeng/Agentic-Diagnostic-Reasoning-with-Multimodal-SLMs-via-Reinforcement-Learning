                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT from ___ and PET-CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest.  There is dense opacity in the right upper lobe,
 particularly laterally.  Given differences in technique, this is not
 significantly changed since PET-CT scan from 3 days prior.  Increased density
 projecting over the right hemithorax from compared to the left is compatible
 with a layering effusion.  Left lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.  Persistent opacity in the right upper lobe
 likely in part due to central obstructing perihilar mass better characterized
 by prior cross-sectional imaging.  No definite superimposed acute process.
