                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Probable diagnosis of cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided cardiac borders are obscured, but the heart is probably
 at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable to the extent visible.  Contours are partly obscured by
 opacification of the entire right lower lobe with volume loss and a pleural
 effusion.  A round opacity projecting over the left lower lung suggests a
 nipple shadow.  There is no net mediastinal shift.  There is possibly a trace
 pleural effusion on the left, but not substantial.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Opacification of the right lower lobe with mild volume loss and a pleural
 effusion, probably at least small-to-moderate in size, although difficult to
 quantify.  
 
 2.  Probable nipple shadow projecting over the left lower chest.  When
 clinically appropriate, confirmation with an additional PA view using nipple
 markers is suggested, however.
