                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypertension.  Evaluate for line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  5 portable radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  A cutaneous
 pacer pad is seen overlying the right hemithorax.  There has been interval
 placement of a right-sided internal jugular transvenous pacer, with its tip
 ultimately ending in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right internal jugular transvenous pacer, with the
