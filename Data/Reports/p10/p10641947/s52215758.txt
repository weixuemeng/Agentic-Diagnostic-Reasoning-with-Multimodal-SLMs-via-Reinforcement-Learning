                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia,  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  Widening of the mediastinal
 contour is likely due to low lung volumes.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural
 effusion is likely present along with patchy opacities in the lung bases, most
 likely due to atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
