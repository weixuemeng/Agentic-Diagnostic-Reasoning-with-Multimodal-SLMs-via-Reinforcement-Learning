 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly motion limited study.  Frontal and lateral chest
 radiographdemonstrates mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature, mild
 upper zone redistribution common bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation or prominent focal opacity.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Assessment slightly limited due to motion artifact on the lateral view. 
 Allowing for this, there is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence
 of CHF, and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No obvious pneumonic infiltrate.
