                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung mass s/p biopsy  // PTX?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  There are several bilateral ill-defined
 opacities which likely correspond to postprocedural hemorrhage. 
 Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  When compared to PA chest radiograph
 from ___ the cardiomediastinal contours appear larger, however this
 could be exaggerated by AP technique.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothoraces.  The left pacemaker is intact with leads terminating in the
 appropriate positions.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.  Bilateral ill-defined opacities likely secondary to post
 procedural hemorrhages.
