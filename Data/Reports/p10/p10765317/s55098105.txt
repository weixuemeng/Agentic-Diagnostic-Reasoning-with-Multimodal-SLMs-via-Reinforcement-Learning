                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // etiology of chest pain?
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.  In addition, kyphotic angulation of
 the T-spine in the setting of multiple chronic compression deformities in the
 lower T-spine somewhat limit the evaluation through the lung bases.  Allowing
 for this, there is mild bibasilar atelectasis and presumed scarring.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is difficult to accurately
 assess.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  No pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  Multiple compression deformities are noted in the lower thoracic
 spine with vertebroplasty changes noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
