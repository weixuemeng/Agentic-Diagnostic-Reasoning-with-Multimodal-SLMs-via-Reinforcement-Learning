 elongated but without local contour abnormalities.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No
 pneumothorax in apical area.  Moderate degree of degenerative changes in the
