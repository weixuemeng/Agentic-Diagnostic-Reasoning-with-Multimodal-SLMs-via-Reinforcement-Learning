 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, probably with mild elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  Hazy opacification in the right hemithorax is
 again seen, consistent with layering pleural effusion.  An area of more
 confluent opacification is suggested right above the minor fissure, raising
 the possibility of developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm again is consistent with
 pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
