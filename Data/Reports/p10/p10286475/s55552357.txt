                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Main pulmonary artery contour is again markedly enlarged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is again
 moderately enlarged.  There is probably a small pleural effusion on the left,
 although not well depicted, as well as a trace one on the right.  Background
 interstitial abnormality suggests mild vascular congestion but even more
 striking are confluent opacities in both lower lobes suggesting pneumonia in
 the appropriate setting, probably more extensive on the right than left,
 although not entirely specific.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities at the lung bases worrisome for pneumonia.  Findings also suggesting
 mild vascular congestion.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly with striking
 enlargement of central pulmonary arteries, as seen previously.
