                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath,
 history of CML.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen patchy opacity in the left lung base could be due to
 atelectasis, though underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There is a
 rounded opacity at the right lung base measuring 1.3 cm which may represent
 nipple shadow, can be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.  Blunting of
 the costophrenic angles may be due to trace pleural effusions.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  Calcified left hilar nodes again seen. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities may
 represent combination of effusion and atelectasis, although underlying early
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  1.3-cm nodular opacity projecting over the
 right lung may represent nipple shadow, this can be confirmed with repeat with
 nipple markers.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Calcified left hilar
 node again seen.
