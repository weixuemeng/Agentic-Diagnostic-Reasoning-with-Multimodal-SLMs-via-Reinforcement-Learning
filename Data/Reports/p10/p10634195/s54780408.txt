                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with increased edema, evaluate for acute
 pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is some redistribution of fluid
 into the upper lung zone vasculature.  There is a small, probably left-sided
 pleural effusion with a subpulmonic component given that more is seen on the
 lateral than the frontal radiograph.  Allowing for AP technique and low lung
 volumes, the heart is upper limits of normal for size.  The mediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Degenerative changes are seen in the shoulder girdles
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
