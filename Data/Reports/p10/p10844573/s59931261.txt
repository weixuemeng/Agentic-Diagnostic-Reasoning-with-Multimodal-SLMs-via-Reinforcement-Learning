                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cardiac arrest  // eval for line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses
 distal to the gastroesophageal junction, with tip off the inferior borders of
 the film.  The side-port however appears proximal to the gastroesophageal
 junction and should be advanced by at least 5 cm.  Numerous mediastinal clips
 are demonstrated.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Perihilar
 ill-defined opacities are more pronounced on the right, and most likely
 reflective of moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is clearly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube side port is proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and
 should be advanced by at least 5 cm for optimal positioning.
 3. Bilateral ill-defined perihilar opacities, more pronounced on the right,
 likely reflective of moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia or
 aspiration, particularly in the right lung, however is not completely
 excluded.  Follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
