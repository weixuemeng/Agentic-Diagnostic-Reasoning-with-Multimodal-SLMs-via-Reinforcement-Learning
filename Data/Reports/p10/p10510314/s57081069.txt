                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, hypoxemia on nonrebreather  // eval for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, outside chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is new right lower lobe consolidation.  Subtle interstitial opacities in
 the right mid and lower lung are also new.  Small left pleural effusion. There
 is no pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Mass with post obstructive collapse of the
 left upper lobe is similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.  More diffuse interstitial opacities in the
 right lung could reflect asymmetrical edema, an atypical pneumonia, or
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
 2. Persistent large juxtahilar mass with postobstructive collapse of the left
 upper lobe.
