                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with leukocytosis increased o2 req  // ? pna, ?
 atelectasis      ? pna, ? atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Atelectasis in the left lung which developed and varied in appearance
 postoperatively, continues to clear.  There are no abnormalities particularly
 concerning for pneumonia.  Left pleural effusion and left pneumothorax are
 minimal if any following removal of the left pleural drain.  Small amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema however has developed in the left lateral
 thoracoabdominal wall.  This should be inspected to see if it is originating
 from the chest or, more likely, related to the abdominal incision.
 
 Borderline cardiomegaly stable.  Mild right basal atelectasis and possible
 small right pleural effusion unchanged.
 
 Right central venous catheter ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.
