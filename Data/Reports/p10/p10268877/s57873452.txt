 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, workup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are constant in position.
 
 The pre-existing right basal opacity, with maximum in the infrahilar area, is
 not substantially changed.  On the left, there is decreased visibility of the
 left hemidiaphragm, suggesting the appearance of either atelectasis or small
 left pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The right
 costophrenic sinus is unremarkable.
