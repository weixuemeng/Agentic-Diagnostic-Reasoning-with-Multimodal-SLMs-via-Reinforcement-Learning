                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm passing the stomach.  ET tube
 is in standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic vein.  Left lower lobe opacity has increased consistent with
 increasing atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is
 stable, accentuated by the projection.  Opacities superior to the hila
 bilaterally, larger on the left side, have minimally increased on the right,
 but markedly improved from ___.
