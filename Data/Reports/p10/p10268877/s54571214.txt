                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with multiple arrests and now being
 treated for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  ET tube is in the standard position.  NG tube tip
 is out of view below the diaphragm.  A right PICC tip is in the right atrium,
 unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar
 consolidations, larger on the left side, are grossly unchanged.  If any, there
 is a small left pleural effusion.
