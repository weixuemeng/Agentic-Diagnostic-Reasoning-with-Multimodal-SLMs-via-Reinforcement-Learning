                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with trach, now with crackles on exam, ?pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the
 semi-erect position.  Tracheostomy noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged; bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract reflects enlargement of
 pulmonary arteries and suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to the prior study.  Small
 right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Again bibasilar opacifications are noted
 and are suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis or
 consolidation and pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 context.
 2.  Improved pulmonary edema.
