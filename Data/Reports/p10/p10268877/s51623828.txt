                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman status post cardiac arrest with return of
 spontaneous circulation.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph from one day prior.
 
 AP upright radiograph re-demonstrates satisfactorily positioned endotracheal
 tube, left subclavian catheter and nasogastric tube with slightly decreased
 lung volumes and possibly slight interval increase in degree of mild
 interstitial edema.  Left basal atelectasis is increased with slight right
 basal atelectasis and effusions not well seen on this study possibly due to
 positioning. Enlarged pulmonary arteries suggest pulmonary arterial
 hypertension. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased mild pulmonary edema and left basal atelectasis.
