                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM: S/P PEA arrest, intubated.  Worsening hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has
 improved.  Right lower lobe aeration has improved.  Left lower lobe opacities
 have minimally improved, consistent with atelectasis, edema and pleural
 effusion. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is again noted.  ET tube is in
 standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left IJ
 catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC.
