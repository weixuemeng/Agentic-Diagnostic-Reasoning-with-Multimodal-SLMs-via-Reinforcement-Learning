                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 18:49.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post trach and nasogastric tube placement, evaluate
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:30 am
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 18:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is markedly rotated to his left limiting evaluation of the cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  The heart remains enlarged.  There has been
 interval removal of the endotracheal tube with placement of a tracheostomy
 tube, which has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  The right subclavian PICC line
 still has its tip in the distal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location in the
 stomach.  Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect an area of
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Probable small layering left effusion.
