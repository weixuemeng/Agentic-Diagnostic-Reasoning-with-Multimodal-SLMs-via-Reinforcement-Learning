                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with EKG changes and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  Left PICC tip is not
 clearly delineated on the current exam.  Again there is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of
 atelectasis; however infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bibasilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis; however,
 infection is not excluded.
