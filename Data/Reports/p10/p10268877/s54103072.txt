                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in patient with congestive heart
 failure and PEA arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of portable chest radiograph from ___, dating
 back to ___.  A presumed admission radiograph from ___ was
 also reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates little interval change
 when compared to prior study performed 24 hours ago.  There is minimal, stable
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic
 heart failure.  Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in
 the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is still present.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  A left internal jugular central venous
 catheter, an endotracheal tube, and an orogastric tube are unchanged and
 appropriately positioned.  The chronic findings of atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative
 changes are once again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild chronic congestive heart failure with stable trace pulmonary edema at
 the right lung base.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
