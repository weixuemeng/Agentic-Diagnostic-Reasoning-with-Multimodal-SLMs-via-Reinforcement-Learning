                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with upper GI bleed.  Question acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 clear of large confluent consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette enlarged but could
 be accentuated by positioning and relatively low inspiratory effort. 
 Calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Degenerative changes noted at the
 glenohumeral joints bilaterally.  Osseous and soft tissue structures otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Enlarged cardiac
 silhouette could be accentuated by patient's positioning.
