                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post PEA arrest, intubated.  Assess for
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 AP upright portable radiograph was obtained.  Nasogastric tube, left internal
 jugular central venous catheter, and endotracheal tube which terminates 4 cm
 above the carina are in unchanged position.  Left basilar consolidation is
 decreased with mild pulmonary edema.  The heart and mediastinum are
 unremarkable with calcification of the aortic knob.  Moderate-to-severe
 degenerative change is seen in the shoulders. Enlarged left pulmonary arterial
 contour could reflect pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Decreased left basilar consolidation with mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
