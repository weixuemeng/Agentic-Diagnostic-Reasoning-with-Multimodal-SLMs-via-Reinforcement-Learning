 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged as well as there is no change in the
 tortuous aorta and mediastinal contours. Widespread interstitial opacities
 including the combination of bronchiectasis and interstitial subpleural
 opacities appear to be stable as well as more pronounced right apical
 consolidation.  Within the limitations of the study technique there is no
 evidence of new consolidation that would be suggesting superimposed infectious
 process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen
