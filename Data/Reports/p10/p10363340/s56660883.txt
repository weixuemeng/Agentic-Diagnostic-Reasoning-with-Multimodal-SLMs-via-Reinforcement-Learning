                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been interval increase in size of a small to moderate left pleural
 effusion compared to the previous radiograph. Small right pleural effusion
 persists. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis
 though infection cannot be excluded.  Known nodular opacities throughout both
 lungs, more pronounced at the lung bases, compatible with metastatic disease
 are re- demonstrated. No pneumothorax is present. Heart size is difficult to
 assess given the presence of the left pleural effusion. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.  Left axillary clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Increased size of small to moderate sized left pleural effusion. Small
 right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged.
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
 3. Diffuse pulmonary nodules compatible metastatic disease are re-
 demonstrated.
