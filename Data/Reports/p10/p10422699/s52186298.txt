                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ as well as a torso study
 from that same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD
 device with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, appears
 unchanged.  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  A diffuse mild
 interstitial abnormality is suggestive of mild vascular congestion, but more
 focal opacities in the upper lungs have improved.  A hazy appearance of the
 left lung base suggests a persistent pleural effusion as was seen on the prior
 radiographs and CT, which may also explain elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  The effusion and associated opacity have increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increasing left basilar opacification with a suspected pleural
 effusion or opacity probably compatible with associated atelectasis; although
 an infectious process is difficult to exclude, focal upper lung opacities have
 mostly resolved.  Findings also suggest mild vascular congestion.
