                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-op severe delirium, to assess for right lower lung opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are substantially lower
 lung volumes.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence
 of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The more coalescent opacification at
 the right base is not appreciated on this study.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm persists, and there is some blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
 Left lung shows no evidence of acute abnormality.
 
 The right subclavian catheter tip again is in the lower SVC.
