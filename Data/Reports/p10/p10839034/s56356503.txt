                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, rigid abdomen, and blood in colostomy
 after bowel resection ___ days ago.
 
 STUDY:  SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is enlarged, but likely exaggerated due to patient
 positioning and AP technique.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The right-sided PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction, the lung volumes are low but clear of consolidation; the previously
 described CHF looks markedly improved with minimal residua at the right base. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Supine positioning limits
 assessment for subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly. No evidence of pneumonia.
