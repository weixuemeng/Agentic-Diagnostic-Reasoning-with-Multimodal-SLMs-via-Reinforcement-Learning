                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right colectomy and ex lap for
 lower GI bleed, now status post subtotal colectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  OG tube terminates within the stomach. 
 Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Bibasilar hazy opacities are compatible
 with bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Interval increase
 in right pleural effusion and stable left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 opacities are compatible with atelectasis.  Indistinct pulmonary vasculature
 is compatible with mild-to-moderate edema.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased large right and stable moderate pleural effusions with
 stable bibasilar atelectasis.  Stable mild pulmonary edema.
