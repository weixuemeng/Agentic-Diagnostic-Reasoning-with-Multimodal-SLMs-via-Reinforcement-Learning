                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for traumatic injury in a patient status post assault.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supine portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No nondisplaced rib
 fracture or other sequela of acute trauma is identified.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No sequela of acute trauma visualized.  If there is continued concern for rib
 fracture, dedicated radiographs can be obtained.
