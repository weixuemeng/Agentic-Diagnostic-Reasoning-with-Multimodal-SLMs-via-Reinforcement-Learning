  The lung volumes are low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures. 
  Opacity in the right lower lobe could represent atelectasis, aspiration or
  infection.  Repeat chest radiograph in deep inspiration could be helpful. 
  Soft tissue calcifications over the left hemithorax are noted.  Multiple
  lucencies within the bones are compatible with known metastatic disease.
