 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to outside chest radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Linear bibasilar atelectasis persists, but
 there are no new focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also without change.
