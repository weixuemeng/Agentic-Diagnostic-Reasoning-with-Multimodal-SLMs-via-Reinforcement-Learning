                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Re-intubation, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube
 projects approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube shows a
 normal course.  It can be followed down to the mid third of the esophagus but
 is not seen more distally.
 
 Right venous introduction sheath in situ.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with left retrocardiac atelectasis and minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  Short-term radiographic followup is
 required to exclude the possibility of co-existing pneumonia.
