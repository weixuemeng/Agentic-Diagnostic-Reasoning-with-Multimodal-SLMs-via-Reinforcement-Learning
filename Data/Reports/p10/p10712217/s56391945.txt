                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube placement after advancement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  
 
 Compared with 7:23 a.m. on ___, earlier the same day, the radiopaque tip of
 the Dobbhoff tube has been advanced.  It is now seen at the extreme inferior
 edge of the film, overlying the expected site of the stomach.  Based on the
 available imaging, it has not passed beyond the pylorus, but this would
 require an abdominal film for definitve assessment.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen are tracheostomy,
 left subclavian PICC with tip over distal SVC, cardiomegaly, increased
 retrocardiac density, vascular plethora, and mild interstitial edema, grossly
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval advancement of Dobhoff tube, beyond GE junction. Otherwise, no
 significant change.
