                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina, and a
 right internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the region of the right
 brachiocephalic vein near the junction of the superior vena cava.  A small
 amount of soft tissue gas is present near the insertion site in the right side
 of the neck.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and apparent asymmetrical pulmonary edema pattern which is
 worse on the right than the left.  On the right, there is also an apparent
 layering pleural effusion on the semi-upright examination.  Improved left
 lower lobe atelectasis is demonstrated as well as a persistent small left
 pleural effusion.  Linear atelectasis in left mid lung has slightly worsened.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Likely asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Attention to this finding on
 followup chest radiograph would be helpful to document resolution and to
 exclude other superimposed process in the right lung such as infection.
 2.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
