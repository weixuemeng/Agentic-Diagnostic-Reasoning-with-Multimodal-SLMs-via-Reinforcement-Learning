                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate new orogastric tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ at 2:44 a.m. and a
 series of older studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP radiograph of the chest depicts a new orogastric tube
 coursing through the esophagus and terminating within the stomach.  The
 endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, no less than 3.8 cm above the
 carina.  A right internal jugular introduction sheath terminates in the upper
 SVC.  There is persistent mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening.  The
 left retrocardiac opacity has not markedly changed from the most recent study
 approximately six hours ago.  Atelectasis at the right base has improved
 somewhat.  The lungs are otherwise clear, and the pulmonary vascularity is
 normal, without edema.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Orogastric tube terminates within the stomach.
 2.  Considerable left lower lobe atelectasis persists.  In the setting of
 infectious symptoms, pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded.
