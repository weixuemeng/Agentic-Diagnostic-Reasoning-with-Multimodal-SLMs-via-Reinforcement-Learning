 dense retrocardiac atelectasis and left and possibly right small pleural
 effusions.  Despite low lung volumes, vascular congestion and edema appear
 improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema with low lung volumes, retrocardiac
 atelectasis and left greater than right trace pleural effusions.
