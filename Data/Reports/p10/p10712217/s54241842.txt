                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with GI bleed status post intubation and OG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT, ___, and ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged
 position of the endotracheal tube.  There has been interval NG tube placement,
 which passes below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view of
 this film.  There is increased pulmonary edema, bibasilar atelectasis, and
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also increased most significantly on
 the right from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains moderately enlarged, the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increasing pulmonary edema and now moderate sized (right greater than
 left) pleural effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  Interval NG tube placement which passes below the level of the diaphragm,
 though the tip is not seen on this film.
