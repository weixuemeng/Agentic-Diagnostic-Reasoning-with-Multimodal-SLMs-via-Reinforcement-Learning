                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, lower right-sided rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There are relatively low lung volumes. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation or large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen, however, if clinical concern is high, dedicated rib series or CT is more
 sensitive.
