                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 patient is rotated slightly to the left.  Prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery is again seen, possibly slightly increased, suggesting pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting component of pulmonary edema.  There are small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is moderate-to-markedly
 enlarged.  Aorta is calcified.  Bibasilar opacities likely relate to pleural
 effusions and prominent vascular structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary
 hypertension.
 2.  Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette, pleural effusions, and prominent
 vascular structures suggest fluid overload due to cardiac decompensation.
