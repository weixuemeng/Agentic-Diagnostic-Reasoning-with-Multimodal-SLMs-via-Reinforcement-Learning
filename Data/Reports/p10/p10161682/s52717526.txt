                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stage 4 NSCLC, pleural effusion, pleurx in
 place  // presence of pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the most recent study, lung volumes have slightly increased
 although they remain low.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Right
 upper lobe opacity corresponds to known mass.  Heterogeneous opacities at the
 right base are largely stable and likely represent a combination of
 atelectasis pleural effusion and pleural thickening.  Superimposed
 consolidation be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes slightly increased.  Increased opacification of the right
 base likely represents a combination of atelectasis, pleural effusion, and
 pleural thickening.  Superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
