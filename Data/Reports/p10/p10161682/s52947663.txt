                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with OSA, lung mass, dCHF with worsening hypoxia 
 // evaluation of worsening hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17 32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, the effusion at the right base is larger and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation is increased.
 
 Otherwise, allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval
 change.  Again seen is somewhat confluent opacity at the right lung apex and
 patchy opacity at the left lung base, similar to the prior study.  No gross
 left effusion.  Doubt CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in size of right effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
