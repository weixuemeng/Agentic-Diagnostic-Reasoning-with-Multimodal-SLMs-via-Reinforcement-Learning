                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure with altered mental status and possible right aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again an area of
 ill-defined opacification in the juxtahilar region on the right.  This could
 represent developing consolidation as suggested on the previous study.  This
 region should be closely followed on subsequent studies to demonstrate
 complete clearing of this process.
