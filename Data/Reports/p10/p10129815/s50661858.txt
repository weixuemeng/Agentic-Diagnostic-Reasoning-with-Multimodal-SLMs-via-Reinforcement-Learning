                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea, status post lung
 resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post right upper lobectomy.  There is prominence of the right hilum,
 which may have increased since the prior study and correlation with followup
 chest CT is advised.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 raising concern for small pleural effusion.  A trace left pleural effusion
 would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the right hilum is stable to possibly slightly
 increased since the prior study; recommend correlation with followup CT. 
 Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
