                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___, CTA of the chest of ___
 and prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.  The right
 hilum appears enlarged and abnormally dense compared to the left, but is
 without change.  Immediately lateral to the right hilum is a new area of
 poorly defined opacity approximately at right eighth posterior rib level. 
 Lungs are otherwise remarkable for a persistent area of poorly defined opacity
 anteriorly in the right middle lobe projecting in the retrosternal area on the
 lateral view, and corresponding to an area of apparent scarring on ___ chest CTA.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Small pleural
 effusions have resolved since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New poorly defined right juxta-hilar opacity, possibly due to an early/focal
 pneumonia given clinical suspicion for pneumonia.  However, recurrent
 malignancy is an additional consideration, particularly considering adjacent
 persistent enlargement and increased density of the right hilum.  
 
 Management recommendation for this finding is treatment for pneumonia with
 short-term followup radiographs. However, as there is reportedly also a
 potential clinical concern for aortic dissection, an immediate chest CTA
 should be considered as a CXR is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for
 detecting or excluding this diagnosis.
