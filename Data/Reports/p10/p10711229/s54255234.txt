 AP CHEST, 5:28 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with sepsis and increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved in the left lung since ___.  More pronounced consolidation at the base of the right lung could be
 residual edema and atelectasis but pneumonia, particularly aspiration needs to

 engorgement unchanged, pulmonary vascular cephalization more pronounced. 
 Pleural effusion is presumed but not substantial.
