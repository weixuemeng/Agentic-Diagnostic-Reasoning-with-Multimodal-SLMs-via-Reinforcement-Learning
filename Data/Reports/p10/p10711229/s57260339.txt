                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemia and fever, pleuritic chest pain, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, but the diameter of the vascular structures have increased.  This
 could reflect mild fluid overload.  However, no evidence of pneumonia is
 present on the current image.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly, the alignment of the sternal wires is constant.
