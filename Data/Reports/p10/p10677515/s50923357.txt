                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachy brady syndrome s/p pacemaker  // Rule
 out pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  NO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ARE AVAILABLE.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 TRANSVENOUS RIGHT ATRIAL AND RIGHT VENTRICULAR PACER LEADS FOLLOW THEIR
 EXPECTED COURSES, CONTINUOUSLY, FROM THE LEFT PECTORAL GENERATOR.  THERE IS NO
 PNEUMOTHORAX, PLEURAL EFFUSION, OR MEDIASTINAL WIDENING.  HEART SIZE IS NORMAL
 AND THERE IS NO PULMONARY EDEMA. PATIENT HAS HAD MEDIAN STERNOTOMY AND
 CORONARY BYPASS GRAFT.
 
 THOUGHT MINOR FISSURE, IN THE RIGHT LUNG, IS ELEVATED SUGGESTING THAT THE
 PERIBRONCHIAL INFILTRATION, IN THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE COULD BE CHRONIC SCARRING.
 HOWEVER WITHOUT BENEFIT OF PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS I CANNOT EXCLUDE AN ACUTE
 PNEUMONIA. CLINICAL CORRELATION IS NECESSARY.

 ___ 11:29  minutes after discovery of the findings, ultimately
