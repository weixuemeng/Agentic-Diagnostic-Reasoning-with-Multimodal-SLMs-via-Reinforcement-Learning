  1. New right-sided pneumothorax status post right basilar chest tube
  placement.
  
  2. Extensive diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.  This may reflect severe
  pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, aspiration, and/or infection.
  
  3. Superior mediastinal widening may be due to supine positioning and poor
  lung volumes.  This could be further assessed with CT with contrast if there
  is concern for vascular injury.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Status post arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:32.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment.  Endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 7.5 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip
 courses into the stomach, below the diaphragm, and off the inferior borders of
 the film.  New lucency is demonstrated within the medial aspect of the right
 lung base, with a deep sulcus sign on the right indicative of a right-sided
 pneumothorax.  A right-sided chest tube is demonstrated, with tip terminating
 in the region of the medial right lung base.  Small amount subcutaneous
 emphysema within the right lateral chest wall is also new.  Heart size appears
 to be moderately enlarged.  Superior mediastinal widening may be due to supine
 positioning and poor inspiratory lung volumes.  Diffuse bilateral airspace
 opacities are present may reflect severe pulmonary edema, but areas of
 hemorrhage, infection, or aspiration cannot be excluded.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view.  No mediastinal shift
 is clearly evident on this study.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New right-sided pneumothorax status post right basilar chest tube
 placement.
 
 2. Extensive diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, unchanged.  This may
 reflect severe pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, aspiration, and/or infection.
 
 3. Superior mediastinal widening may be due to supine positioning and low lung
 volumes.  This could be further assessed with CT with contrast if there is
 concern for vascular injury.
