                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT difficult to intubate  // concern for
 PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The
 monitoring and support devices are in constant position, except for a newly
 introduced right internal jugular vein venous introduction sheet.  The lung
 volumes have slightly decreased which causes a minimal increase in
 radiodensity, in particular in the right lung. However, the overall severity
 of the pre-existing parenchymal changes should not have substantially changed.
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
