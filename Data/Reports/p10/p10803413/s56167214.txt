  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary edema and bilateral heterogeneous
  opacities is most likely  asymmetric edema however cannot exclude superimposed
  pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph pre
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypotension, fever. Assess for pneumonia. Additional
 history as per electronic medical records patient with pancreatic
 adenocarcinoma status post Gemcitabine and steroids.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates right port
 tip within the lower SVC.
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral heterogeneous opacities, increased from
 previous examination on a background of bilateral reticular opacities and band
 like linear scarring/ atelectasis within the left mid lung. Cephalization
 noted as well as fluid within the minor fissure. Limited assessment of the
 heart is unremarkable. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Trace
 right pleural effusion. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures demonstrates left-sided lumbar
 scoliosis. IVC filter is noted. Visualized upper abdomen is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Bilateral heterogeneous opacities is most likely asymmetric edema or global
 pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended.
