 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  History of pancreatic cancer and liver metastases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  The heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky linear opacities are seen within the
 left lung base compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No nodules or masses
 are identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the imaged
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality otherwise demonstrated, and no evidence of intrathoracic
 metastatic disease.
