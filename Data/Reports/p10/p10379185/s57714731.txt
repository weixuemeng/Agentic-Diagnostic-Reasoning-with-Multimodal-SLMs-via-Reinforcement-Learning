 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Faint peripheral opacities in the upper lungs, right greater than left are
 compatible with scarring seen on chest CT. Hazy bibasilar opacities are most
 likely atelectasis.  Calcified granuloma projecting over the lateral lower
 right lung. There is no effusion or vascular congestion.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy bibasilar left greater than right opacities likely atelectasis noting
 infection is not entirely excluded. Please clinically correlate. Otherwise no
 change from prior without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
