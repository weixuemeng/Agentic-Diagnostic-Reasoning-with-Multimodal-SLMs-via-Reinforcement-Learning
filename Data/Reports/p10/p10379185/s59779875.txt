                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable with enlargement of the
 pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are demonstrated
 within the left lung base, similar compared to the previous exam. Calcified
 granuloma within the right lower lobe is unchanged. Curvilinear opacity within
 the right upper lobe is also unchanged, with no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  Persistently dilated pulmonary arteries suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
