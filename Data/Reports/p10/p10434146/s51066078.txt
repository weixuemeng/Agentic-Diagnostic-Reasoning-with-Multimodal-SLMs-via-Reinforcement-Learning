 INDICATION:  Confusion after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a heart which is
 top-normal in size, unchanged.  Reticular opacities, right greater than left,
 are unchanged and again suggestive of interstitial lung disease consistent
 with known sarcoidosis.  No focal consolidation is identified.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation identified.
 2. Diffuse parenchymal reticulation suggestive of interstitial lung disease,
 unchanged and consistent with known sarcoidosis.
