                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New biventricular pacemaker placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 The biventricular pacemaker position appears to be unremarkable.  Of note is
 slightly unusual course of the left ventricular pacing lead but it was
 demonstrated to be unremarkable on the subsequent examination.  Lungs are
 essentially clear but there is mild vascular congestion noted, in particular
 at the right perohilar area.
