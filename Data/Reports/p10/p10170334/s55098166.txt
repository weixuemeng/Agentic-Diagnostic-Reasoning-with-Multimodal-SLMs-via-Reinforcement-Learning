                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New biventricular pacer, assessment for placement and
 pneumothorax.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and
 right ventricle as well as the epicardium over the left ventricle. 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial.  Lungs are essentially clear, with resolution of
 previous mild perihilar opacity.  No evidence of pneumothorax is present.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.
