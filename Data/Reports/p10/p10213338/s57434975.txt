                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
 now with slow VT  // please evaluate for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged with dense coronary artery
 calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is not substantially changed in the interval without frank
 pulmonary edema.  Chain sutures are noted in the right apex.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multiple clips
 project over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to the previous examination,
 without frank pulmonary edema.  Patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.
