                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman now intubated s/p exlap  // confirm ETT
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS FROM ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates just above the carina and should be pulled
 back 3-4 cm for ideal positioning.  A right internal jugular catheter
 terminates in the mid SVC.  An enteric tube descends below the field of view,
 likely within the stomach.
 
 There is a persistent left basal opacity which suggests consolidation or
 atelectasis, minimally increased from the prior examination.  There is minimal
 right basal atelectasis.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube should be pulled back 3-4 cm for ideal positioning, as it
 not terminates just above the carina.
 
 Dense retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis or consolidation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on ___ at 1:31 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
