 pneumonia.  A small right pleural effusion is noted on the lateral view. 
 There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is potential mild
 pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable. 
 Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is unchanged, suggesting underlying
 pulmonary hypertension.
