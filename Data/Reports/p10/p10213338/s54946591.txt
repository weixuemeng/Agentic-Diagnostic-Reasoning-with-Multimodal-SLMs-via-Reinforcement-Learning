                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, altered mental status  // focal
 consolidation review of OMR suggest additional history ofSLE, ESRD
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There may be mild hyperinflation.  Again seen is multi chamber cardiomegaly. 
 The aortic knob is calcified and calcifications in the upper extremity are
 noted.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Again seen is
 linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
 
 No focal infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia is identified.  No pleural
 effusions are seen.  Slight asymmetry in the degree of hyperlucency of the
 lungs, greater on the left, may be related to slight rotation.  Mild
 retraction of the minor fissure is noted, but no obvious right upper lobe
 atelectasis is identified.
 
 Of note, there is a rounded density measuring 16 mm in the right infrahilar
 region.  I suspect that this represents a nipple shadow.  Equivocal rounded
 density measuring approximately ___.5 mm overlying the right seventh anterior
 rib was not seen on the ___ radiograph may be an artifact due to
 overlap of rib shadows.
 Rounded lucency in the left humeral head, suggestive of osteonecrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multi chamber cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 2. No focal infiltrate to suggest pneumonia identified.
 3. Mild upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 4. Rounded densities in the right lower zone are thought to represent a nipple
 shadow and artifact due to overlapping ribs.  Consider repeat frontal
 radiograph with nipple markers to confirm this.
 5. Suspected osteonecrosis left humeral head.
