                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough  // CXR: eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is slightly rotated.  Allowing for this, the heart is not
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified, but the cardiomediastinal contours are
 otherwise within normal limits.  Calcified coronary arteries are noted.
 
 Rounded density at the right lung base and at the periphery of the left base
 is thought to represent nipple shadows.
 
 Crowding of vessels noted in the right base inferiorly.  No increased
 interstitial markings seen in this area on the ___ radiographs. 
 There is artifact overlying posterior chest on the lateral view.  While a
 focal infiltrate there cannot be excluded, there are no corroborating findings
 on the AP view.
 
 Otherwise, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Chain sutures are noted at the right lung apex for which clinical correlation
 is requested.
 
 Focal vascular calcifications are seen in the left upper arm.  Density of the
 bilateral humeral heads may reflect bone infarcts.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment of the posterior chest due to overlying artifact.  Allowing
 for this, no pneumonia identified.  If clinically indicated, a repeat lateral
 view could be attempted at no additional charge to the patient.
 
 Mild prominence of vessels at the right lung base medially is thought to
 represent artifact due to rotation.  Differential includes atelectasis and
 bronchiectasis.  The appearance is less pronounced than on radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 Chain sutures noted at the right lung apex, compatible with prior surgery.
 
 Aortic and coronary artery calcification noted.  Vascular calcifications also
 seen adjacent to the distal humerus.
 
 Suspected bilateral humeral head osteonecrosis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dilatation persisting a posterior chest due to artifact was
 emailed to EDQ a nurse's uncovering clinician's at 22:59 on ___.
