                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 17:36.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 15:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal
 SVC.  There continues to be diffuse bilateral airspace process with probable
 associated layering effusions.  This may reflect worsening pulmonary edema,
 although superimposed bilateral pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable, but somewhat difficult to assess
 due to diffuse airspace process.
