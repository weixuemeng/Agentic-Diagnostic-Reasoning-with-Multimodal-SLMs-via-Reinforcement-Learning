                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, CAD, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate mild
 pulmonary edema with increased lower lung opacities which could represent
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Evaluation for effusion is
 somewhat limited though no large effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with lower lung opacities which raise
 concern for superimposed pneumonia.  Post-diuresis films would be helpful to
 further assess.
