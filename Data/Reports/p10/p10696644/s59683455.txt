                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 19:48.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, pulmonary hypertension, evaluate
 orogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:51.
 
 A portable supine chest film dated ___ at 19:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Orogastric tube is seen which courses below the diaphragm and the tip
 projects over the expected location of the stomach.  Left internal jugular
 central line with its tip in the proximal SVC.  There has been some interval
 improvement in bilateral airspace process associated with layering effusions. 
 Given the interval change, this would favor resolving pulmonary edema, but
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity
 to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
