                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Gas gangrene in the left foot.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The interstitium is mildly prominent, which is most often due to airway
 inflammation, which would not necessarily be an acute process.  No focal
 opacification is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality, not specific, although often due
 to airway inflammation.
