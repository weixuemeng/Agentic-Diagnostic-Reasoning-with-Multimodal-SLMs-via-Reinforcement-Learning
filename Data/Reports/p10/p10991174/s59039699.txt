                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and new oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence
 of the cardiac silhouette, though no evidence of change in pulmonary vascular
 status.  The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, consistent with volume loss in
 the lower lobe and small pleural effusion.  No definite consolidation, though
 this would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Dual
 channel pacer device is in place with leads in good position.
