                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is minimal opacity at the
 periphery of the left base which likely reflects atelectasis.  Left chest wall
 pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Heart size is exaggerated by AP technique but there is likely mild
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 large pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Atelectasis at the left base; pneumonia thought less likely but
 correlation for infectious symptoms is recommended.
 2.  The heart is larger since the prior study now with mild cardiomegaly.
