                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is persistent left
 basilar opacity and blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and likely
 enlarged but difficult to assess given silhouetting of the left heart border. 
 Dual-lead left chest wall pacing device is again seen.  Hypertrophic changes
 noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is likely due
 to a combination of effusion, atelectasis and possible underlying
 consolidation.  Probable small right-sided pleural effusion as well.
