                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with asthma, cough, temp >100, flu-like symptoms
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 demonstrated without pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the retrocardiac
 region may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
