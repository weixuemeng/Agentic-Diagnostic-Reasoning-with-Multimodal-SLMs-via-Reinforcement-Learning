                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/worsening chest tightness, s/p PPM  // pneumothorax,
 hemothorax, pleural effusions, pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to a previous study from earlier the same date, a moderate right
 pleural effusion is potentially increased in size although positional
 differences limit comparison.  Exam is otherwise unchanged except for
 worsening linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
