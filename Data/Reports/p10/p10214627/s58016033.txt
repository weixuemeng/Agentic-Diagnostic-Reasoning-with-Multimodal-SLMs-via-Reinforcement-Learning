                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 There is unchanged appearance of the heart size and mediastinal silhouette. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  Right middle lobe opacity is still present, thus
 potentially might reflect chronic changes rather than pneumonia.  No new
 consolidations demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
