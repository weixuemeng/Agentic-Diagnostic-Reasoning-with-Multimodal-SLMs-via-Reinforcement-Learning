                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with COPD, trach, p/w swelling, SOB, wheezing  //
 ___M eval for SOB, increased wheezing, low O2 sat
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggest interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderate to markedly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Previously seen left PICC is no longer
 present.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 persistently enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 represent combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis although
 consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
