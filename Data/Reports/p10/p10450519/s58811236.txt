 HISTORY:  COPD and CHF with fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increasing
 opacification at the right base.  This suggests developing pneumonia
 superimposed upon a patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, and small bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive basilar atelectasis.
