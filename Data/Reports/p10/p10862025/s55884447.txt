                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CHF initially presented with signs and
 symptoms of pneumonia now with involving examination findings concerning for
 M*Modal infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___:
 
 The changes since ___ are best appreciated on the lateral view which
 shows clearing of previous right middle lobe consolidation.  Also on the
 lateral view the posterior aspect of the right diaphragmatic interface is not
 distinct.  This could be due to new consolidation at the right lung base as
 questioned, or alternatively could be a function of respiratory motion. 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly, generalized vascular congestion and mild interstitial
 abnormality are all chronic.  A 2 cm wide lobulation projecting over the lower
 pole of the right hilus is seen on most of the preceding chest radiographs.  I
 cannot tell whether it is a tortuous vessel or a nodule.
 
 Transvenous pacemaker lead inserted between ___ is unchanged in
 position, tip projecting over the apex of the distended right ventricle.
 
 Many of the uncertainties about the patient's radiographic findings would be
 resolved with chest CT scanning.
 
 ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at the time
 dictation.
