                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  The cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged, unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable, with mild aneurysmal dilatation of the
 ascending aorta again noted.  Post radiation fibrotic changes are noted within
 the right paramediastinal lung.  Streaky left basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
