                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, productive of green secretions, denies fevers but complains
 of "being sweaty" at times.  Question bronchitis.  Of note the patient has a
 history of small cell lung cancer status post radiation therapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ in conjunction with CT torso
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Scarring along the right mediastinal border is consistent with postradiation
 change, not significantly changed from prior radiograph.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is also
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  A rounded
 density in the left hila likely represents a pulmonary vesse;l however, it has
 a slightly different appearance from the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2. Rounded density in the left hila likely represents a pulmonary vessel;
 however, has a slightly different appearance from the prior.  Could consider
 oblique radiographs to further clarify.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Telephone communication to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 12:04 on ___.  He notes patient is scheduled for followup CT scan
 for lung cancer this month, which will better evaluate the hila and so will
 forgo oblique views.
