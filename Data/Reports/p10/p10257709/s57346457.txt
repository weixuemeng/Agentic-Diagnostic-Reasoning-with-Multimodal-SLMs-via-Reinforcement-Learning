                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with small cell lung cancer status post
 chemotherapy, and radiation, presents with persistent cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___ and CT chest
 without contrast, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new right upper lobe opacity with a linear border
 consistent with intervening radiation treatment to this area.  Again seen is
 an infrahilar opacity which is largely unchanged and may represent focal
 fibrosis.  There is slight right hilar elevation, consistent with
 post-radiation changes.  There is an opacity projecting over the right lower
 lung field, which is best explained by change in patient position and
 technical differences.  The left lung is unremarkable.  There is stable
 cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New post-radiation changes seen in the right lung.  No evidence
 of infection or malignancy.
