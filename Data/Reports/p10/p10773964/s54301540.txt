                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Generalized fatigue, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  A retrocardiac
 opacity containing gas is compatible with a large hiatal hernia.  Calcified
 nodular opacities in the left mid lung are most compatible with calcified
 granulomas and appear unchanged.  Coarsened reticular markings within the
 right mid lung appear slightly more confluent as compared with prior exam and
 could reflect scarring.  No convincing evidence of pneumonia or aspiration. 
 No definite pneumothorax or effusion.  The heart size appears grossly
 preserved.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged with calcified unfolded
 thoracic aorta again noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  Probable fibrosis in the right mid lung
 accounting for reticular opacity.  No convincing evidence of pneumonia.
