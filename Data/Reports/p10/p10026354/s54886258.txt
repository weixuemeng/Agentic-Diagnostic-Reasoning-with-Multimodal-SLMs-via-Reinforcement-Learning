 NGT  // tube placement      tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparisons.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ 11:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  A right
 internal jugular introducer is in place with the tip in the proximal SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Lungs are slightly low in volume but no focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax
 is diminished given semi supine technique.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits given portable technique.
