  1.  Low lying endotracheal tube with tip 2.3 cm from the carina and recommend
  slight withdrawl. Enteric tube in standard position.
  2.  Low lung volumes with associated atelectasis and resultant bronchovascular
  crowding.
  3.  Left basilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although aspiration or
  infection is not excluded.
  4.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hydralazine overdose status post intubation, here to evaluate
 endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time due to the patient's
 critical status in the EU.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is slightly low lying with the tip terminating
 2.3 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the gastric
 fundus.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in place with the
 tip projecting over the low SVC.  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. 
 No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this single
 supine view.  The pulmonary vasculature appears prominent.  Opacities
 projecting over the left heart border may represent atelectasis, although
 infection or aspiration are also possible.  Bronchovascular crowding due to
 low lung volumes is noted, though there is likely mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lying endotracheal tube with tip 2.3 cm from the carina and recommend
 slight withdrawl. Enteric tube in standard position.
 2.  Low lung volumes with associated atelectasis and resultant bronchovascular
 crowding.
 3.  Left basilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although aspiration or
 infection is not excluded.
 4.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
