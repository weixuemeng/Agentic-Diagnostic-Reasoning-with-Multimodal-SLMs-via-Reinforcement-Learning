                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:23 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate pulmonary vascular engorgement, but I see no focal
 abnormality to ascribe to pneumonia.  Heart is normal size.  There has been an
 interval increase in mediastinal vascular caliber, even though patient was
 supine on the previous study and semi-upright on this one.  Findings suggest
 increased intravascular volume or pressure, or both, but there is no pulmonary
 edema and no appreciable pleural effusion.
