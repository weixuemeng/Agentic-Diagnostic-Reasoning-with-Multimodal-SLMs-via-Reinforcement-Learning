                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  Upper respiratory tract infections.  Pre-chemo.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-rays were acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___
 
 REPORT:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is relatively unremarkable.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy.  Mild fullness medial to the descending interlobar
 artery on the right side is unchanged from prior chest x-rays and probably
 reflects inherent degree of patient rotation.  Metastatic nodules are seen,
 the largest on the right side.  A port is in position without pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No good evidence of acute cardiopulmonary finding.
