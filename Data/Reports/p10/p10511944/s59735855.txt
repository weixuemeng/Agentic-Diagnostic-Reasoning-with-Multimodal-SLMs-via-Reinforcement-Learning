                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CP and SOB, metastatic pancreatic cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the level of the mid SVC.
 Midline sternotomy wires are again noted the lower most of these appears
 fragmented unchanged. Multiple surgical clips in the mediastinum are noted.
 There is a nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lobe as seen on
 prior chest CT measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.7 cm. There is mild blunting of
 the CP angles on the lateral projection indicative of small pleural effusions.
 Vague opacity in the left lower lung may represent minimal atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule as seen on prior CT.
 2. Vague opacity in the left lower lung likely atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 3. Tiny pleural effusions.
