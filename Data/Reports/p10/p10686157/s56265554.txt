                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post assault.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The mid
 esophagus is mildly distended with air, not necessarily clinically
 significant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Normal chest radiograph. Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not sensitive for detection of chest cage trauma. Regions
 where there are focal findings of possible trauma should be clearly marked and
 imaged with bone detail views.
