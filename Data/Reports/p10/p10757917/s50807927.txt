                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypertensive heart disease and new onset AFib.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Prominence of the left
 main pulmonary artery is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 There is a rounded ill-defined retrocardiac nodule, only seen on the lateral
 view without a clear correlate on the frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity only seen on the lateral view.  If infectious
 symptoms are present, this may be treated, and a followup chest radiograph is
 recommended to document resolution.  In the absence of infectious symptoms, CT
 is recommended for further evaluation.
 2.  Enlarged left main pulmonary artery, which may also be assessed further
 with chest CT if clinically indicated.
