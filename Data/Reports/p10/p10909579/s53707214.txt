                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing cough over the past week, productive.  Uncomfortable
 and tachypneic in the ED.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs were acquired.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low.  There is a nodular density in the right suprahilar region that
 may represent a confluence of shadows and possibly converging vascular
 structures, but the possibility of a lung nodule should be considered.  Suture
 material is also present in the vicinity.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Suture material is seen within the right lower lung.  Heart size is top
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal aside from slight unfolding of
 the descending thoracic aorta.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.  A bullet fragment is noted in the region of the epigastrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Nodular density in the right suprahilar region, possibly a lung nodule. 
 When clinically appropriate, evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
 
 The final report including recommendation for a chest CT was discussed with
 Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ the telephone while the patient was still
 in the ER.
