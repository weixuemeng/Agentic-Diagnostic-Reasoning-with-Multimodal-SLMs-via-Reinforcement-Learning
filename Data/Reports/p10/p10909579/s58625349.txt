 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild right base atelectasis and mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 It is also noted in the prior study, again seen is a 1.1-cm nodular density in
 the right suprahilar region which could represent confluence of shadows and
 possibly converging vascular structures but the possibility of lung nodules
 again should be considered.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Surgical clips and shrapnel again seen in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Again seen nodular opacity in
 the right suprahilar region for which further evaluation with chest CT is
 again recommended.  Right base atelectasis.
