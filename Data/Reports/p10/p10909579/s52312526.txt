                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain after cocaine use.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Minimal left base atelectasis is seen.  There is
 also linear opacity at the lateral right lung base also likely relating to
 atelectasis/scarring.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the pelvis.  An
 additional ovoid radiopaque object again projects over the thoracolumbar
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
