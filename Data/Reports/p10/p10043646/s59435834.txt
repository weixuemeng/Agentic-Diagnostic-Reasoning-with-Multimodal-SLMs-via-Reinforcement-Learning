                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS, evaluating for infectious causes of
 toxic metabolic encephalopathy  // ?evidence of infection
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is asymmetric pleural thickening at the right lung apex, with
 apparent retraction of the minor fissure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged. There is probably very slight upper zone redistribution, but I
 doubt overt CHF. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 which is not clearly changed. No focal consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is borderline enlarged with a
 calcified slightly unfolded aorta, but is unchanged. Incidental note is made
 of a probable large subchondral cyst in the left glenoid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change detected compared with ___. Right apical
 pleural thickening, with apparent retraction of the mild fissure, again noted.
 Upper zone redistribution and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 are probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences.
