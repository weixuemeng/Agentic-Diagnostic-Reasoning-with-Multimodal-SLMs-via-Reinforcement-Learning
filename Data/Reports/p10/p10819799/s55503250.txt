 venous catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction, without evidence of
 pneumothorax. There are relatively low lung volumes with persistent mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Prominence of the right hilum is
 stable. Bilateral perihilar prominence may be due to vascular engorgement.
 Right mid lung linear opacity may be due to atelectasis and small effusion.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
