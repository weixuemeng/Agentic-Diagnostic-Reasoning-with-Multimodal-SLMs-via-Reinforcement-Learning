                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy, now
 presenting with new onset fevers and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are extremely low,
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  However, there is also increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema, new since the prior
 examination.  An ovoid opacity within the right mid lung likely reflects
 loculated pleural fluid along the mionr fissure.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema
 2.  Unchanged probable bibasilar atelectasis
