                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 The persistently asymmetric prominence to the right hilus is likely secondary
 to accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. There is no lobar consolidation,
 significant pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema
 identified. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The descending thoracic aorta is
 calcified and otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable, moderate cardiomegaly.
