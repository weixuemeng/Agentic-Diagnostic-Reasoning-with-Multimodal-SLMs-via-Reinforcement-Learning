                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with crackles and wheezes suspect pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with images of the lower
 chest on a torso CT, ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  Extended vessels in the right hilus account
 for greater opacity in the right lower lung, but there is no generalized
 pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Given the appropriate clinical circumstances it should be noted that this
 examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary
 embolism.  Also, the torso CT showed at least some aortic valvular and
 extensive atherosclerotic coronary calcification.  These findings need to be
 evaluated from a clinical standpoint in terms of cardiac function.
