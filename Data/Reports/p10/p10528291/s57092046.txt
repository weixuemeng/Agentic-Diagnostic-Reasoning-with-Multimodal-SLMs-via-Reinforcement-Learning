                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AVR, CABG  // eval for ptx s/p CT removal
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube has been removed. Also removed is the Swan-Ganz catheter. As
 expected, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing minimally
 increased atelectasis at the left and right lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists. There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax and no larger pleural
 effusions.
