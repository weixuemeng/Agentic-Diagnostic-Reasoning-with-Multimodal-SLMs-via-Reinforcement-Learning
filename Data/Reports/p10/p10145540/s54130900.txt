 INDICATION:  Status post assault with right lower chest pain, evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well inflated and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Osseous structures are
 grossly intact.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Please note that conventional
 chest x-ray is not sensitive at detecting bony injuries. If there is
 persistent clinical concern, bone detail views of focal area of tenderness on
