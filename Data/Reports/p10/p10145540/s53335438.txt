                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain after vomiting, evaluate for free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated and clear.  The cardiac silhouette appears
 slightly increased compared to prior study but likely secondary to
 underinflation.  A focal opacity projecting over the left lung base is a soft
 tissue artifact. No free air seen under the diaphragm. Osseous structures are
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumoperitoneum.
