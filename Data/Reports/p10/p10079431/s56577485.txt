                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema is present.  The cardiac silhouette is
 likely within normal limits allowing for decreased lung volumes.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is
 midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
