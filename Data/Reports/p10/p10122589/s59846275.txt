                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia, assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right approach PICC terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Severe consolidation of the entire right lung
 appears similar to most recent prior examination and is likely a combination
 of pneumonia and pleural fluid.  Interstitial edema within the left lung
 remains moderate.  A small left pleural effusion is likely.  Additional left
 basilar opacities may reflect additional foci of infection.  Apical thickening
 bilaterally is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ongoing severe right lung consolidation, a combination of
 pneumonia and edema.  Bilateral moderate effusions are likely.  No significant
 change compared to most recent prior.
