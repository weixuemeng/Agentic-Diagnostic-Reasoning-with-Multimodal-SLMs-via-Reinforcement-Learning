                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 18:29.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema is not substantially changed compared to the prior exam.  Calcified
 pleural plaques, more pronounced within the right hemithorax, are re-
 demonstrated, with continued bibasilar airspace opacification, worse in the
 right lung base.  Overall, these findings appear similar compared to the prior
 exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, and there is persistent
 chronic consolidation of the left upper lobe.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No substantial interval change compared to the radiograph obtained
 approximately 3 hours earlier.
