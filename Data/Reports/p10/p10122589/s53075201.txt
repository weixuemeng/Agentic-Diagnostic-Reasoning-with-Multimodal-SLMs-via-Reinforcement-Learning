                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal consolidation in the right lung has progressed in the
 interval, particularly in the right upper lobe.  A dominant rounded opacity in
 this region has an eccentric lucency suggesting new possibility of cavitation,
 a finding that could be confirmed or excluded by CT if warranted clinically. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema are also noted as well as
 bilateral areas of pleural thickening, some of which are calcified, suggesting
 previous asbestos exposure.  Asymmetrical biapical thickening, left greater
 than right, is a longstanding finding based on review of older radiograph of
 ___.
