                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Again, there are diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications, somewhat more prominent on the right.  This could reflect
 pulmonary edema, though the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be a
 strong possibility in the appropriate clinical setting.  Coarse reticular
 changes at the bases are again consistent with fibrotic lung disease.  There
 is pleural plaquing and bilateral pleural effusions.
