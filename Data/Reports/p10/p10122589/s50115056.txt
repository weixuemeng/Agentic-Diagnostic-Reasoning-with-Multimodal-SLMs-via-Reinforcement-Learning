                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure status post intubation.
 Evaluate for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 20 minutes prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior exam, there has been mild interval improvement
 of aeration of both lungs, but there are still bilateral diffuse alveolar
 opacities compatible with pulmonary edema.  The left apical opacity is also
 stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 An esophageal tube has been placed, with the side port seen below the
 gastroesophageal junction and the tip out of view.  An endotracheal tube is
 present, ending approximately 7 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube and esophageal tube in appropriate positions.
 
 2.  Mild interval improvement of bilateral lung aeration, but with severe
 pulmonary edema and possible pleural effusions.  Left apical opacity, also
 unchanged from prior.
