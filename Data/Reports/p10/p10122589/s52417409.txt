                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.  Widening of
 vascular pedicle is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening
 bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities, involving the right
 lung to a greater degree than the left.  These findings may be due to
 pulmonary edema with or without coexisting pneumonia.  Calcified pleural
 plaques and pleural thickening are present, as well as a homogeneous opacity
 at the left apex, not fully characterized on this portable radiograph but
 similar to ___.  Coarse reticular opacities at the lung bases
 suggest the presence of fibrotic lung disease, but are difficult to assess in
 the setting of superimposed acute abnormalities.
