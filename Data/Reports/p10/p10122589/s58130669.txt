                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.  Evaluate for CHF versus
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, with relative
 sparing of the upper lung fields, with obscuration of the right and left heart
 borders as well as the bilateral hemidiaphragm margins.  A dense opacification
 is also seen in the left apex, without tracheal deviation or obscuration of
 the left spine border.  There is also significant irregular pleural thickening
 in the right apex, possibly secondary to layering pleural effusion.  Right
 basilar plueral calcifications are noted.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed due
 to obscuration of the cardiac silhouette.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Layering pleural effusions are possible.  No fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings compatible with acute pulmonary edema with possible layering
 pleural effusions.  Superimposed infectious/inflammatory process cannot be
 excluded.
 
 2.  Significant left apical density may represent a loculated pleural effusion
 versus a mass.  Followup of this will be necessary after treatment.
