                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again demonstrated are calcified pleural plaques more pronounced within the
 right hemithorax, compatible with a prior history of asbestos exposure.  Lung
 volumes are reduced.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema which appears
 similar when compared to the prior exam.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 appear slightly progressed in the right lung base, and may reflect areas of
 worsening atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Consolidation within
 the left upper lobe is chronic. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
 noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Mildly displaced acute fracture of the
 left proximal humerus is re- demonstrated.  Multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema, similar compared to the prior exam with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities, slightly worse on the right, and may reflect
 areas of worsening atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
 
 3. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques, more extensive on the right, and
 compatible with prior history of asbestos exposure.
 
 4. Re- demonstration of mildly displaced acute left proximal humeral fracture.
