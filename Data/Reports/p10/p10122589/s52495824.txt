                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right approach PICC terminates
 in the low SVC.  Overall aeration of the lungs is significantly improved
 compared to most recent prior examination.  There is decreased density of the
 right lung consistent with resolving aspiration.  Subtle opacity within the
 left base may be related to additional areas of aspiration or atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Mild enlargement of cardiomediastinal contours is
 unchanged.  A calcified right pleural plaque at the lung base is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the lungs, findings compatible with
 resolving right lower lung aspiration.
