  The endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. 
  Heterogeneous left lower lung opacities are not significantly changed compared
  to the radiograph and CT from earlier today, likely atelectasis, although
  aspiration pneumonitis or infection cannot be excluded.  There is a minimal
  right lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm persists.  There is patchy opacification involving the
 left hemithorax.  Much of this could reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 vascular congestion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
