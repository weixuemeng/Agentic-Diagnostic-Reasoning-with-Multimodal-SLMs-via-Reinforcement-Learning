 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:08 PM
  Small right pneumothorax continues to slowly increase in size, as compared to
  radiographs from both approximately 12 hours ago and the study from ___.  The enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm,
  likely passing out of the field of view inferiorly.  Mild-moderate
  interstitial pulmonary edema is not significantly changed.  Findings were
  discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 18:06 via telephone on the day

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Small right pneumothorax has increased compared to prior study performed the
 same day earlier in the morning.
 
 NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  ET tube is in standard
 position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Sternal wires are aligned.
