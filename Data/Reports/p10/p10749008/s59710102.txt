                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating to ___ as well as prior chest
 CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal areas of consolidation are again demonstrated in both
 lungs, with a relative upper lobe predominance, most severe in the right upper
 lobe.  Some of the opacities have a relatively peripheral predominance.  As
 compared to the recent chest radiograph, the opacities in the right lung are
 relatively similar, except for slight improvement at the right base and slight
 worsening in the right mid lung area.  In the left lung, there has been slight
 worsening at the left base but a slight improvement in the left upper lobe. 
 Observed findings may be due to widespread atypical pneumonia, but
 eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical settings.
