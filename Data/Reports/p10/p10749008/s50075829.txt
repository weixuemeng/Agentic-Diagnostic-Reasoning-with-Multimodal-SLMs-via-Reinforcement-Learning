                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Streaky peribronchiolar bibasilar lung opacities have worsened
 since the prior chest radiograph, and could potentially be due to recurrent
 aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia.  Known bibasilar bronchiectasis
 is shown to better detail on prior CT of ___. Heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal, and there are no pleural effusions
 or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities, possibly due to recurrent
 aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia co-existing with linear
 atelectasis.
