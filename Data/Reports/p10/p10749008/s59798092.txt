                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and sputum production.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 are new patchy densities in the left lower lung as well as a vague focal new
 opacity in the left upper lobe.  These findings are concerning for pneumonia. 
 Vague right upper lobe opacity has mostly resolved, however.  There is a small
 pleural effusion on the left.  A round 3 mm diameter focus suggests a very
 small nodular density of nodule, possibly calcified.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting multifocal pneumonia in the left lung.  Small
 suspected calcified nodule in the right lung, not significantly changed.
