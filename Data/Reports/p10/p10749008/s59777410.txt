                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fevers and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Correlation also made to chest
 x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to
 yesterday's exam, there has been interval progression of the right lung base
 consolidation which is now more confluent.  There is also patchy opacity at
 the left lung base as well.  Increased interstitial markings are seen
 throughout the lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Lower lumbar posterior fixation
 hardware is only partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities progressed since yesterday's exam with more
 dense consolidation at the right lung base, worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Increased interstitial opacities extending more superiorly in the lungs, which
 could also represent a component of infection as well.  Recommend repeat after
 treatment to document resolution.
