                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___ as
 well as prior chest CT of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: A rounde focus 0.5 cm diameter area of consolidation in the left mid
 lung at the fourth left anterior rib level is new since prior chest
 radiographs, and is more dense and larger in size than any corresponding
 opacities in this region on the recent CT scan.  Additionally, dense
 peribronchiolar areas of consolidation have developed in both lower lobes,
 again more extensive and more dense in opacity than any corresponding
 opacities on the interval chest CT.  A few small nodules are also visible in
 the periphery of the right upper lobe.  Heart size is normal.  Slight widening
 of azygous contour may be due to known mildly enlarged lymph node in this
 region on prior CT.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly evolving multifocal areas of consolidation, one of which
 has a discretely round configuration in the left mid lung area.  Observed
 findings are suggestive of a multilobar pneumonia; cryptogenic organizing
 pneumonia is also possible.  Follow up chest radiographs are recommended to
 document resolution following appropriate therapy.
 
 Findings entered into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
