                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, ESLD, resp failure  // post ett
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is now intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities. 
 In the right lung, the pulmonary vascular is obscured however there is
 prominence of the pulmonary vascular on the left.  This has progressed when
 compared to the study from yesterday.  No pleural effusion seen.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive bilateral airspace opacities likely reflecting pulmonary edema
 although infection cannot be excluded.  An endotracheal tube appears to be in
 appropriate position.
