 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new right sided chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 08:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a new right basilar chest tube with tip
 projecting along the mid right mediastinal contour.  There is a continued
 moderate size right pleural effusion, perhaps slightly decreased in size
 compared to the previous study with continued right basilar opacity,
 potentially atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Left lung remains
 clear.  Heart size is moderately enlarged, and mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of new right basilar chest tube with slightly decreased
 size of moderate right pleural effusion.  Continued right basilar opacity,
 potentially atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax.
