                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusions and recent hemothorax now
 s/p right VATS evacuation of hemothorax  // eval interval resolution of
 pneumothorax, hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___, CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the most recent examination, both right-sided chest tubes have been
 repositioned.  The overall volume of the previous moderate right pleural
 effusion has decreased and, at the base of the right hemi thorax pleural fluid
 has been replaced by a small volume of pneumothorax.  Residual primarily right
 mid lung opacity is seen, which represents atelectasis.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased right pleural effusion following revision of right thoracostomy
 tubes.  Persistent basal pneumothorax may reflect pleural restriction.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.
