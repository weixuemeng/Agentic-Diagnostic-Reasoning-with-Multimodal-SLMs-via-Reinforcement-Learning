                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hydro/pnuemo/hemothorax with ___F CT in place
 with very poor drainage.  // Interval change?     Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 19:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ 01:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right chest tube remains unchanged in position.  There continues to be near
 complete opacification of the right hemithorax likely due to a large pleural
 collection.  There continues to be slight leftward shift of the mediastinal
 structures.  A tiny amount of air is seen at the left apex consistent with a
 small pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the left lung likely reflect
 atelectasis.  There is possibly a small left effusion as the costophrenic
 angle appears blunted.  The heart remains stably enlarged.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
