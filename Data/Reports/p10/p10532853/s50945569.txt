                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia, chest pain and reduced right-sided breath sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is again moderately enlarged. The main pulmonary artery contour is
 also prominent. Indistinct pulmonary vascularity and hilar engorgement suggest
 mild pulmonary venous hypertension. A moderate pleural effusion on the right
 appears unchanged with likely atelectatic changes in the right middle and
 dependent lower lobes. There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right-sided pleural effusion with probable atelectasis. Findings
 suggest pulmonary venous hypertension. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly.
