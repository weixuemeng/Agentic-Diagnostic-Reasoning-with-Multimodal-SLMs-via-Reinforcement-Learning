                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, and no pulmonary edema is present. A moderate
 size right pleural effusion is increased in the interval, and a trace left
 pleural effusion appears new. Right basilar opacity likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small
 on the left, with right basilar compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
