 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 Interval change?      Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparisons to ___ at 07:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 938 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right pleural catheter remains in place and there is a slightly smaller but
 persistent apical lateral pneumothorax.  Overall, there is improving aeration
 at the right base with decrease in size of the pleural collection.  The heart
 remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  Opacity at the left base most likely
 reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
