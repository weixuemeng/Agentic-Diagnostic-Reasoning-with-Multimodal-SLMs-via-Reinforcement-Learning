 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:52 AM
  
  
  
  Compared with the chest radiograph from earlier on the same date, there is
  worsening opacification of the right lung field, in keeping with history of
  worsening hemothorax and bloody pleural fluid from the chest catheter.  There
  has been no change to the position of the right pleural catheter.  The trachea
  is now midline; previously it was deviated slightly to the right due to volume
  loss.  Left upper lung is grossly clear.
  
  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
  ___ at 20:17 on ___, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening anemia and chest tube with bloody
 pleural fluid.  // evaluate for worsening effusion, consolidation     
 evaluate for worsening effusion, consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 19:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size of large layering right pleural collection
 consistent with hemothorax given history of bloody pleural fluid coming from
 the chest tube. Right chest tube remains unchanged in position.  There is now
 slight shift to the mediastinal and cardiac structures to the left.  There is
 improved aeration at the left base with interval appearance of patchy opacity
 in the left mid lung which may reflect an area of atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Heart remains enlarged.
