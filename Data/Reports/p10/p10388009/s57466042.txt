                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with confusion.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Hyperexpanded lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms correlate with the patient's known history of emphysema.  No
 confluent consolidation is identified.  Subtle opacities within the right mid
 lung may reflect residual scarring from prior pneumonia at that site.  There
 is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 2.  Subtle right mid lung opacities likely reflect scarring from prior
 pneumonia at that site.  
 3.  No acute consolidation or effusion.
