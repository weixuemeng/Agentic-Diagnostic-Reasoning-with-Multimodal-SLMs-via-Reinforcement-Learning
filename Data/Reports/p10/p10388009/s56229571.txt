                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia with recurrent fever despite antibiotic
 treatment, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and CTPA on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is widespread,
 heterogeneous, non-confluent, bilateral opacities with lower lobe
 predominance.  The extent of the distribution of the opacities has increased
 compared to prior study.  The pulmonary vasculature is difficult to assess;
 however, does not appear enlarged.  The heart is within normal limits. There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening likely multifocal pneumonia, likely atypical organism
 or PCP, alternatively pulmonary hemorrhage or drug reaction.
