  1.  Consolidation at the left lung base may represent compressive atelectasis
  from an adjacent small pleural effusion, however underlying pneumonia cannot
  be excluded.  2.  An opacity in the right midlung is incompletely
  characterized and nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, recent admission at___ hosp for PNA
 // Eval for PNA or acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There are sternotomy wires. 
 Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is present.  Possible mild
 prominence the pulmonary arteries, which could reflect pulmonary hypertension.
 
 There is a small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or pneumonic
 consolidation.
 
 There is  prominent platelike atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 Platelike atelectasis is noted in the right lung base.  In addition, in the
 right suprahilar midlung there is a relatively faint, elongated, somewhat
 irregular density.  This may represent architectural distortion from
 underlying parenchymal disease, however this lesion is incompletely
 characterized.
 
 The patient's head overlies the medial portion of both lung apices.  Allowing
 for this, no obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Consolidation at the left lung base may represent compressive atelectasis
 from an adjacent small pleural effusion, however underlying pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
 2.  An opacity in the right midlung is incompletely characterized and
 nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 3.  COPD, cardiomegaly with sternotomy wires, upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  An opacity in the right midlung is incompletely
 characterized and nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 23:01 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
