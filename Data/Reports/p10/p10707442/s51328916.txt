 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube remains low, currently terminating 1.3 cm
 above the carina with the neck in a flexed position.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Improving aeration at right lung base, probably due to a
 combination of decreased diffusion and improving atelectasis.  Probable small
 left pleural effusion.
