                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MR, CHF s/p cath with PAC and IABP  //
 evaluate position of PA line, IABP      evaluate position of PA line, IABP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___:30 and 20:30
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the new intra-aortic balloon pump projects below the left main bronchus
 would need to be advanced 4cm to reposition it in standard placement.  An
 ascending pulmonary flotation catheter loops at the inferior cavoatrial
 junction but ends in the right descending pulmonary artery.  It should not be
 position more distally.
 
 Generalized infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has changed in distribution,
 but not overall improved.  As noted previously it could be pulmonary edema
 alone or pulmonary edema in combination with widespread metastatic or
 infectious nodules.  Followup advised.
 
 No pneumothorax.
