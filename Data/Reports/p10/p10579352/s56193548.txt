                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with report of PNA, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacities at bilateral bases are similar to prior studies and likely
 resent represent chronic fibrosis or scarring.  Opacities overlying the spine
 and heart on the lateral view are suspicious for a lower lobe and potentially
 lingular or right middle lobe pneumonia without definite correlate on the
 frontal radiograph.  These were not present on remote prior plain film. There
 is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  Large bilateral
 bullae are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacities seen the lateral view are suspicious for pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged large bilateral bullae.
