 INDICATION:  ___F with 1-week history of fevers.  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating the hilar
 mediastinal contours, which are otherwise unremarkable.  There are mild
 bibasilar opacities.  There is an opacity overlying the right upper lung,
 along the mediastinum.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities may be secondary to atelectasis given low lung volumes,
 however acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Opacity overlying the right upper lung, along the mediastinum, may be
 secondary to tortuosity of the great vessels, or superimposition of
 structures, however a CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude
 malignancy.
