                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF and COPD, now with new productive cough.
 
 CHEST AP 
 
 There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-ray of 15 hours
 previously.  Increased opacifications are present in both lungs and bilateral
 effusions are present.  Appearances are consistent with known failure, though
 additional infective process is not excluded.
