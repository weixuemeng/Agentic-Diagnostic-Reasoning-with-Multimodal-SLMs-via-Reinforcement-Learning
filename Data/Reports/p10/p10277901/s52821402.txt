                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and respiratory distress, here to evaluate for pneumonia or
 pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  CT chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new moderate sized left pleural effusion with obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm and left heart border, likely representing underlying
 atelectasis or consolidation.  The right lung is relatively clear without
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia or pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct suggesting
 mild vascular congestion, increased in comparison to the most recent prior
 chest radiograph.  Hazy opacification of the right lung suggests mild edema. 
 The trachea is deviated to the left and narrowed, corresponding to the
 patient's known multinodular thyroid goiter.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated but likely remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent with a widened and tortuous thoracic aorta, unchanged
 from the prior chest radiograph with calcification of the aortic arch.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation. 
 
 2. Mild pulmonary edema increased from ___. 
 
 3. Stable leftward deviation and narrowing of the trachea are related to the
 patient's known multinodular thyroid goiter.
