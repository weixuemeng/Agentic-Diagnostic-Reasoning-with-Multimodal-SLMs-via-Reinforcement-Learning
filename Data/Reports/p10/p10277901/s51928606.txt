                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for evidence of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse of opacification of the right lung base, likely a
 combination of layering  moderate size pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Left
 basilar opacity also likely reflects a small to moderate size pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular edema is present. Unchanged
 enlargement of the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries. Deviation of the
 upper trachea by a right superior mediastinal mass, previously shown to be a
 calcified thyroid nodule on CT chest from ___, is unchanged. No
 pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 and bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
