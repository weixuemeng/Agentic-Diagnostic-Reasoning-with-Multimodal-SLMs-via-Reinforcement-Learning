                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Aortic knob is prominent,
 suggesting dilatation of the thoracic aorta.  Atherosclerotic calcification of
 the aortic arch is present.  Opacification within the retrocardiac region may
 reflect a combination of a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Hazy opacification within the mid lung fields is noted.  There is no
 right-sided pleural effusion pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacification likely reflects a combination of a small
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  Infection, however, is not
 excluded.
 
 2.  Hazy opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally is nonspecific,
 and could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process.  Mild pulmonary edema
 is considered less likely.
