                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
 CHF exacerbation requiring assessment of Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube with
 the tip located within the proximal stomach.  The tube should be advanced
 several centimeters more to put the tip more fully with the stomach.  There is
 mild improvement in the pulmonary perivascular haze noted on previous exam. 
 Otherwise, the chest radiograph remains essentially unchanged from previous
 imaging.  There are no pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax or other
 complications seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left Dobbhoff tube in place with tip in the proximal stomach,
 recommend advancing the tube several centimeters to put the tip more fully
 within the stomach.  Otherwise, essentially unchanged chest radiograph.
