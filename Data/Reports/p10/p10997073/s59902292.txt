                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD on HD with three vessel disease with
 mild increase in O2 requirement overnight.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there has been interval improvement of pulmonary vascular
 congestion, some of which may be attributed to PA position. Severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged. A likely small pleural effusion is seen on lateral
 view. There is no pneumothorax. Right IJ central venous catheter projects over
 the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved pulmonary vascular engorgement may in part be related to PA
 positioning.
