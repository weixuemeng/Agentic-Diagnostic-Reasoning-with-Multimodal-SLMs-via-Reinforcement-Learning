                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right lower lobectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study preop evaluation, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is a right chest tube that loops in the
 apex and has its tip in the base.  There is a small right pneumothorax.  There
 is post operative mediastinal widening .  There is moderate vascular
 congestion.  Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is mild.  There are
 bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side.  Increased opacity in the
 right hilar region and right lower chest medially is likely due to
 postoperative change.  Attention in follow up study is recommended to exclude
 persistent large atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
