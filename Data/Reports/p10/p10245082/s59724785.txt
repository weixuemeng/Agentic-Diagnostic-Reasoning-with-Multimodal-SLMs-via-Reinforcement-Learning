  Decreased subcutaneous air overlying the right portion of the thorax and neck.
   Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung have
  slightly decreased, consistent with improved atelectasis and infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right lower lobectomy.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  
 
 Slightly rotated lordotic positioning.  There is evidence of volume loss on
 the right, status post right lower lobe lobectomy, with elevated right
 hemidiaphragm and shift of the mediastinum to the right.  A right-sided chest
 tube is in place.  There is a small right effusion.  There is increased patchy
 opacity in the right lung, nonspecific in appearance.    Minimal patchy
 opacity at the left base is improved. Some pleural thickening and/or fluid
 along the lower left chest wall, with elevated left hemidiaphragm, appears
 stable.  
 
 There is considerable subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall
 laterally and anteriorly.  The possibility of a small nondependent
 pneumothorax on the right against the anterior chest wall cannot be excluded.
