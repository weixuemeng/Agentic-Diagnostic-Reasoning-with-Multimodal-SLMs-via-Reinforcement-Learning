                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Air-fluid levels are visualized in the right hilar region.  There
 is a persistent moderate right-sided pleural effusion with patchy
 opacification again seen throughout the right lung, but slightly decreased. 
 Patchy left basilar opacity is similar.  There is probably a small effusion on
 the left side.  Degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued slight improvement in right lung aeration.  Air-fluid
 levels in the right hilum of uncertain significance but fistulization or
 abscess formation are among the possibilities.  Evaluation with chest CT,
 preferably with intravenous contrast if possible, should be considered if
 fever may relate to this finding.
