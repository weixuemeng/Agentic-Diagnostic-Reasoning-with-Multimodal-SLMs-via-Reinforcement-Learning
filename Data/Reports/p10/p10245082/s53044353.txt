                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Postop day 2 right lobe lobectomy and now acutely hypoxic and
 tachycardic.  Please evaluate for intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates worsened right lung
 pulmnonary edema with more confluent opacification in the right lower lung
 which may represent combination of increasing atelectasis and worsening edema
 or possible central hematoma.  Stable rightward shift of widened mediastinum,
 an expected posturgical finding. Possible small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  No left pleural effusion. Right-sided chest tube is stable in
 position.  No pneumothorax. Minimally decreased subcutaneous emphysema
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in right middle lung, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and edema, though central hematoma is a
 possibility.
