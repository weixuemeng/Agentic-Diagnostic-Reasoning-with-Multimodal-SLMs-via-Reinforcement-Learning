                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post VATS right lower lobectomy
 on ___, then requiring right middle lobe muscle flap reinforcement and
 decortication on ___.  Patient with stage IB SCC.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view chest examination of ___.  The previously identified
 right-sided PICC line and a left-sided internal jugular approach double-lumen
 catheter (probably dialysis line) have been removed.  No pneumothorax
 identified now.  Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The
 previously identified right-sided obliteration of the diaphragmatic contour
 and blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus persists and appears rather
 unchanged.  The previously described mild blunting of the left lateral pleural
 sinus is less marked now and there is no conclusive evidence for remaining
 pleural effusion.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Persistent post-VATS scar formation in the right pleura, pleural scars rather
 unchanged.  No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities and no evidence of CHF.
