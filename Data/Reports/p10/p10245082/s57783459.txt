                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  VATS right lower lobe.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right chest wall and neck has
 improved since ___, but continues to limit evaluation of the right
 lung.  Again seen are hazy opacities projecting throughout the right lung,
 likely edema, with overall improved aeration since ___. A moderate
 right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis are unchanged.  Mild left
 basilar edema is stable. There may be a small right residual basilar
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly improved right lung aeration, but persistent moderate asymmetric
 edema is unusual for this long postoperative course.
 2.  Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion.
 3.  Improved subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right chest wall.
 4.  Small residual right basilar pneumothorax.
