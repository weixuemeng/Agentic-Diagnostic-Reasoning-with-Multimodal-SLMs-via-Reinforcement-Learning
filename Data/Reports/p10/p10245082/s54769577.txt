                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post RML lobectomy bronchopleural fistula, now status post
 Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___ as well as a CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No Dobbhoff tube is visualized.  Expected postoperative findings
 with surgical clips overlying the right lower lung, multiple right-sided chest
 tubes, as well as evidence of volume loss on the right, and subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Overall, there is increased dense multifocal opacifications which
 could represent edema, but without evidence of left hilar engorgement or
 significant hazy pulmonary vasculature, suspect that this is a worsening
 multifocal pneumonia. Right perihilar opacification has increased in size,
 which may indicate post-operative hematoma. Lucencies at the costophrenic and
 costovertebral angles indicate pneumothorax.   Unable to assess for right
 pleural effusion.  Possible new left pleural effusion developing.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Increased right perihilar opacification is concerning for postoperative
 hematoma.  Other less likely possibility include expansion of known loculated
 hydropneumothorax (chest tube does not appear to be draining this region).
 Findings were discussed with Dr ___ at 11:30 on ___ at time of
 discovery.
 2. Increased multifocal opacities are concerning for worsening multifocal
 pneumonia.  
 3. NGT not seen.  If placed prior to study, consider coiling out of view in
 the oropharynx
