                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, status post right middle lobectomy for
 bronchopleural fistula, now status post Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___ obtained at 8:52
 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The Dobbhoff tube is noted with top of the
 weighted tip at the gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced into the
 stomach.  Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the upper
 SVC.  A right chest tube is in unchanged position.  ET tube is noted with tip
 approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.
 
 Again noted is subcutaneous emphysema along the right hemithorax.  Right
 perihilar opacification appears stable since the most recent prior
 examination.  Increasing opacification in the left lung may represent pleural
 effusion versus multifocal pneumonia on a background of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right Dobbhoff tube is noted with upper aspect of the weighted tip at the
 gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced further .
 2.  Increased left lower lung opacity is concerning for worsening pneumonia
 versus pleural effusion on a background of pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable right perihilar opacification.
 
 Dr. ___ was notified of results at 15:03 on ___ via
 telephone.
