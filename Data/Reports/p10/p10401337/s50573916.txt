                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute renal failure, fever, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Probable cardiomegaly with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is upper zone re-distribution, likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic
 angles.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No overt CHF or definite infectious
 infiltrate.  
 
 Right IJ central line tip probably overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
