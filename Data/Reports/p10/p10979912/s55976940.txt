                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Again seen is mild
 hyperinflation of the lungs with upper zone hyperlucency, compatible with
 COPD.  There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  There is persistent
 blunting of the costophrenic angles, which may denote tiny pleural effusions
 or mild scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
