                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are moderately hyperinflated, unchanged from the prior
 study.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. 
 Increased parenchymal markings and relative lucency in the upper lung zones
 are compatible with known chronic lung disease. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes and hilar contours are normal.  Aortic knob calcifications are
 redemonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Chronic lung disease compatible with COPD.
