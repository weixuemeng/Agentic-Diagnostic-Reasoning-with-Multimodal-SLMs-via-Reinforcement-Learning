                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, acute exacerbation, questionable pneumonia or other
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Signs of massive overinflation with flattened diaphragms and loss of
 lung structure in the lung apices suggests the combination of pulmonary
 emphysema and chronic bronchitis.  There is no parenchymal opacity that has
 appeared and that would be suggestive of pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No
 changes in appearance of the mediastinum and hilar structures as well as the
 cardiac silhouette.
