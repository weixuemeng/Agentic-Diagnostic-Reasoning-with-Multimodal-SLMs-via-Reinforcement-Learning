                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Back pain and chills, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Subtle opacity is
 noted at the left lung base which could represent pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting.  Given the associated volume loss, a component of
 atelectasis is likely present.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the left lower lung is concerning for an early
 pneumonia with probable component of atelectasis.
