 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, evaluation of nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 projects over the upper to middle parts of the stomach.  There is no evidence
 of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The pre-existing atelectasis are
 less severe than on the previous image.
