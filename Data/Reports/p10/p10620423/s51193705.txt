                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Lungs are well expanded and there are no findings suggestive of pneumonia.
 Increased intersitial markings are likely related to chronic changes. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a rounded focal density at the
 right lung base which may represent an overlying nipple shadow. Further
 evaluation is recommended with nipple markers. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. No findings suggestive of pneumonia.  
 
 2. Focal rounded density at the right lung base may represent an overlying
 nipple shadow. However, in the absence of prior imaging studies and for a
 complete evaluation, repeat examination with nipple markers is recommended.
