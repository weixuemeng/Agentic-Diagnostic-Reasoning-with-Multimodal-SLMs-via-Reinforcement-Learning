                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ankle edema, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact
 midline sternal wires from previous cardiac surgery.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 essentially within normal limits, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion.
 
 There is increased opacification at the left base obscuring the hemidiaphragm
 and costophrenic angle.  This is most consistent with moderate pleural
 effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Some hyperexpansion of the lung and prominent AP diameter in the lateral view
 suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
