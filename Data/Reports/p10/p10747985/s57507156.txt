                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left base has essentially
 cleared.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with only mild
 elevation of pulmonary pressure, raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion.  There is evidence of chronic pulmonary disease without
 acute focal pneumonia.
