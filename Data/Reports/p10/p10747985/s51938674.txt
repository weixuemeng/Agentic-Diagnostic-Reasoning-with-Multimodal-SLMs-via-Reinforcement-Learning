                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little change compared to prior examination with
 redemonstration of significant cardiomegaly and postoperative mediastinal
 contour.  A central vascular congestion with upper zone redistribution is
 again noted without frank interstitial edema.  There is redemonstration of a
 retrocardiac consolidation which obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  A
 right-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC.  There is no large effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac consolidation which may be atelectasis or pneumonia.
 Conventional lateral view may be helpful for further evaluation.  Vascular
 congestion without frank edema.
