                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pain and fever status post surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Preoperative radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small quantity of free air can be seen under each hemidiaphragm. 
 There is a small pleural effusion on the right.  It is difficult to exclude a
 very small pleural effusion on the left side.  The lungs appear clear.  Bony
 structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small quantities of air seen under each hemidiaphragm.  This
 appearance could be seen with recent surgery but is not specific; if symptoms
 persist, short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to ensure that free
 air decreases over time as it should after surgery.
