                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG as well as cardiac valve
 replacement.  There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles and
 trace/small pleural effusions could be present.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable, with
 the aorta calcified.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  On the lateral view,
 there is irregularity of the inferior anterior aspect of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body of indeterminate age.  No prior studies available for
 comparison.  Recommend correlation with history of trauma to this site or
 history of infection.  This finding was submitted via wet reading to the
 emergency department on ___ at 7:45 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without other
 acute cardiopulmonary process.  Trace/small pleural effusions may be present. 
 Irregularity of the inferior, anterior aspect of the lower thoracic vertebral
