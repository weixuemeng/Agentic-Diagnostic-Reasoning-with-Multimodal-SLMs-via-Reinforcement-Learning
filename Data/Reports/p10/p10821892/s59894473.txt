                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New onset of cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  The only abnormality seen on the
 chest x-ray is small unilateral right pleural effusion.  The effusion is
 better appreciated on the frontal than on the lateral radiograph.  No zones of
 parenchymal opacities are noted.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.
 
 Although the small pleural effusion might mask the lung zone with pneumonia,
 another differential diagnostic possibility would be pulmonary embolism.  This
 could be confirmed or ruled out with CT.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 11:03 a.m., on ___, the
