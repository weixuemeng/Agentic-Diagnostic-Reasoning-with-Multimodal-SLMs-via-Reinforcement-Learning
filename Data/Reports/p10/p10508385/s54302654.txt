                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present, decreased in size compared to the prior study. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity
 which may reflect atelectasis, however early infection is not excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but an early
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
