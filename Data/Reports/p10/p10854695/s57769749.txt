                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___-year-old female with right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right lung appears grossly clear; nodule seen on CT is not
 appreciated.  In the left lung, there consolidation in the left lower lobe and
 an additional opacity in the left upper lobe corresponding to the known
 pleural based tumor and effusion. A Port-A-Cath terminates within the distal
 SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung pleural based masses/effusion account for the left lung
 opacity.  Findings are better appreciated on the recent CT.
