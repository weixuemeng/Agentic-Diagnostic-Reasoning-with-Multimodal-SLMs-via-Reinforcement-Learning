                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic sarcoma to the lungs, on chemotherapy, presenting with
 cough and shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava as before.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar allowing for
 differences in technique including apparent postsurgical changes in the left
 hemithorax with volume loss.  Hazy opacification of the left lower lung
 suggests postoperative change and scarring.  On the right, there is a lung
 nodule that appears new since the prior radiographs, measuring 10 mm in
 diameter and also not apparent on the chest CT.  Postsurgical changes in the
 right upper lobe are similar.  In the right lower lobe, there is a patchy new
 basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  A second view includes the left
 costophrenic sulcus suggesting a similar pattern of pleural thickening.  It is
 difficult to exclude a very small pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings worrisome for pneumonia in the right lower lobe as well
 as a new pulmonary nodule raising concern for increased metastatic disease.
