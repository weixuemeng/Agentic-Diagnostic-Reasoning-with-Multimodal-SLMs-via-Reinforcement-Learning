                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  AVR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe left lower lobe atelectasis has improved slightly, and small left
 pleural effusion has decreased.  Less severe right lower lobe atelectasis and
 smaller right pleural effusion have remained relatively stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Enlargement of the postoperative cardiac
 silhouette is what one would expect given the preoperative size, and
 unchanged.  Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
