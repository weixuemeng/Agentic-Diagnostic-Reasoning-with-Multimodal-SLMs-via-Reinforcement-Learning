                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETOH pancreatitis, open abd  // Please
 assess for acute lung pathology, ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is approximately 2.3 cm above the carina, similar to prior CT. 
 Right jugular venous line tip is near the junction of the right and left
 brachiocephalic veins, similar to prior.  Left PICC tip is near the SVC/RA
 junction.  2 enteric tubes course into the stomach and out of view.  Lung
 volumes are even lower compared to prior, causing accentuation of the cardiac
 silhouette as well as bronchovascular crowding.  Retrocardiac opacity is
 similar to prior.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip is approximately 2.3 cm above the carina, similar to prior CT,
 and may be retracted approximately 1 cm.
 2. Severe retrocardiac atelectasis is similar to prior.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed retrocardiac pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude.
