 Interval changes

 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Right internal jugular introducer ends at the thoracic inlet, as before.  ETT
 probably in standard position.  Left PIC line ends close to the superior
 cavoatrial junction and 2 esophageal tubes pass into the stomach and out of
 view.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema in the right lung has improved, making the
 moderate left pleural effusion layering posteriorly more obvious.  Left lower
 lobe is still collapsed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is exaggerated by low
 lung volumes, but mild cardiomegaly is likely.
