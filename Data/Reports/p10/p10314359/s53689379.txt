 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___ for, the monitoring and support

 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  The pulmonary vascularity
 may beam mildly enlarged.  Hazy opacification of the left hemithorax with
 silhouetting hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering left pleural effusion
 posteriorly with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Minimal
 atelectatic changes are seen on the right.
