                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatitis  // Fluid status      Fluid
 status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube is been removed
 and replaced with a tracheostomy tube.  Continued low lung volumes may be
 responsible for much of the prominence of the mediastinum and cardiac
 silhouette.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms with
 blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests small effusions and basilar
 atelectasis.
