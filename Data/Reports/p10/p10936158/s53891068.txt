                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mca stroke  // Eval pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  This likely accounts for slight prominence of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 There is some patchy opacity at both lung bases, more pronounced on an outside
 scanned-in film from ___ dated ___.  The
 differential includes atelectasis versus early pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New patchy opacity at both lung bases common question atelectasis.  Early
 infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration cannot be excluded.
