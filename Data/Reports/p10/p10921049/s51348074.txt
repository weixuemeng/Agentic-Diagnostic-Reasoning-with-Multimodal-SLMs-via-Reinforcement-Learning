                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post cardiac arrest, now intubated with
 increasing oxygenation requirements.  // please eval for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. 
 There has been interval placement of a gastric tube which extends below the
 level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 Interval increasing perihilar and infrahilar airspace opacities, particular
 involving the right mid and lower lung zone.  A small right pleural effusion
 is also new.  These findings may reflect increasing pulmonary edema on a
 background of chronic lung disease.
 
 The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing opacities bilaterally, particularly involving the right mid and
 lower lung zones.  New left pleural effusion.  These findings may reflect
 worsening pulmonary edema on a background of chronic lung disease.
