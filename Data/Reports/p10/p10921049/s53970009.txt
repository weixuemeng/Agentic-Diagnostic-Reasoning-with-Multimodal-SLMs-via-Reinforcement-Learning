                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with newly placed OG tube.  // ?OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiograph from a few hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from a few hours earlier, there is no
 significant change.  Lung volumes remain low.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 3.6 cm above the carina, unchanged.  An enteric feeding tube
 terminates in the proximal duodenum.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 persists.  Focal opacities within the right mid lung and left lung base are
 unchanged and likely reflect atelectasis, though cannot exclude infection. No
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Multiple calcified mediastinal and
 bilateral hilar lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous disease.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiopulmonary support devices are in standard position. Enteric feeding
 tube terminates in the proximal duodenum.
 2. Focal right mid lung and left basilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 though infection is also possible.
 3. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 4. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
