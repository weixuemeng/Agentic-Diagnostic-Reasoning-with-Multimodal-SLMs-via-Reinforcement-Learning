 the proper clinical setting could reflect an early pneumonia. The pulmonary
 vasculature is slightly indistinct, which may reflect the earliest phase of
 pulmonary edema.There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate hyperexpansion suggestive of air trapping.
 2. Equivocal retrocardiac opacification, possibly an early pneumonia
 3. Equivocal obscuration of the pulmonary vasculature, possibly early
 pulmonary edema.
