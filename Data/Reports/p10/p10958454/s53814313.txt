                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man admitted for right humeral and acetabular
 fractures with a hospital course complicated by edema and UTI.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  Severe right convex scoliosis.  A face mask
 projects over the heart and left mediastinum.  Stable, aortic arch
 calcification.  Stable, mild vascular congestion.  Persistent consolidation at
 the left base with no improvement over the past 5 days may reflect persistent
 left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.  Smaller opacity at the right base
 is also stable over multiple examinations and may reflect persistent
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Stable, small left pleural
 effusion.  Right shoulder hardware is intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged, bilateral lower lobe consolidation, more severe on the left,
 reflects persistent lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
