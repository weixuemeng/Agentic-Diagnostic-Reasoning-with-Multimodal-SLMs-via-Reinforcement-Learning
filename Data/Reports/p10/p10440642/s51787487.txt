                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypotension, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast performed on ___, and chest
 radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
 decreased inspiratory lung volumes.  There is increased retrocardiac
 opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm consistent with small left
 pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  No focal consolidation
 is seen in the right lung.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 prominent but unchanged allowing for positional differences.  A hiatal hernia
 is noted on the lateral radiograph.  There are multilevel degenerative changes
 throughout the thoracic spine.  The bilateral humeral heads appear high-riding
 but unchanged from the prior study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
