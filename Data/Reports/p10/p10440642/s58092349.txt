                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with question deep sulcus on prior
 chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:14.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No findings
 are seen to suggest pneumothorax.  There is persistent left base retrocardiac
 opacity which could be due to combination of effusion and atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation or even contusion in the setting of trauma not
 excluded.  Left costophrenic angle is blunted, which may be small amount of
 pleural fluid.  No focal consolidation is seen on the right.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Bilateral
 humeral heads are high riding with degenerative changes seen, which may be due
 to rotator cuff disease.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen along the
 spine, although the spine itself is not well evaluated due to technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Left base retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the diaphragm may be due to
 atelectasis and/or effusion.  Underlying consolidation due to infection,
 aspiration or even contusion is not excluded.  Blunted left costophrenic angle
 may be due to a trace pleural effusion.
