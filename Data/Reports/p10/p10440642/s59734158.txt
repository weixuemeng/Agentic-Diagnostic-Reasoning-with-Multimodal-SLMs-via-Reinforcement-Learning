                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath; question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, radiographs from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is similar moderate cardiomegaly.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are
 prominent indistinct central pulmonary vessels as well as a widespread mild
 interstitial process, which is suggestive of mild pulmonary fibrosis and that
 was seen previously predominantly in the right hemithorax, but with suspected
 superimposed vascular congestion.  Opacities in the right infrahilar and left
 retrocardiac regions have improved substantially, but with persistent
 retrocardiac opacification and small suspected left-sided pleural effusion. 
 Left basilar opacification is probably compatible with chronic atelectasis
 associated with a substantial hiatal hernia, however, which is hard to
 directly visualize on this study but which was shown on the prior CT.  The
 bones appeared demineralized.  There is exaggerated kyphosis along the mid
 thoracic spine, as seen previously, and bones are not well delineated. 
 Suboptimally imaged on the lateral view only is the upper part of an abdominal
 aortic stent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Substantial
 improvement in right infrahilar opacity.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity, but
 decreased; although not entirely specific, probably explained by chronic
 atelectasis associated with a substantial hiatal hernia.  Suspected small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
