                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p attempt at LV lead  // r/o pneumo      r/o
 pneumo
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Lungs are asymmetric.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, mediastinal veins
 are distended and moderate cardiomegaly has not improved since ___.  Minimal
 interstitial edema is present on the right.  There is much greater
 opacification in the left midlung which could be asymmetric edema but also
 raises concern for pneumonia, or aspiration.  Increased prominence of the left
 hilus could be due to rightward patient rotation, but should be re-evaluated
 with conventional radiographs when feasible.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral chest radiographs when feasible.
