                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with h/o metastatic breast CA with R upper back pain
 // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___. Targeted review of chest CT
 from ___ .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Probable background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for
 positioning and technical differences. No CHF or appreciable effusion.
 
 There are extensive changes in the left upper zone that are in keeping with
 findings on the ___ CT scan, with focal left upper zone opacity,
 some retraction superiorly,  and slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm.
 This apparently corresponds to a previous radiofrequency ablation site, with
 chronic fibrotic changes.  A single clip is noted nearby.
 
 On the right, there is focal opacity at the right lung apex, extending
 medially to the right paratracheal soft tissue. This is similar to the scout
 film from the ___ CT scan and likely corresponds to the right upper
 posterior mediastinal mass identified on that CT scan.
 
 There may be minimal atelectasis at both bases. However, otherwise, no focal
 opacity to suggest acute pneumonic infiltrate or site of aspiration is
 identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Small pulmonary nodules identified on CT scan are not apparent
 radiographically. The possibility of a small pericardial effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 There multifocal degenerative changes in the spine and about the shoulders. No
 obvious lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected. No compression fracture is
 detected.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right paratracheal/ right apical opacity likely corresponds to a
 mediastinal mass seen on the ___ chest CT. This extended
 posteriorly on the previous CT scan. If the patient's symptoms are in the
 upper right paramedian back, then this might account for the symptoms.
 2. Opacities at the left lung apex are stable and likely correspond to a site
 of prior radiofrequency ablation.
 3. No CHF, new infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis noted.
