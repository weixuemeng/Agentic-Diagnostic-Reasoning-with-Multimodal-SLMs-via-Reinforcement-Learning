                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumothorax after RFA to left lung lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Procedural CT performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lung volume is decreased, likely the result of left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  A small to moderate left pneumothorax may be slightly increased
 in size from the comparison CT, accounting for differences in technique.  A
 left lung mass now contains a fiducial marker, with well-defined dense
 consolidation likely reflecting post-treatment change.  The cardiac silhouette
 is unchanged in size, the mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The right lung
 remains clear.  The pulmonary vasculature is top normal, accounting for supine
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small- to moderate-sized left pneumothorax, perhaps slightly
 increased from comparison CT, allowing for differences in technique.  Left
 lung post-treatment changes newly apparent, with associated lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 Findings were discussed with the patient's PACU nurse at 2:15 p.m. at the time
 of discovery.
