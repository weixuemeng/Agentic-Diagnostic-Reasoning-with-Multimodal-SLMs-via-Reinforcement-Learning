                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No definite pneumothorax is present.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged. 
 Assessment of the left lung is limited as the left lung base was not
 completely included in the field of view.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Aorta appears unfolded.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  There may be a small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with the left lung base not fully included in the field of view. 
 Central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Possible small left pleural
 effusion.
