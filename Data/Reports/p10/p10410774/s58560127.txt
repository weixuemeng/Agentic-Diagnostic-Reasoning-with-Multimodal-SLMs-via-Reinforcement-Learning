                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___, CT
 chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged.  A moderate size hiatal
 hernia is re- demonstrated.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted aortic
 knob.  Soft tissue density along the left aortic knob contour is new since the
 previous CT and may reflect lymphadenopathy.  Hilar contours are grossly
 unchanged from the recent CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities appear new from the
 previous CT as are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Scarring in the lung
 apices is re- demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities which may reflect infection or aspiration.
 2. New convex soft tissue density lateral to the aortic knob could reflect new
 prevascular lymphadenopathy.  Follow-up chest CT is recommended.
 3. Moderate size hiatal hernia.
