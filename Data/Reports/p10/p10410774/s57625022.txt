                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent wedge via VATS, please evaluate for lung expansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Unremarkable mediastinal and hilar contours.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Redemonstration of the known right lower lobe mass with overall
 worsening opacification of the right basilar lung zones, not an unexpected
 finding given recent surgery and may reflect edema though worsening of known
 consolidations cannot be definitively excluded.  Possible small right pleural
 effusion.  No osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post wedge resection with worsening bibasilar opacities,
 likely post-surgical change, though worsening of known consolidation/mass
 cannot be excluded.
