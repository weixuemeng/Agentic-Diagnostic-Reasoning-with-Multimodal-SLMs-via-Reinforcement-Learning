                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with slurred/slow speech, status post parietal lobe
 tumor resection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Flattening of diaphragms and widening of the AP diameter of the thorax is
 compatible with underlying COPD.  Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared
 to the previous radiograph.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased
 since the prior study, and there worsening patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 which could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  Heart size
 also appears mildly enlarged with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, both of
 which have increased since the prior radiograph.  Chain sutures are noted in
 the left mid lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Increased small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, increased from
 prior.
