                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is chronic.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  An electronic device, potentially a USB drive,
 projected over the left chest is similar to prior and appears external to the
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic mild cardiomegaly and COPD.  No evidence for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
