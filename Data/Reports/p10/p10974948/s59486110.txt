 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, particularly at the left atrium, but stable.
 The hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Nipple shadows should not be mistaken for pulmonary nodules.  Deformity of the
 left lower ribs is likely secondary to prior surgery.  Surgical clips project
 over the mid upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
