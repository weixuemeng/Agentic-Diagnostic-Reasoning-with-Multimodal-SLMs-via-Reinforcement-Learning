                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count and temperature.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  There is no evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  There is blunting of what appears to be the left costophrenic
 angle posteriorly, consistent with prior pleural thickening that may be
 related to an old healed rib fracture on the left.
 
 No vascular congestion.
