                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Slight increased right basilar opacity is seen on
 the frontal but not definitively corroborated on the lateral. The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but not likely changed since prior given slightly lower
 lung volumes on the current exam.  Surgical clips project over the mid upper
 abdomen. Chronic changes seen in the left posterior eighth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base on the frontal view not definitely
 corroborated on the lateral may be due to atelectasis although infection or
 aspiration is not entirely excluded.
