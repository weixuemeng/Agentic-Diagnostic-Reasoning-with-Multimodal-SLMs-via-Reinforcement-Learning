                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with increasing pain in the chest, assess for
 fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well aerated and clear, without pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  Normal mediastinal contours.  No
 displaced rib fractures are identified  though a possible fracture is seen
 posteriorly at the left eighth and ninth ribs, though this may be artifactual
 due to crossing vessels or reflect prior injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite rib fractures with possible left-sided fractures as
 described above. If continued clinical concern, consider dedicated rib views.
