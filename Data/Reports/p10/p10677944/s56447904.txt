                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is unfolded.  Minimal
 atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged and within normal limits. Streaky linear opacity
 in the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine with partially imaged fusion hardware at the thoracolumbar
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
