 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Streaky opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally likely reflect
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Posterior fusion hardware is seen spanning the thoracolumbar junction.

 Bibasilar atelectasis.
