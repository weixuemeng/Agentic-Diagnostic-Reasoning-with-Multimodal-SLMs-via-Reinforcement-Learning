                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fibrotic lung disease presenting with acute
 chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Increased
 interstitial opacities are noted within both lung bases as well as within the
 periphery bilaterally, compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease,
 previously characterized on chest CT as NSIP.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease, previously characterized on chest CT as
 NSIP, not substantially changed from the previous radiograph.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated
