                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal and
 unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are stable, and the hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is minimal
 streaky opacity in the left lower lobe which may reflect an area of
 atelectasis.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Clips are seen within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
 denoting prior cholecystectomy.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base which most likely
 reflects atelectasis.
