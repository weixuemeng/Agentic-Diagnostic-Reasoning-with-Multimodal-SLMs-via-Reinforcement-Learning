                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain with radiation to the jaw and right shoulder.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear aside
 from a patchy lingular opacity, which can probably be attributed to minor
 atelectasis, noting clinical context and mild relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity, probably due to minor atelectasis,
 with no definite acute disease.  Stable mediastinal and hilar contours.
