 WET READ: ___ ___ 3:41 PM
  Regions of scarring and pleural califications at the right lung base and apex,
  as on prior.  More conspicuous opacities at the left lung apex and at the
  costophrenic angle may be due to progression of underlying lung disease and
  scarring, although infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and low oxygen
 saturation.  Evaluate for pneumonia versus CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited due to poor positioning.  Confluent opacity
 at the right lung base is unchanged since ___ and likely represents scarring
 and previously seen posterior plueral calcifications.  Left apical parechymal
 opacities have progresed since ___ and there is mild opacity at the left
 costophrenic angle as well.  Right lung apex is obscured by patient's chin. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is again seen, but not clearly assessed due to
 poor positioning and rotation.  There might be small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The aorta is tortuous with significant atherosclerotic
 calcifications seen at the aortic knob, stable from ___.  Lumbar spine
 hardware is partially visualized.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are
 redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regions of scarring and pleural califications at the right lung
 base and apex, as on prior.  More conspicuous opacities at the left lung apex
 and at the costophrenic angle may be due to progression of underlying lung
 disease and scarring, although infection cannot be excluded.
