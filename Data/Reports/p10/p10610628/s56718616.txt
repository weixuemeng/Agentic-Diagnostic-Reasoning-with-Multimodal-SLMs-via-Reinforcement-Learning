                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall and lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta. The right upper mediastinal contour as well as the
 right lung apex are obscured by chin flexion, however. There is probably a
 trace pleural effusion on the right only. The lungs appear clear within the
 limitations of technique. Prior open reduction and fixation of the lower of
 thoracic and upper lumbar spines is incompletely characterized but involves
 placement of a fusion cage without obvious change. A moderate mid to lower
 compression deformity along the lower thoracic spine is probably unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination, but no evidence of pneumonia.
