                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall from standing, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT thoracic spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning, with the patient's chin and neck
 obscuring the lung apices.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. Calcifications with
 architectural distortion and fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe likely
 reflect prior granulomatous disease and is relatively unchanged.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
 Right basilar pleural calcification is unchanged compared to the prior CT of
 the thoracic spine. Partially imaged is fusion hardware within the lumbar
 spine. Compression deformity at the T8 level is unchanged with diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  No substantial interval change from the prior studies.
