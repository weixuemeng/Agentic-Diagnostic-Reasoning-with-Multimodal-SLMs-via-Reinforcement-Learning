                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, concern for radiation pneumonitis 
 // new focal opacities?      new focal opacities?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___,
 and chest CT scans ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chest CT scans show substantial progression of paramediastinal pulmonary
 consolidation, with relatively clear margination suggesting acute radiation
 pneumonia. Pulmonary edema is mild if any, but a mild peripheral interstitial
 pulmonary abnormality contributes to some of the apparent worsening in lung
 aeration.  Heart size is normal and unchanged and there is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.
