  Rightward deviation of the trachea appears similar to the study of ___ at 04:37. Lung volumes are low. There are worsening bilateral opacities
  which may reflect pulmonary edema on a background of chronic lung disease. No
  definite evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer getting concurrent chemoRT, now
 with hypotension, neutropenia  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique and projection, there has not been a
 substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of ___.  Considering baseline diffuse interstitial lung disease, and the
 limitations of portable chest radiography, a standard PA and lateral chest
 radiograph would be more sensitive for evaluating subtle or early foci of
 infection in the lungs.
