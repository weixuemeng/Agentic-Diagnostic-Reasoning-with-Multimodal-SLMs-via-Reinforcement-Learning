                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormality is noted, however,
 the left ventricular contour is slightly prominent, a finding which in
 comparison with the mildly widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the
 possibility of systemic hypertension.  No local aortic contour abnormalities
 are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of
 acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No
 pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits.  Comparison with the
 previous study of ___ indicates stable chest findings. 
 Previously raised impression of mild cardiomegaly and crowded vasculature in
 the pulmonary bases is probably related to poor inspirational effort at that
 time.  Thus, there is no evidence of any acute CHF, pulmonary infiltrates or
 pleural effusion in this ___-year-old patient with clinical evidence of cough
 and pneumonia.
