                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, suspected consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is stable.  There are
 subpleural opacities with a predominantly upper mid lung predominance that
 appears to be more pronounced than on the prior study but most likely reflects
 chronic changes rather than interval development of acute process.  On the
 other hand, given the slightly more asymmetric opacity in the right upper
 lobe, it cannot be entirely excluded and if clinically warranted, followup of
 the patient with antibiotics might be considered with repeated chest
 radiograph for assessment of improvement.
