                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD p/w worsening sob  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including ___ and a chest x-ray
 dated ___ CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. The patient's
 known spiculated 1.5 cm right lower lobe lesion is partially obscured on this
 study.  Right basilar opacities appear worsened since the prior study. There
 is probably also a concurrent small right pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis. Irregular nodular opacities in the upper lobes are probably
 slightly improved.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is stable.  Dense aortic
 knob calcifications are seen.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally is
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Ill-defined opacities in the right lung base, worsened since the prior
 study, likely due to a combination of infection and small pleural effusion.
 2. Slightly improved aeration of the upper lobes.
 3. 1.5 cm right lower lobe lesion which was concerning for malignancy as seen
 on the recent chest CT is not as well visualized on the current exam.
