                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent pneumonia, now with respiratory
 distress.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___
 as well as multiple prior CT chest, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the background of emphysema there has been minimal interval
 increase of bilateral diffuse reticular opacities with a perihilar
 predominance when compared with recent radiograph.  There is a focus of more
 confluent consolidation in the right lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Confluent consolidation in the right lung base is compatible with right
 lower lobe pneumonia. 
 2.  Mildly worsened pulmonary edema on the background of emphysema. 
 3.  Bilateral upper lobe nodules seen on prior CT cannot be properly assessed
 with this examination.
