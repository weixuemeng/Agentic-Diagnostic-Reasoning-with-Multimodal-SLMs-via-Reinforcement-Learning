                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath after blood transfusion, to assess for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some increase in the
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications, consistent with worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
