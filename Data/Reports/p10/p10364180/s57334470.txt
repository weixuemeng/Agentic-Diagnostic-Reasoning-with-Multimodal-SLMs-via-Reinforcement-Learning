 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, oxygen requirement, chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known and pre-described
 signs of moderate predominantly interstitial pulmonary edema are not
 substantially changed.  The heart continues to be enlarged.  A small
 atelectasis is seen at the left upper lobe base.  The lateral radiograph
 revealed known small pleural effusions restricted to the area of the
 costophrenic sinuses.  No new parenchymal opacities have appeared since the
 previous examination.
