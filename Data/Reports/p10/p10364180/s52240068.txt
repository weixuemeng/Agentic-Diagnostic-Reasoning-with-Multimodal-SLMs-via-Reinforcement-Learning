                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure who
 presents with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial opacities and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 is consistent with mild interstitial edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are present, with the left effusion appearing new in the interval. Bibasilar
 streaky opacities have slightly increased since ___ and may represent
 atelectasis however infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The aortic is diffusely calcified.
 Extensive emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated. More focal ill-defined
 nodular opacities are re- demonstrated, most pronounced in the upper lobes,
 and better seen on the prior CT. Known right lower lobe spiculated nodule is
 obscured on the current exam. No acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, new since ___, and
 bilateral small pleural effusions.
 2. Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis, however, infection
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3. Severe emphysema. Scattered ill-defined nodules within the lungs are better
 demonstrated on the prior chest CT.
