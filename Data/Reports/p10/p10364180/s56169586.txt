                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion with the cardiac size remaining
 at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are seen with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Discrete areas
 of consolidation are not definitely appreciated on this study.
 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There is extensive calcification
 in the aortic arch and descending portion.
