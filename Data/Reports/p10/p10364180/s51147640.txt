                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Diffuse interstitial abnormalities along
 with micronodular opacities in the lung peripheries likely represent scaring. 
 Previously seen left upper lobe nodule is not well appreciated on today's
 film.  There is no consolidation or pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  No hilar or mediastinal enlargement. 
 Aortic knob is again calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Given the patient's history, a
 chest CT to better delineate nodular opacities and interstitial abnormalities
 as seen on prior CT should be considered.
