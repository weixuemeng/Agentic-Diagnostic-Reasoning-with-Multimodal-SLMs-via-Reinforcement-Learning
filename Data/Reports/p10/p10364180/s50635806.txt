                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, abdominal
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Stable as
 compared to the prior study, there are diffuse increased interstitial markings
 which may relate to patient's underlying COPD/chronic lung disease.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  The previously noted
 left upper lobe nodular opacity/scarring is not as well appreciated on the
 current study as on CT.  Slight prominence of the right hilum is stable since
 the prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta remains
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
