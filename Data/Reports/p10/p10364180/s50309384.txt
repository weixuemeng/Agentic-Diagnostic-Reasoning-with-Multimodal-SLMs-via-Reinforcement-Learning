                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobe consolidation on previous PET scan.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___, PET CT
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged, with
 dense calcification of the thoracic aorta re- demonstrated.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated with centrilobular emphysema re- demonstrated.  Increasing
 diffuse opacification is seen involving the right lung, as well as the
 peripheral aspect of the left upper lobe, findings concerning for multifocal
 infection.  Streaky opacity within the left lung base could reflect
 atelectasis or additional site of infection.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing opacification within the right lung diffusely as well as within the
 peripheral aspect of the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal infection. 
 Left basilar patchy opacity could also reflect another site of infection
 versus atelectasis.
