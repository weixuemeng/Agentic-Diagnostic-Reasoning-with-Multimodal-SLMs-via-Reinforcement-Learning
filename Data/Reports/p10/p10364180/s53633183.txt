                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, .
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to the prior study.
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aside from improved
 aeration in the lateral right lower lung, more generally, multifocal
 opacities, the radiographic highlights of which are within the left upper and
 retrocardiac regions of the left lung, appear very similar to the prior
 examination.  Right upper lobe opacities are probably similar but the findings
 seen on prior CT were not conspicuous radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent multifocal opacities.  Follow-up of the prior findings worrisome
 for malignancy is recommended in the near future using chest CT, since it does
 not appear that CT findings including a large nodule in the right lung are
 well demonstrated on radiography.
