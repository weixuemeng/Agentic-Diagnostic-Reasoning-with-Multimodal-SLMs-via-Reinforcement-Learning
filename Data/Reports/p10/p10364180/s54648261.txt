 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure, evaluation for endotracheal tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The lung volumes are slightly lower, potentially caused by lower ventilatory
 pressure.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is in unchanged position.  The tip
 projects 3 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube shows unchanged course
 and position.
