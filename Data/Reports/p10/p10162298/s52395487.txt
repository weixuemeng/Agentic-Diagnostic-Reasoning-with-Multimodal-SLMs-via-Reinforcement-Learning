                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sarcoidosis with COPD and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Extensive
 scarring in the mid lungs again noted without significant change in overall
 appearance from prior exam.  There is no new consolidation.  There is blunting
 of the left CP angle which could indicate a small effusion versus pleural
 thickening.  The heart size appears grossly stable.  The mediastinal contour
 is unchanged.  No acute bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral scarring in the lungs, overall stable from
 prior exam, compatible with sarcoidosis.  No new consolidation is seen. 
 Possible tiny left pleural effusion.
