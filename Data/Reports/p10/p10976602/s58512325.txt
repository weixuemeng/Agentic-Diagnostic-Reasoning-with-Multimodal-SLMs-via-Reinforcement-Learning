                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker leads
 terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle in unchanged positions. 
 There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is unchanged. 
 The aorta remains unfolded.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm is chronic.  No definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is noted, though there are streaky opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflecting atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There
 are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. No displaced rib
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and chronic elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm. No definite displaced rib fractures seen, though if there is
 continued concern, then a dedicated rib series can be obtained.
