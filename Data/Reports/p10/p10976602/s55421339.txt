                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF, presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position.  Elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm persists.  There is obscuration of both hemidiaphragms
 which may be due to pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis and pulmonary edema suggest heart failure.  Underlying
 consolidation at the lung bases is not excluded.
