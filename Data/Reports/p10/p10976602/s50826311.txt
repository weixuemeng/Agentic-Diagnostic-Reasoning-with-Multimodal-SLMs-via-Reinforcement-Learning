                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric postprandial pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer is re- demonstrated with leads in unchanged positions in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted with
 dense mitral annular calcifications.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aortic arch are present with unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  A small left pleural effusion appears
 relatively unchanged with interval decrease in size of the small right pleural
 effusion.  Opacification in the left lung base is nonspecific and may reflect
 an and atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine with
 degenerative changes is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion, relatively unchanged, with opacification of the
 left lung base, potentially atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Near complete resolution of the small right pleural effusion.
