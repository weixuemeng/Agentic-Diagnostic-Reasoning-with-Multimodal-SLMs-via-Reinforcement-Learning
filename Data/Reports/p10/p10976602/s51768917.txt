 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device appears similar with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild cardiomegaly. 
 There is similar relative elevation of the left diaphragm with associated
 streaky opacification suggesting minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.  There is similar moderate
 rightward convex curvature centered along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
