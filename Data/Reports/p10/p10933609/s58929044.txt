                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to multiple prior
 exams including CT torso from ___ with most recent x-ray from ___.
 
 When compared to most recent exam, there has been near complete resolution of
 the right upper lung opacity.  There is evidence of scarring at the upper
 lobes bilaterally with retraction of the hila and some nodular densities,
 particularly in the left upper lung.  These have been seen on multiple prior
 exams.  Minimal blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle may
 represent trace effusion.  There is no large confluent consolidation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous structures, noting
 multiple orthopedic screws projecting over the right glenoid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially complete resolution of the right upper lobe opacity
 seen on prior.  Findings suggestive of underlying chronic upper lobe scarring,
 although superimposed acute infectious process, particularly on the left, is
 not completely excluded.
