                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  When compared
 with multiple prior studies, there is bilateral upper lung scarring with
 slight retraction of the bronchovasculature.  There is no definite sign of new
 consolidation with relative opacity at the right heart border on the frontal
 view, not convincing for pneumonia.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours appear stable.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiograph with upper lung scarring.  Subtle opacity
 in the right lower lung, likely crowding of bronchovasculature.
