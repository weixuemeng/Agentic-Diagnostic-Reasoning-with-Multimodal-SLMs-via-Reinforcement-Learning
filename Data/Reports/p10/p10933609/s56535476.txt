                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  The right PICC has been removed.  As before, there
 is continued upward retraction of the hila with bilateral upper lobe scarring,
 similar when compared to the prior study.  Findings may reflect prior
 sarcoidosis or tuberculosis.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base may
 reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Projecting over previous left upper quadrant of the abdomen is a surgical
 clip.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral upper lobe scarring with upward retraction of hila suggestive of
 sarcoidosis or prior tuberculosis which is similar compared to prior studies. 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis but infection
 cannot be excluded.
