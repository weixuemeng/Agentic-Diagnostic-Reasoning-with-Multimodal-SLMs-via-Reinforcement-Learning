                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  A right upper lobe
 consolidation with air bronchograms is similar to ___.  Focal
 tubular lucency within the opacity is new and may reflect cavitation, dilated
 airways or spared lung parenchyma.  Opacity in the right lower lobe has
 progressed since the prior study.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is mild thickening of the
 left major fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Non-resolving right upper lobe pneumonia superimposed on bilateral juxtahilar
 scarring which could be due to prior granulomatous process such as TB or
 sarcoid.
 
 Consider CT to further evaluate the right upper lobe and to exclude central
 necrosis, as well as to further characterize for causes of non-resolving
 pneumonia.
