                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Weight loss and history of aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Multifocal opacities which persist in the upper lungs with volume loss suggest
 chronic scarring without definite superimposed disease.  Blunting of the left
 posterior costophrenic sulcus is unchanged, suggesting either trace pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
