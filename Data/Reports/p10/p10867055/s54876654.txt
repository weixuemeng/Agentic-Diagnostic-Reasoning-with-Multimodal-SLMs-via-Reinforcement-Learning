                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia and increasing oxygen requirement,
 status post right chest tube placement for pneumothorax, here to reevaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs performed earlier the same day at 02:25 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at
 the cavoatrial junction.  A right pleural pigtail catheter appears stable. 
 There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  There is persistent hazy
 opacification at the right mid-to-lower lung zone and silhouetting of the
 right costophrenic angle compatible with small layering pleural effusion,
 unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, most likely represents
 left basilar atelectasis with possible trace pleural fluid.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged layering right pleural effusion and
 increased left basilar atelectasis.
