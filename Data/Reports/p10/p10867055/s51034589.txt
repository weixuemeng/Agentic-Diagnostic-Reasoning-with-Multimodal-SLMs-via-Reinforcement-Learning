                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent history of hepatitis C and
 splenectomy in ___.  Transferred from OSH with sepsis, status post chest
 tube placement to drain right pleural effusion.  Assessment for right
 pneumothorax versus other cause of increased short of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to yesterday, moderate right pleural effusion is
 stable, and there are no signs of pneumothorax.  The position of the right
 pigtail pleural drain is unchanged, and could be fissural so it might not
 continue to drain effectively.  The lung volume asymmetry persists, with right
 lung smaller than the left lung due right base atelectasis.  The amount of
 pleural effusion is stable, mainly in the right lung base and with minimal
 intrafissural component.  Stable left mid-lung opacity, already described in
 recent CT, without pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax. The pig-tail pleural drainage ___ might be in
 the major fissure and it might not continue to work properly. Persistent
 reduced right lung volume due to right basal atelectasis and moderate pleural
 effusion.
