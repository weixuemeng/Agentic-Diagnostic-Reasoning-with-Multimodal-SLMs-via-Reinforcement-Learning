 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pulling of the right chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided chest tube
 has been pulled.  There is no evidence of right pneumothorax.  The left PICC
 line is in unchanged position.  Unchanged consolidations surround the right
 hilus.  Overall, the lungs have increased in transparency, reflecting improved
 ventilation.
 
 A small left pleural effusion is constant in appearance.
