                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left chest pain after MVC  // eval for rib of
 lung injury      eval for rib of lung injury
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Lungs are low in volume but clear.  Heart is mildly and enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are otherwise normal.  There is no hilar or pleural abnormality.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
