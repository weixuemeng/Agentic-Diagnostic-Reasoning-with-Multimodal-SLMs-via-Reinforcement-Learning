                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mental status change, renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with a small hiatal hernia again noted.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Minimal bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
