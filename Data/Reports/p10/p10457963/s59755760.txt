                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hepatitis B cirrhosis, presents with confusion
 and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is large right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Based on the relative inferior displacement of the right
 hilum and configuration of the pleural reflections on the lateral, there is
 likely complete right lower lobe collapse.  The left lung is grossly clear. 
 Cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to silhouetting on the right and
 low lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right-sided pleural effusion and right lower lobe
 atelectasis.
