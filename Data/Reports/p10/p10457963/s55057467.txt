                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and CTA of the abdomen of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion has increased in size and is now at least
 moderate, with a subpulmonic component.  Apparent interval increase in width
 of the right cardiac contour could reflect pericardial effusion or medially
 loculated pleural effusion mimicking pericardial disease.  In addition to
 right retrocardiac atelectasis adjacent to the pleural effusion, linear
 atelectasis has developed in the right upper lobe adjacent to a fluid-filled
 azygous fissure.  The left lung is clear.  Small left pleural effusion has
 slightly increased in size.  Diffusely distended loops of bowel are present in
 the imaged portion of the upper abdomen and are not fully evaluated on this
 chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right pleural effusion with subpulmonic component. Change in
 configuration of right heart border could reflect a medially loculated
 component of pleural fluid or a pericardial effusion.  Right lateral decubitus
 chest x-ray may be helpful to better assess the quantity of pleural fluid and
 to assess for layering.
 2.  Slight increase in size of small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Distended loops of large bowel in the upper abdomen are incompletely
 evaluated on this chest radiograph.
