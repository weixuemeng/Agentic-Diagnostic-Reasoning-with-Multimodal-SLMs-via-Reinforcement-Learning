                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with liver transplant.  Evaluate central lines and
 catheter positions.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There has been placement of endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.6 cm above
 the carina, appropriately sited.  There is a Swan-___ catheter whose distal
 tip is in the main pulmonary outflow tract.  There is an enteric tube with
 sideport at the GE junction and this could be advanced several centimeters for
 more optimal placement.  There is an unchanged left-sided PICC line with
 distal lead tip at the distal SVC.  The heart size is enlarged but stable. 
 There has been resolution of the previously seen very large right-sided
 pleural effusion.  There is some mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
 markings.  There are no pneumothoraces.  There is a developing left
 retrocardiac opacity with a small left-sided pleural effusion.
