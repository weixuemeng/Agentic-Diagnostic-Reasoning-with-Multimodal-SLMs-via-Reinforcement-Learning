                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hip frx.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously described right basilar focal opacity has resolved.  There is
 decreased aeration at the left lung base, which could be due to a combination
 of atelectasis, effusion, or consolidation.  Accounting for patient
 positioning, the cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax. 
 Old healed left upper posterior rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity could be any combination of atelectasis, infection, or
 effusion.  Consider PA/lateral chest radiograph if patient is amenable.
