                                 FINAL REPORT
 Patient STEMI coder, intubated, evaluation for effusion, edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends at 3.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Left lower lobe collapse has improved since ___.  There
 is only minimal bibasilar opacity, mostly compatible with atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 
 2.  Minimal bibasilar opacity is mostly compatible with atelectasis
 considering the low lung volumes.
