  Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
  been interval placement of an apically oriented chest tube on the right. 
  Other support lines/devices are in standard position.  Dense left retrocardiac
  opacity is new, and likely reflects atelectasis.  Layering right pleural
  effusion appears to have decreased.  There is likely also a small left pleural
  effusion.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p right colectmy and ileostomy admitted for septic shock,
 ___, and DKA s/p chest tube placement  // interval change of right effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison the prior radiograph from earlier today, a right-sided chest
 tube is been placed, with reduction in size of right pleural effusion and no
 visible pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.  Exam is otherwise remarkable
 for this the worsening opacification in the left lower hemi thorax, likely a
 combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis in the left
 lower lobe.  No other relevant change.
