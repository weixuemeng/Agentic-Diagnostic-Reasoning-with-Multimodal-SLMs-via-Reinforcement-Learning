                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p intubation for resp failure.  Evaluate for
 ETT location.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to exam performed 6 hours prior, there is mild improvement of the
 right interstitial opacities, possibly due to better aeration.  There is
 increased volume loss on the left with elevation of left hemidiaphragm and
 leftward mediastinal shift, likely due to lower lobe collapse and small amount
 of pleural fluid.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  ETT terminates
 approximately 3.3 cm from the carina.  There is no significant change in
 monitoring and support devices.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse with minimal pleural effusion.
 2. ET tube in standard position.
