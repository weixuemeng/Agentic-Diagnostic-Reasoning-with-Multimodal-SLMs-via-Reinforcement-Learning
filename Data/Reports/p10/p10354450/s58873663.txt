                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p small bowel perf with open abdomen  // eval
 for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Again there are very low lung volumes that
 accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Little if any vascular
 congestion.
 Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss
 in the left lower lobe, and there are probably small pleural effusions on both
 sides.
