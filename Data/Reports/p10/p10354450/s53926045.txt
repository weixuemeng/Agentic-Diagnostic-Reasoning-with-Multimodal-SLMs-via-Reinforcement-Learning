                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, fever, hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size is decreased compared
 with the prior study, now appearing borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are mild patchy opacities in the lung bases in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in lung bases, potentially atelectasis,
 but infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
