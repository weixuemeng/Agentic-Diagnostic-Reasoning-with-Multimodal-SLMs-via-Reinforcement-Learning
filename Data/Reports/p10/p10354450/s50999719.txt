                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis, status post sigmoid colectomy to
 look for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with the
 prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The patient has
 received a new subclavian line with its tip terminating approximately at the
 level of the cavoatrial junction/right upper atrium.  Orogastric tube courses
 below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off the
 radiographic view.  Bilateral lung volumes remain low.  Increased opacity in
 the left lower lung with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm margins and
 increased retrocardiac density reflects probably a combination of atelectasis
 and/or effusion and has minimally increased since ___. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a stable appearance.  There are no other
 interval changes in the lungs.
