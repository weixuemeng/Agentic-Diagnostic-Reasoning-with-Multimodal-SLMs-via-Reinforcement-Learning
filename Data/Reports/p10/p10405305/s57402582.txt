  are grossly clear.  Apparent widening of the mediastinal contour likely
  related to patient positioning as well as AP technique.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p thoracotomy and multiple wedge resections  //
 please evaluate tube placement and for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widening of the cardiomediastinal contours is likely due to accentuation by
 patient rotation and low lung volumes, but repeat radiograph would be helpful
 to confirm this impression.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for minor bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
