                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes.  Given this, there is minimal left base
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of slight widening of the right
 acromioclavicular joint, of indeterminate age; the full left acromioclavicular
 joint was not imaged.  Please correlate with site of pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but clear lungs.  Incidental note is made of
 widening of the right acromioclavicular joint, not well evaluated on this
 study.  Consider dedicated imaging of the distal right
 clavicle/acromioclavicular joint as clinically warranted.
