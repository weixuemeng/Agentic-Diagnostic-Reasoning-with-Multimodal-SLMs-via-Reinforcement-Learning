                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes is likely due to
 mediastinal lipomatosis seen on the prior CT, accentuated by low lung volumes.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No displaced rib fracture is seen. There is
 no free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
