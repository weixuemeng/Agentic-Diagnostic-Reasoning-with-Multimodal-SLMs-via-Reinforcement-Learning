 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Newly inserted to transesophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but
 would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to move all side ports beyond the GE
 junction.  The gastric care distension is still present but cannot be fully
 assessed on views limited to the upper abdomen.  The upper esophagus is
 focally distended with air, giving the appearance of a Zenker's diverticulum,
 but that does not appear to be the case according to findings on the torso CT
 ___.
 
 Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged.  Small left pleural effusion
 is new.  Upper lungs clear.  Heart size normal.
