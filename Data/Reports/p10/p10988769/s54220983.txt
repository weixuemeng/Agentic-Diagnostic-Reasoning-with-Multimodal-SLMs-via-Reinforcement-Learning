                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of stroke-like symptoms.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is status post CABG with multiple clips seen in the left
 hemithorax.  The left heart border and left mediastinal border are not well
 seen, likely secondary to a small left pleural effusion with adjacent focal
 opacity, which may be secondary to atelectasis, however a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  Median sternotomy wires appear to be
 intact.  The right lung demonstrates mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 otherwise is unremarkable.  There is mild right-sided atelectasis. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent opacity, likely secondary to
 atelectasis, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
