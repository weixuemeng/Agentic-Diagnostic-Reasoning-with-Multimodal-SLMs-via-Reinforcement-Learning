 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, productive cough and fever, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study, resulting in mild bibasilar bronchovascular crowding.  Increased
 opacity in the right anterior upper lobe may represent developing pneumonia. 
 No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacity in the anterior right upper lobe best
 appreciated on the lateral radiograph concerning for developing pneumonia.
