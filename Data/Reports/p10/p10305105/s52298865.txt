                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchiectasis with cough with little improvement on antibiotics.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change.  No
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. 
 Some hyperexpansion of the lungs with upper lobe lucency raises the
 possibility of chronic pulmonary disease.
