                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with upper zone vascular
 redistribution, peribronchial cuffing, and overall worsening of diffuse
 reticular and nodular opacities bilaterally.  Additionally, there are a few
 larger poorly defined nodular opacities in the mid and lower lungs which
 appear slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.  There are no
 segmental or lobar areas of confluent consolidation.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, with some extension of fluid into the fissures.
 Unchanged compression deformity in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall worsening of interstitial pattern, likely due to atypical
 pneumonia, although coexisting hydrostatic edema is possible in the setting of
 cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular redistribution.
