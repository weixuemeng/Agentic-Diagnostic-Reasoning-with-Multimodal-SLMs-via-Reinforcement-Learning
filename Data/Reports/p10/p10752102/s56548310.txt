  Increased interstitial prominence particularly peripherally in the lower lungs
  could reflect mild pulmonary edema or given the clinical concern an atypical
  infectious process.  PICC terminates in the lower SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with AML and MDS, presenting with cough and hematuria. 
 Evaluate for atypical pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, there has been removal of the left
 chest wall port and catheter.  The right PICC line terminates in the low SVC. 
 The airway is midline and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal
 aside from a mildly tortuous descending aorta.  There is mild increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally, possibly indicating mild pulmonary edema or
 an atypical infectious process.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC terminating in the lower SVC and increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally possibly indicating atypical infectious
 process or mild pulmonary edema.
