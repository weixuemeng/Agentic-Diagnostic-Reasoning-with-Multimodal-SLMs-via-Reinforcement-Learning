                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hallucinations.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Views are expiratory and therefore evaluation is limited. 
 Exaggerated pulmonary vascularity may be secondary to low lung volumes,
 however, mild interstitial edema may be present.  Evaluation of heart and
 mediastinal contours is difficult on this study.  Aortic calcifications are
 seen.  Bilateral lower lung opacities likely reflect atelectasis, though
 infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is evident on this view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very limited study. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis
 and equivocal mild interstitial edema. Infection at the lung bases cannot be
 excluded on this study.
 
 Findings and limitations discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 1:10 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the
 study.
