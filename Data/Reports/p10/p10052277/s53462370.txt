                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  No acute skeletal abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No conventional radiographic evidence of interstitial lung
 disease.  However, if clinical suspicion is high, consider a high-resolution
 chest CT, as it is more sensitive than radiographs for detecting interstitial
 abnormalities.
