                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of metastatic breast cancer, now
 receiving chemotherapy, with bilateral PleurX catheters // eval for pleural
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated. Patient is status post PleurX drain placement in
 the right lung with the tip seen in the mid to upper lateral lung and catheter
 placement in the left lung with the tip terminating in the left lung base,
 stable in position since prior exam.  There is interval decrease in pleural
 effusions compared to the prior exam in ___ with small residual
 effusions present bilaterally.
 
 Irregularity of the bilateral hila and right heart border are compatible with
 known metastatic nodules and lymphadenopathy, better assessed on prior CT from
 ___.  Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged.  No new
 focal consolidation is identified.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size appears
 approximately stable compared to prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Metastatic masses and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are unchanged and better
 seen on prior CT chest from ___.
 2. Hypoinflated lungs with interval decrease in pleural effusions compared to
 prior exam in ___, with small residual effusions present bilaterally.
 3.  Bilateral PleurX drains are in stable position.
