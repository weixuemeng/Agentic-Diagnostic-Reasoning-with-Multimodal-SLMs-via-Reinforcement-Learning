                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and recent chest x-ray ___ with
 haziness around the right heart border, known metastatic breast cancer.
 Evaluate for worsening or resolution of Rt heart border haziness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Persistent opacity of the right heart border is
 most likely accounted for by known internal mammary necrotic lymph nodes and
 appears slightly larger.  Left lower lobe parenchymal opacity is unchanged. 
 There is no new pulmonary opacity.  Thickening of the left paratracheal stripe
 with narrowing and rightward deviation of the trachea is unchanged.  Left
 hilar lymphadenopathy appears grossly stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity over the heart border likely accounted for by known necrotic internal
 mammary lymph nodes could be slightly larger.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia.
