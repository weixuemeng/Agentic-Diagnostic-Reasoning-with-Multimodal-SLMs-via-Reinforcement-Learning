                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, in a patient with a history of metastatic breast cancer,
 including to the peritracheal area left greater than right.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, as well as CT chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate normal cardiac size.  The
 right heart border is somewhat obscured, without definite consolidation
 visualized.  A 3.4 cm mass projecting over the left hilum corresponds to a
 necrotic hilar mass/ lymph node which was present on CT chest from ___.
 Narrowing of the trachea and prominence of the paratracheal soft tissues with
 rightward deviation of the upper trachea appears unchanged compared to CT
 chest, allowing for differences in technique. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Narrowed trachea with increased paratracheal tissues resulting in rightward
 deviation of the upper trachea, which appears unchanged compared to CT chest
 from ___, allowing differences in technique.
 2. Obscured right heart border without definite focal consolidation.  An early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded, in the right clinical setting.
 3. A left hilar mass was present on CT from ___.  The left lower lobe
 mass is better evaluated on CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  A preliminary reading was provided, upon request, via telephone
