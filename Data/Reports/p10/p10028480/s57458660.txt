                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain for a day.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear
 except for linear left basal scarring/atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary consolidation is detected.  Mild
 prominence of the interstitial markings likely represents changes of chronic
 CHF.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, except for mildly
 tortuous thoracic aorta.  Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
