 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after clamping of the chest tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 A small left apical medial pneumothorax is unchanged.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small, unchanged and larger on the left side.  There are no
 other acute interval changes.
