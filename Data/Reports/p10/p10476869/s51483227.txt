 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for pneumothorax, CT clamped.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is a small right pneumothorax.  Left apical chest tube is in place. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis has increased.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Aside
 from right lower lobe atelectasis, the right lung is clear.  Left chest wall
 subcutaneous emphysema is grossly unchanged.  Post-operative changes in the
 left hilum are again noted, status post left upper lobe wedge resection.
