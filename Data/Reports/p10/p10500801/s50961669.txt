                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Pneumothorax status post pigtail placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  
 
 Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 ___ at 12:56.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter which
 projects over the lateral aspect of the right mid hemithorax on the frontal
 view with near-complete resolution of the previously seen pneumothorax.  There
 has been interval re-expansion of the right lung.  Hazy opacification within
 the right lung base might reflect an area of residual atelectasis.  The left
 lung remains unchanged with emphysema again noted.  Previously noted shift of
 mediastinal structures to the left has resolved.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided pigtail catheter with near complete
 resolution of the previously seen pneumothorax and re-expansion of the right
 lung.  Hazy opacity within the right lung base may reflect an area of residual
 atelectasis.  The previously seen leftward shift of mediastinal structures has
 resolved.
