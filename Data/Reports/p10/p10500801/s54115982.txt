                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent right pigtail catheter for
 pneumothorax treatment.  Pre-clinic visit examination on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities are
 identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  As shown on previous examination, there is evidence of bilateral,
 mostly basal, emphysema with rarefied vasculature, flattened diaphragms, and
 increased translucencies rather typical for bilateral basal emphysema. 
 Lateral pleural sinuses as well as the posterior sinuses are free from any
 remaining pleural effusion.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified,
 and no residual pneumothorax is seen in the right hemithorax apical area.  In
 comparison with the next preceding examination, the small right-sided pleural
 effusion has now disappeared and the same holds for some parenchymal
 infiltrates in the right upper lobe area which now have cleared.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax are grossly within normal limits with the exception
 of some minor degenerative changes in the mid portion of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normalization of chest findings in patient with previous
 right-sided spontaneous pneumothorax.  Rather marked bilateral basal
 emphysematous changes remain.
