 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Large right-sided pneumothorax is
 demonstrated with leftward shift of mediastinal structures compatible with
 tension.  The left lung is hyperinflated with evidence of emphysema.  No
 pleural effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.   The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Streaky linear opacities
 within the visualized left lung likely reflect bronchiectasis. There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right-sided pneumothorax with mild leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures indicative of tension.  Findings discussed with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ ___ phone on ___ at 2:31 p.m.
