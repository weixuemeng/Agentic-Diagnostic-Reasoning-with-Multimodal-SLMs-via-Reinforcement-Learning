                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pulling out chest
 tube.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 There is small right apical pneumothorax.  There is right upper lung opacity,
 better appreciated on the current study as compared to prior image that might
 reflect hematoma related to position of the chest tube and should be further
 observed.  No appreciable atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.  Small
 amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
