                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of COPD.  Study obtained for pre-operative
 planning.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs, the
 chest diameter is increased in AP dimension.  Lungs are clear without pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Bronchial wall thickening is most evident at lung bases.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Hyperexpanded lungs, compatible with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Bronchial wall thickening may reflect chronic or acute bronchitis.
