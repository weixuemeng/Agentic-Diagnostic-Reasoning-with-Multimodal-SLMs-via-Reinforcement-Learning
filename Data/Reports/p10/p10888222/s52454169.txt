                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with BRBPR, trach mask.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are low which
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which remains markedly
 enlarged.  Superior mediastinal widening is also likely due to low lung
 volumes, and is similar compared to the prior study.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Assessment of the left apex is
 somewhat obscured by external device.  Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Unchanged marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
