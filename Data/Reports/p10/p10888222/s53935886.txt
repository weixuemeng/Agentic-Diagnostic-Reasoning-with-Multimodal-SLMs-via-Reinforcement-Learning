                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated head bleed  // CXR: eval for tube
 placementCT: eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A transesophageal tube is
 incompletely imaged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are or widened, without
 change since recent study of less than 2 hr earlier.  Median sternotomy wires
 are well aligned and intact.  Interval worsening of left lower lobe
 atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  Minor atelectasis at right lung
 base is new.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina.
 
 Persistent widening of cardiomediastinal contours, not optimally assessed on a
 portable supine radiograph.  Although potentially due to accentuation of
 vascular structures and excessive mediastinal fat, CT may be helpful to
 exclude mediastinal hematoma or will lymphadenopathy, if warranted clinically.
