                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval development of right perihilar and right basilar
 opacities and to lesser extent left base opacity raising concern for
 multifocal pneumonia, versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen although there may be a trace left pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. 
 Calcification is seen at the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval development of right perihilar and right basilar opacities and to a
 lesser extent possible minor left base opacity which could be due to
 multifocal infection or less likely, but possible asymmetric pulmonary at the
 left, depending on the clinical scenario.
