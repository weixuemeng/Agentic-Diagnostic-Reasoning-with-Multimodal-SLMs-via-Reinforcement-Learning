                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with triple vessel disease
 after intra-aortic balloon placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 Intra-aortic balloon is placed with the tip being approximately 2 cm below the
 roof of the aortic arch.  Widespread opacities are redemonstrated, most likely
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are most
 likely present.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
