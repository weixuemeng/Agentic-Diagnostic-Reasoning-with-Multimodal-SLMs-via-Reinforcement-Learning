                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, which
 results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Within this
 limitation, there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Undulations of the right hemidiaphragm are unchanged.  The
 heart is normal in size, and the hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
