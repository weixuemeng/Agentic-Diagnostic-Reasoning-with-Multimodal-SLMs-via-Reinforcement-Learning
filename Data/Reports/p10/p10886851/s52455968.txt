                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and wekaness, pls eval for pna, pls
 perform as upright chest, had recent colonoscoypy and want to also r/o free
 air in abd  // History: ___M with fever and wekaness, pls eval for pna, pls
 perform as upright chest, had recent colonoscoypy and want to also r/o free
 air in abd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Lateral view
 is slightly suboptimal due to slight patient motion and under penetration,
 possibly due to body habitus. No pleural effusion is seen. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax. Subtle bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis
 although underlying infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. No evidence of free
 air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Subtle bibasilar opacities may be due to vascular crowding
 and/or atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
