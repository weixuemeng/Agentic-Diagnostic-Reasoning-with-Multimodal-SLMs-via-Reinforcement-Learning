                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea and malignant effusion and
 acute hypoxia, question collapse, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 11:59.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 5:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The patient's mandible obscures the left apex.  However, when compared to
 the prior study, there is increasing opacification of the right hemithorax
 with no obvious aerated lung visible on the current examination suggestive of
 an increasing effusion.  A right basilar chest tube remains in place.  Left
 lung now demonstrates linear and patchy opacity at the base with some air
 bronchograms which although could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia
 should also be considered.  The left upper and mid lung appears clear.  Given
 the patient rotation, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult
 to assess.  However, left hilar enlargement remains and most likely reflects
 lymphadenopathy.  Clinical correlation is advised.
