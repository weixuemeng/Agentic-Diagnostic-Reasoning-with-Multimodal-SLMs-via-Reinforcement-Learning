                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter courses over the right side of the chest.
 It seems to make a loop where it projects over the lower right costophrenic
 angle and then extends laterally coursing over the lateral side of the
 junction between the chest and abdomen. Its distal course is not assessed.
 There is a moderate hiatal hernia. The patient is status post sternotomy. The
 heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable. There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Streaky opacities at the lung bases, greater on the right than
 left, have decreased and suggest minor atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
