                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, concern for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low
 in volume, but appear clear with tortuous aorta redemonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette
 remains stably enlarged.  Osteopenia and bony deformity is unchanged and
 likely contributes to the diaphragmatic flattening.
