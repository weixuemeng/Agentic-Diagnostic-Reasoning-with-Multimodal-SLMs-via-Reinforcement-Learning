                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left shoulder and back pain.  Evaluate for the presence of
 mediastinal widening or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  The heart is mildly enlarged, not
 significantly changed.  Widening of the vascular pedicle is not significantly
 changed.  Hazy opacification of the mid-to-lower right lung and lower left
 lung is likely secondary to overlying soft tissue.  There is evidence of
 vascular cephalization with prominent bilateral perihilar interstitial
 markings, concerning for mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  A small pleural
 effusion at either lung base cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study secondary to patient rotation and body habitus. 
 Probable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation.
