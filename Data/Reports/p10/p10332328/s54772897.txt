                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath,
 rule out CHF exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  The patient is rotated to the right.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are enlarged, although grossly stable given
 differences in technique and patient inspiration.  Prominence of the hila
 persists, suggesting fluid overload.  There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle raising the concern for small pleural effusion.  Lateral
 views are suboptimal due to underpenetration posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient rotated to the right.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and
 fluid overload.  Possible small left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural
 effusion would be difficult to exclude.
