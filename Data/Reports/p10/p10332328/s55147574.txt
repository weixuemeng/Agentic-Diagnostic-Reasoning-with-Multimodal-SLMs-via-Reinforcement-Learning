                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with CP with point tenderness on left chest wall, evaluate
 for rib fracture or infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe kyphoscoliosis deformity is again noted.  There is atelectasis at the
 right lung base.  Left lower lobe opacity with partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia is
 also possible.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is central vascular
 congestion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Nonspecific left lower lobe opacity which may reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration, or an early focus of pneumonia.
 
 3. No acute bony fracture identified.  Dedicated rib films may be considered
 given the low sensitivity of conventional radiographs.
