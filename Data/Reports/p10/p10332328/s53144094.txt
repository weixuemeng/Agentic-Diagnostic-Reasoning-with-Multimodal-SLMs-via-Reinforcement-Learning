                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent CHF exacerbation found to have poorly
 fusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to chest radiograph dated ___, frontal and lateral
 radiographs demonstrate decreased but persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions with a fissural component on the right. There is no overt pumonary
 edema, although some vascular congestion is present.  The lungs remain grossly
 clear without focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal contour appears
 stable allowing for differences in patient positioning.  Severe kyphosis of
 thoracic spine is redemonstrated contributing to low lung volumes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
