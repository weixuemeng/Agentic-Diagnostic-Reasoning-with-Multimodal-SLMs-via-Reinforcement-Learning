                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart is again moderately enlarged.  The aorta is markedly tortuous.  The lung
 bases appear better aerated than on the prior examination, although on this
 study, there is perhaps mild upper zone re-distribution of pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension.  Pleural effusions have
 mostly or fully cleared.  There is marked kyphotic curvature with similar but
 incompletely assessed deformities at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which may suggest mild vascular congestion but generally
 improved aeration at the lung bases including substantial resolution of
 suspected pleural effusions.
