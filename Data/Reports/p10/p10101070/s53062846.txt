                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cholangitis, now with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low. There are small bilateral pleural effusions or pleural
 thickening.  Minimal left upper lobe and left basal linear opacity could
 either be from scarring or atelectasis.  There has been a prior sternotomy for
 aortic valve repair.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 Right humeral head is not included fully on this study and appears abnormally
 sclerotic.  If warranted, a dedicated shoulder radiograph could be obtained
 for further characterization.
