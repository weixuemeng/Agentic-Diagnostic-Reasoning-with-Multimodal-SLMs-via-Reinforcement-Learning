                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the
 junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava but does not
 make the expected downward turn within the SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits for technique.  The lung volumes are low.  Improved
 aeration at both lung bases with residual minor atelectasis remaining as well
 as small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
