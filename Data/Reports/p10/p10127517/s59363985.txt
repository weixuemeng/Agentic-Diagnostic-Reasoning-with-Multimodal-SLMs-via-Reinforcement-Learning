 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, following removal of the right
 chest tube there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Small amount of subcutaneous
 gas is seen along the right upper abdomen.
 There has been some decrease in the opacification at the left base with
 improved visualization of the hemidiaphragm.  On the lateral view, there is
