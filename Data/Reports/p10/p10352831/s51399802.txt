                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are numerous old left-sided rib fractures/old rib deformities again seen. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a small left
 pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 There is also old right clavicular fracture.  A left retrocardiac opacity may
 relate to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small left pleural
 effusion.  Underlying patchy left retrocardiac opacity may relate to
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 2.  Old left-sided rib fractures and right clavicle fracture.
