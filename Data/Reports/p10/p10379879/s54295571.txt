                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of an arrest like episode 3 weeks ago,
 history of deep venous thrombosis, chronic kidney disease, COPD, interstitial
 fibrosis  // Please evaluate for acute process, please evaluate for DVT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low with chronic interstitial opacities again noted along
 the periphery and lung bases with associated honeycombing and fibrosis. Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, however it is hard to
 exclude slight worsening of interstitial lung disease compared to the previous
 radiograph. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar with the heart size
 appearing mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease most likely reflective of usual interstitial
 pneumonia, better characterized on prior chest CT.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis though it is difficult to exclude slight
 interval worsening of chronic interstitial lung abnormality.
