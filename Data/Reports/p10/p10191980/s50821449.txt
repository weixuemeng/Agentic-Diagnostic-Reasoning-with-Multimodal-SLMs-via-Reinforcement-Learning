                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left hemithorax, and
 note is made of a very small left apical pneumothorax, slightly decreased in
 size from the prior radiograph.  Bibasilar opacities have improved compared to
 the previous study.  Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, not
 appreciably changed on the right, but potentially slightly smaller on the
 left.  Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent chest radiograph.
