  multiple bilateral rib fxs appear subacute.
  
  Left base opacity may represent combination of small left pleural effusion
  with overlying atelectasis, consolidation may also be present.  Difficult to
  exclude trace right pleural effusion. 
  Areas of opacity over the lung field L>R, also projects over the ribs,
  difficult to discern if osseous or pulmonary in nature. correlate with h/o
  malignancy or infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, history of CVA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, left base
 consolidation may also be present.  Overall, the lung volumes are low.  Trace
 right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Areas of opacity projecting
 over the lung fields, left greater than right, projecting over the ribs, may
 be osseous versus pulmonary in nature.  Correlate with history of malignancy
 or infection, trauma.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen, involving at least
 the left lateral ___, ___, ___, 10th rib, with evidence of some callus
 formation, indicating that they are subacute.  There is also evidence of
 callous formation along multiple lateral right-sided ribs, including the right
 lateral ___, ___, ___, ___, ___, and possibly 2nd ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left base opacity may represent combination of small left pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude trace right pleural
 effusion.  There is increased opacity projecting over the lung fields
 bilateral left greater than right, also project over the ostia
 structures/ribs, difficult to discern whether osseous in nature or pulmonary. 
 Correlate with history of malignancy or infection or trauma.  
 
 Multiple bilateral rib fractures with evidence of callous formation,
 suggesting they are subacute.
