                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMIERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 17:48.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post chest tube to waterseal,
 question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:50.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 17:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the proximal to
 mid SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 coiled within the stomach.  Interval removal of the endotracheal tube. 
 Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line.  Pleural and
 abdominal drains remain in place.  Left basilar chest tube remains in place. 
 No definite pneumothorax is seen.  Interval reduction in lung volumes with
 crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Areas of probable patchy atelectasis
 within the right lung related to the interval decrease in lung volumes.
 Multiple bilateral rib fractures again are seen.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and
 inspiration.
