                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with polytrauma, chest tube placed back to
 suction, assess for resolution of pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 536.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar chest tube remains in place.  Small left apical pneumothorax
 still persists but has decreased in size.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 projecting over the stomach.  A left subclavian central line is unchanged in
 position.  Small layering bilateral effusions are again seen and there is
 patchy bibasilar airspace disease, unchanged, most likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Multiple
 bilateral rib fractures are again seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are
 consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
