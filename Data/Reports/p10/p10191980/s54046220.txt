                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post abdominal surgery.  Assess lines/tubes and evaluate
 for pneumonia, and assess fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC.  A
 large-bore left subclavian central venous catheter ends in either the distal
 left subclavian vein or proximal left brachiocephalic vein.  An enteric
 catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the mid stomach. 
 A left pleural catheter ends at the left lung base.  Two presumed abdominal
 drains are noted over the left upper abdominal quadrant.  Multiple surgical
 clips are seen in the right upper abdominal quadrant.
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is minimal left retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Note is made of multiple bilateral old rib fractures,
 as seen on the prior radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  Minimal left retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
