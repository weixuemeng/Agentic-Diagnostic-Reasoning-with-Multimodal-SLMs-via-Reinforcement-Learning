  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
  
  Enteric tube may terminate at the GE junction, recommend advancement so that
  it is well within the stomach.
  
  Near complete opacification of the right hemi thorax with some aerated lung
  seen.  Findings concerning for large pleural effusion with overlying
  atelectasis, underlying consolidation may be present.
  
  Increased interstitial markings of the left lung may be chronic vs due to mild

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p cardiac arrest *** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // eval for tubenchct for ich
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.1 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, possibly
 terminating at the GE junction.  There is large opacity over the right hemi
 thorax with some aeration seen in the upper to mid lung.  Findings are
 concerning for large pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Underlying
 consolidation may be present.  The left lung demonstrates increased
 interstitial markings which may be chronic or due to vascular congestion/mild
 interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the right sided opacity, but is
 likely mild to moderately enlarged.  Bilateral shoulder degenerative changes
 are seen.
