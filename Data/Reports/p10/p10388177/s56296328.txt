 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatic mass, status post Whipple, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  The lung volumes
 remain low, with a partial atelectasis of the middle lobe and subsequent
 blunting of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour and parts of the right heart
 contour.  A small atelectasis is also seen at the left lung base.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
