                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hilar mass, hypoxia  // eval for ptx or pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large right hilar opacity likely corresponds to reported hilar mass. 
 Bilateral reticular opacities diffusely that bilaterally, but more prominent
 peripherally may be due to chronic interstitial lung disease, however,
 superimposed acute component is not excluded a given lack of priors for
 comparison.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There are no findings to
 suggest pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known large right hilar mass.
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally with a peripheral predominance
 suggest chronic interstitial lung disease, however, given lack of priors for
 comparison, an acute component is not excluded.
