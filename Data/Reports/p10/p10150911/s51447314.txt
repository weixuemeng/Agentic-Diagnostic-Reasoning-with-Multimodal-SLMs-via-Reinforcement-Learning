                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Overdose, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:08 at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 is slightly low in position, terminating 1.7 cm above the level of the carina.
 Enteric tube is seen terminating in the inferior hemithorax to left of
 midline, with the side port in the mid hemithorax below the level of the
 carina.  Recommend repositioning.  There is a new tubular structure projecting
 over the lower right neck, which if represents an internal jugular catheter,
 is high in position, terminating at the level of thoracic inlet.  There are
 extensive bilateral interstitial opacities, which may be due to severe edema,
 aspiration and possibly pulmonary hemorrhage.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is somewhat low in position, terminating 1.7 cm above
 level of the carina.
 2.  Enteric tube is high in position with side port in the mid hemithorax,
 distal tip in the low hemithorax above the level of the diaphragm, recommend
 repositioning.
 3.  Linear tubular structure projecting over the lower neck, if represents
 internal jugular central venous line, is high in position, at the thoracic
 inlet and above the level of the clavicles.  The above findings were discussed
 with Dr. ___ at 6:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
 4.  Extensive bilateral interstitial and possibly airspace opacities may be
 due to severe pulmonary edema, though underlying aspiration, pulmonary
 hemorrhage or even infection not excluded.
