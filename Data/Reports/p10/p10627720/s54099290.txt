                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Benzodiazepine overdose.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest radiograph outside hospital, 9:54 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm cranial to the carina in
 standard position.  An upper enteric tube terminates in the mid-to-distal
 gastric body.  Lung volumes are extremely low, exaggerating the cardiac
 silhouette and pulmonary vasculature though compared to the earlier
 examination there appears to be mild volume overload.  Heart size is likely
 normal.  Lungs are clear taking into account low lung volumes.  Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild volume overload in the background of low lung volumes. 
 Endotracheal tube and upper enteric tube in standard position.
