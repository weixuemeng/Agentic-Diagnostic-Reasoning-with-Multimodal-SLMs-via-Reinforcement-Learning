                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with arthritis, starting immunosuppression with
 MTX, assess for  TB.
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  A dense opacity projecting over
 the posterior fifth right rib warrants further evaluation with shallow
 obliques, this is likely located in the rib.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The lungs are clear.  There is pectus excavatum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of lymphadenopathy or acute TB.
 2.  Shallow obliques are recommended to further assess the opacity projecting
 in the posterior right fifth rib.
