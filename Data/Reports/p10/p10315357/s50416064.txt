                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of high thoracic chest
 wall tenderness to palpation, left posterior/axillary.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There are two to
 three punctate radiopaque densities projecting over the left axilla difficult
 to discern whether artifactual or within the soft tissue. 
 
 No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 If clinical concern for rib fracture persists, consider rib series, which is
 more sensitive.
