                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib pain after a fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A BB marker was placed over the site of pain in the lateral
 inferior right lower ribs.  No fracture is identified.  The lungs are clear
 without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No evidence of displaced rib fracture on these views. Please note that a
 dedicated rib series is a more sensitive study for the detection of a rib
 fracture.
