                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  IJ removal, to assess for PICC line.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right subclavian PICC line remains with its tip in the mid
 portion of the SVC.  Cardiac silhouette is somewhat more prominent than on the
 previous study.  It is unclear whether this merely represents a change in
 systole versus diastole, or whether the possibility of a collection of
 pericardial fluid should be considered.
 
 The large hiatal hernia is again seen.  No definite acute focal pneumonia.
