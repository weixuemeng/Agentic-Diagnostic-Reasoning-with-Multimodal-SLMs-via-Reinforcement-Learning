 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AFib, evaluation for pneumonia or chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:13 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly, but the pre-existing signs of fluid overload have
 completely resolved.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal atelectasis at the left
 lung bases.  No pneumonia.  Unchanged pacemaker position, unchanged position
 of the bilateral shoulder replacement.
