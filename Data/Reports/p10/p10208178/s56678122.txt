                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained.  The base of the
 right hemithorax is obscured by an overlying pacemaker.  The dual leads extend
 to the expected positions of the right atrium and ventricle.  The patient is
 status post bilateral shoulder arthroplasties.  A left base/retrocardiac
 opacity may represent consolidation.  There may also be a small left pleural
 effusion.  Additionally, there is a superimposed central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  The cardiomediastinal contour is enlarged, as on prior exam. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left base/retrocardiac opacity, which may represent consolidation as well
 as a small left pleural effusion.  
 
 2. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement
