                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus, intubated.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low and there is prominent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Heart size is difficult to reliably discern, however appears
 probably top-normal.  There is significant volume loss of the right hemi
 thorax.  There is moderate platelike lingular and left base atelectasis. 
 Though the right base is difficult to assess.  Endotracheal tube is in
 appropriate position.  Upper enteric tube is looped within the stomach.  There
 is a possible right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of the ETT.
 2. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and low lung volumes.  Given prominent
 volume loss the right hemi thorax, there is likely significant right base
 atelectasis and collapse of the right middle lobe with possible right-sided
 pleural effusion.  In this context, evaluation for pneumonia is difficult.
