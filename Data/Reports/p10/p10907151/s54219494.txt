                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new RIJ  // RIJ tip      RIJ tip
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs most recent ___.
 
 Right IJ line ends in the upper right atrium.  Although the upper mediastinum
 is widened, there is no leftward displacement of the trachea to raise strong
 suspicion for mediastinal hematoma.  The findings could be due instead to
 dilated mediastinal veins ended large aorta, but should be re-evaluated with
 conventional radiographs when feasible.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The base of the aerated right lung is markedly elevated.  I can't tell whether
 that is the right hemidiaphragm which was elevated to a lesser degree in ___
 or whether there is also subpulmonic right pleural effusion or even lobar
 collapse.
 Cardiac silhouette is substantially larger, due to moderate cardiomegaly
 and/or pericardial effusion and there is mild pulmonary edema in the left
 lung.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiographs, conventional if feasible, but at
 least with the patient not rotated and not supine.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 10:22 AM, 15 minutes after the initial page placed immediately up
 on discovery of the findings.
