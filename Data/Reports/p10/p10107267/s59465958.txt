                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weight loss, fevers and low CD4 count. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is a persistent opacity in the
 lingula in the region of previously identified consolidation.  It may be due
 to scarring with component of atelectasis, especially given that it is more
 conspicuous on the frontal than on the lateral view.  Linear right basilar
 opacities are also seen potentially due to atelectasis.  There is no new large
 consolidation nor effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormality detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Asymmetric left greater than right basilar opacities.  On the left it may
 represent a combination of scarring and atelectasis noting that acute
 infection is not completely excluded.  No new region of consolidation.
