 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.  Post-intubation radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph.  The ETT terminates 3 cm above the carina.  NG
 tube tip appears to be in the distal esophagus near the GE junction.  Cervical
 and lumbar spinal fusion hardware are noted.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The right heart border is irregular and
 probably reflects atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ETT terminates 3 cm above the carina.
 2.  NG tube tip is around the GE junction and can be advanced at least 5 cm
 for better position.
 3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
