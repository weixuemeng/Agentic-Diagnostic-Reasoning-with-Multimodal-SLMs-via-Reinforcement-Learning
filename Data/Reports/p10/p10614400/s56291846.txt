                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of lymphoma. Febrile neutropenia. Please
 r/o PNA.  // ___ year old man with hx of lymphoma. Febrile neutropenia. Please
 r/o PNA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating back to ___
 with the most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidations, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The hila and pleura are
 unremarkable.  There are surgical clips located in the left upper quadrant
 that are unchanged in position from previous studies.  There is moderate to
 severe thoracic scoliosis which distorts the mediastinal anatomy.  Right chest
 central venous access port catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there is no evidence of intrathoracic infection on this study, chest
 CT performed later in the day and available at the time of report approval
 shows subtle features of pneumonia, right upper lobe and bronchial
 inflammation probably due to aspiration in the left lower lobe.
