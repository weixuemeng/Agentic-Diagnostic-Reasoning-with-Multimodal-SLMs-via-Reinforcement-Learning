                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Calcification of thoracic
 aorta is noted. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are seen on
 the frontal view, but there is no clear correlate on the lateral view.  These
 bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
