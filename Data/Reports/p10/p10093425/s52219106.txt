                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular catheter.  Lung
 volumes are low but unchanged compared to the prior study.  There is improved
 aeration of the left base.  There is a small right pleural effusion with
 associated compressive atelectasis.  A rectangular opacity at the right lower
 lung is likely also due to atelectasis.  Continued attention on followup
 recommended.
