 pneumonia and hyperinflation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided single lead pacemaker is seen with its tip terminating over the
 right ventricle in appropriate position.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is normal. There is
 enlargement of the right hilum.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The
 lungs are hyperexpanded. Subtle opacity at the right base could represent
 infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Subtle right basal opacity could represent pneumonia.
 2. Enlargement of the right hilum may be due to reactive lymphadenopathy.
 Consider submitting prior images for comparison and repeat radiograph in 4
 weeks to evaluate for interval change.
