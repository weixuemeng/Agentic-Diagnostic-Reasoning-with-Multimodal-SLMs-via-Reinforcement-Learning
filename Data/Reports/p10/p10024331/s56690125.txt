 noted likely due to scarring.  There is no new consolidation, effusion or
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Trachea is deviated to the left at the thoracic inlet
 secondary to right thyroid lesion seen on prior CT.  No acute osseous or soft
 tissue abnormality.
