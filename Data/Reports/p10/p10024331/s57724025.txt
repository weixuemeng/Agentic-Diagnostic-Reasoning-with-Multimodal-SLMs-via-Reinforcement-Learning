                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Leftward deviation of the upper
 trachea is due to a right thyroid nodule and is unchanged. Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases are unchanged, and likely reflects chronic aspiration and
 scarring.  Additionally, blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus on the
 frontal view is unchanged from the prior exam and likely reflects pleural
 thickening.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No interval change from the prior exam.  No new focal opacities to suggest
 pneumonia.
