                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Bibasilar reticulonodular opacities, right greater than left, are less
 conspicuous on the right, but more prominent on the left compared to prior
 radiograph from ___, concerning for a persistent infectious process.
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged, including
 leftward deviation of the trachea at the level of the clavicular heads,
 raising suspicion for right thyroid enlargement.  There are no pleural
 effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar reticulonodular opacities, slightly decreased on the right and
 increased on the left compared to prior radiograph from ___,
 concerning for a multifocal infectious process.
 
 2.  Persistent rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of the
 clavicular heads, raising concern for right thyroid enlargement.  If not
 already performed, a non-emergent thyroid ultrasound could provide further
 information.
 
 Impression point #1 was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 3:50 p.m.
