                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 The left subclavian catheter again extends to the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is small left pleural effusion, unchanged, with no right
 pleural fluid identified.  Lung volumes remain low, with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding and basilar atelectasis.  Heart size and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is no new opacity to suggest pneumonia. 
 Vascular congestion persists, with slightly increased edema noted on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion and low lung volumes are again
 noted, with slightly worsened pulmonary edema apparent on the left.  No new
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Small left effusion.
