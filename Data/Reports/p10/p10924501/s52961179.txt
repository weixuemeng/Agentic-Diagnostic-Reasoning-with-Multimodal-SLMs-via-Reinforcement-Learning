 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___, at 8:09.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with epilepsy, new oxygen requirement,

 Comparison to ___ at 4:31.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 8:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval tracheostomy with the tip of the tracheostomy tube 4.3 cm above
 the carina.  Right subclavian central line with its tip unchanged at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.
 
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes with linear opacity at the right base likely
 reflecting subsegmental atelectasis and patchy opacity at the left base, also
 likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema or pneumothoraces.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
