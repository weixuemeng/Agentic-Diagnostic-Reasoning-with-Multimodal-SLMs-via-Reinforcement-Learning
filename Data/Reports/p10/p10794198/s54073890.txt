                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation at outside hospital
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina. An
 orogastric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach.  Heart size is top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded. Right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2. Streaky opacity in the left lung base, possibly atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.
