 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AFib, fever, question cause of chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  The lungs are
 clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs of CHF.
 
 A nodular opacity projects in the left mid lung overlapping with the left
 posterior seventh rib arch, not clearly seen on the prior exam.  Aside from
 this, no definite nodules are seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes at the right AC
 joint noted with hypertrophic changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent nodule in the left mid lung, new from prior exam
 warrants a non-emergent chest CT.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
