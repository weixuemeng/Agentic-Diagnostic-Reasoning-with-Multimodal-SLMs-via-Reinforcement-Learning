 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:07 PM
  Compared to prior study there is increased hazy opacification of the right
  upper lung traverses the given semi-upright position and suspect this is a
  layering effusion.  In addition there is also increased prominence of the
  central pulmonary vasculature which again may be positional.  New retrocardiac
  opacification, may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new tachypnea.  Evaluation for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 increased hazy opacification of the right lung which may represent a layering
 pleural effusion and has increased since the prior study from ___.
 Additionally, a left retrocardiac opacity is present, which may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Increased prominence of central pulmonary
 vasculature may be positional in nature.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right pleural effusion.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacification may be due to atelectasis, however, underlying
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
