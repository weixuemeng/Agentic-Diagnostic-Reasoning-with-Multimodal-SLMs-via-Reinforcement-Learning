                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The tracheostomy is in place with the tip being approximately 2.3 cm above the
 carina.  The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
 
 The contours of the heart are difficult to estimate due to large bilateral
 pleural effusions, right more than left associated with bibasilar atelectasis.
 The left paramediastinal opacity is unchanged and potentially might reflect
 area of atelectasis vs. infectious process.  No definitive pneumothorax is
 seen.
