                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheostomy with increasing work of breathing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to rotation. The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  A tracheostomy tube tip terminates in unchanged position.  There
 is moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Previously noted
 large right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size compared to the
 previous exam.  Small left pleural effusion is also likely present.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Slight interval decrease in size of moderate to large right pleural
 effusion.  Probable trace left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
