 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of CVA, hypertension,
 coronary artery disease, cholecystitis status post tracheostomy, now with

 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-supine
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  On the present examination, the patient is
 more rotated to the right, which explains changes in asymmetric presentation
 of the chest.  Comparison suggests that the right-sided pleural effusion has
 further progressed compromising the remaining aerated upper lobe territory
 further.  Position of tracheostomy cannula, porcine aortic valve prosthesis is
 unchanged.  The same holds for the right-sided PICC line.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right-sided pleural effusion compromising ventilation
 of remaining right lung.
