 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, extremely low lung volumes. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Due to overlapping structures
 is impossible to definitely exclude a pneumothorax on the right, though no
 suspicious finding is appreciated.  Probable continued bilateral small pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The pulmonary
 vascularity cannot be adequately assessed on this study.
