                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and hypotension, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time due to patient's EU
 critical status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact
 appearing sternal wires.  A tracheostomy is off midline to the right and small
 relative the diameter of the trachea.  There is bibasilar opacification with
 hazy opacification extending to the mid lung zones right greater than the left
 is compatible with layering pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Concurrent pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical context. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is partially obscured but appears enlarged.   A partially
 imaged drainage catheter is noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, mild pulmonary and
 mediastinal vascular congestion, and mild cardiomegaly.  
 
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis more likely than pneumonia.
 
 3.  Tracheostomy cannula may be too small and offline.  Clinical evaluation
 needed.
