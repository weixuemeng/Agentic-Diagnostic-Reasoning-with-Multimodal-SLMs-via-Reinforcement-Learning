  Right-sided pleural effusion is stable.  Assessment for underlying pneumonia
  is difficult under the effusion.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is also largely
  stable, likely there is a component of effusion there as well

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of MSSA pneumonia, now vent and
 trach dependent, systolic heart failure, and recent percutaneous
 cholecystostomy tube, presenting with fevers, chills, productive cough,
 concerning for possible pneumonia.  Assess for pneumonia in the setting of
 pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there are
 substantial bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe consolidations which
 may reflect atelectatic changes, however underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded. There are no findings suggestive of pneumonia in the ventilated
 lungs.  Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  A left PICC line remains in
 unchanged position. Sternotomy wires are midline. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe
 consolidations, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
