                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with chest pain and shortness
 of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  CT
 torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate intact sternal wires and a
 left chest wall pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and
 ventricle.  Lung volumes are slightly low, with exaggeration of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Allowing for this, the heart is top-normal in size.  Scattered
 bilateral opacities are similar in distribution compared to prior exams, and
 likely related to extensive calcified pleural plaque as seen on CT from
 ___.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
