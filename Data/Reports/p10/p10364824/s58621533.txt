                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as more recent
 chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The patient is status post sternotomy. 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and ventricle appears unchanged.  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Pleural plaques are widespread.  On this
 examination, compared to the prior radiograph, there is vague hazy opacity
 projecting over the right upper lung.  It appears similar, however, to more
 recent chest CT imaging, however, and probably less severe.  Mild superior
 endplate compression deformity of vertebral body situated at the thoracolumbar
 junction appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent asymmetric hazy opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung compared to the left, but similar to a decrease since the prior
 chest CT.  Although difficult to exclude a subtle acute process, the
 appearance is likely chronic.  If symptoms were to persist, however, then
 short-term repeat radiographs could be given consideration to exclude
 pneumonia.
