                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, sob, and wt gain  // eval pneumonia vs chf
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left chest wall pacer is seen
 with leads extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle.
 Midline sternotomy wires are noted. Extensive calcified pleural plaque as seen
 on prior CT accounts for the scattered opacities projecting over both lungs.
 Given this, a subtle nodule or consolidation is difficult to exclude though
 none is clearly seen. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is
 top-normal in size. Mediastinal contour is normal. Bony structures appear
 intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Extensive calcified pleural plaque likely the sequelae of prior asbestos
 exposure.
 2. Top normal heart size.
 3. No convincing pneumonia or CHF.
