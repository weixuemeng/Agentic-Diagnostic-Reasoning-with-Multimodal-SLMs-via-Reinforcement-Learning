  Lung volumes are improved from the prior day's radioagraph with interstitial
  abnormalities consistent with known ILD. Overall, the radiographic appearance
  of the lungs in the frontal projection is unchanged from ___ where linear
  right basal and left midlung opacities were present along with more rounded
  left basal opacities. Unfortunately today's lateral view is non-interpretable
  due to motion. However, there is no specific finding to suggest pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___ as well as chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, and accompanied by basilar predominant
 pulmonary fibrosis in keeping with known chronic interstitial lung disease. 
 No definite superimposed pneumonia is evident, but lateral view is limited by
 low lung volumes and extensive respiratory motion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged, but stable in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic basilar predominant interstitial fibrosis without
 convincing evidence of a superimposed acute infectious pneumonia.  However,
 given limitations of the current lateral view, a repeat lateral view with
 improved technique may be helpful to exclude a subtle basilar pneumonia if
 clinical suspicion for infection persists.
