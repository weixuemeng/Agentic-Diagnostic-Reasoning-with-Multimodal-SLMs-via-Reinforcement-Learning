                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and report from chest radiograph ___ (images are not available for direct comparison at this time).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is at least mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect the patient's known of fibrosing
 NSIP, as seen on the prior chest CT.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 could suggest a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of the
 patient's known fibrosing NSIP.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggests a small effusion.  Superimposed process at the lung bases is
 difficult to exclude.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
