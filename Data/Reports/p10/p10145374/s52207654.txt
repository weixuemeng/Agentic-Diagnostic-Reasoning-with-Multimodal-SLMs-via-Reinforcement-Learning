                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic
 knob.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is slightly improved aeration at
 the left lung base with residual patchy bibasilar opacities possibly
 reflecting atelectasis. No pleural effusion, new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the left lung base with residual patchy
 bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
