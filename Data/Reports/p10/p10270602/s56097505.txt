                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and body aches.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  The hilar structures and pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Soft tissue swelling is seen anterior to the
 sternomanubrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling directly over the sternum which would be
 amenable to direct physical examination.
