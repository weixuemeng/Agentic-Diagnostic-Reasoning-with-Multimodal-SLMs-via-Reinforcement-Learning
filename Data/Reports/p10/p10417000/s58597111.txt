                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG, post pull  // eval ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, multiple lines and tubes have been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar prior.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac opacity which is progressed compared with the
 prior study, now with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the right base, which is also slightly more pronounced. 
 Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles could reflect the presence of
 small effusions.  As before, there is increased opacity in both lung apices
 which may reflect pleural parenchymal scar scarring, although it appears
 somewhat more pronounced than on the preoperative film from ___ there
 is improved compared with ___.
 
 No CHF.
 
 Residual subcutaneous emphysema along the lower left chest, improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of lines and tubes.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity compared to the prior study, consistent with
 increase in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Probable small bilateral effusions.
 
 Increased opacity in the left greater right paratracheal region and at the
 lung apices, improving compared with ___.  Clinical correlation is
 requested.
