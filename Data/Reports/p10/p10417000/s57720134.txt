 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:22 PM
  
  
  ET tube 4.1 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube with the tip and side-port in
  the stomach.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter in the mid SVC. 
  Two drains projecting over the mediastinum and one over the left hemi thorax. 
  Multiple epicardial pacing leads projecting over the heart.  Extensive
  subcutaneous gas along the left chest wall.
  
  The lung apices are omitted from view.  No large pneumothorax is seen on this
  supine view.  There is likely small left pleural effusion.
  
  There is a an opacity at the left upper lobe projecting from the aorta to the
  left apex.  This is new since the study of ___ at 14:29.  It is
  unclear whether this is expected postoperative change or hemorrhage.  If there
  is any concern for postoperative bleeding CT of the chest should be obtained.
  
   The findings were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 21:30, 
  ___, ___ min after discovery.  The provider explain that the opacity
  likely reflects expected postoperative hematoma and that there was no evidence
  of active bleeding

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p takeback for mediastinal washout  // Post-op
 CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior studies including ___ at
 16:30.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung apices are not included on this study limiting observation.  There is
 no definite pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  There is subcutaneous
 emphysema on the left as on the earlier study.
 Extensive postoperative changes are present.  There is a left chest tube and
 mediastinal drains are present.  Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the
 carina.  Right central line tip is in the superior vena cava.  Nasogastric
 tube tip is in the stomach.
 There is better aeration of the left lung as compared to the earlier study. 
 There is an area of density in the left apex medially which could represent
 atelectasis, but correlation with surgical intervention that region is
 recommended.  This may be accentuated by slight patient rotation to the left.
