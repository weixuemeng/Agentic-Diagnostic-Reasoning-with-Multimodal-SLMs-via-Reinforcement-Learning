 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:13 PM
  Interval withdrawal of right central venous catheter terminating in the mid
  SVC.  Mild interval increase in bibasilar opacifications likely reflecting
  atelectasis though small concomitant effusions can't be excluded.  Otherwise
  unchanged exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post ventral hernia repair with hypertension.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 There are lower lung volumes, right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. 
 Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is obscured by the lung abnormalities
 and the low lung volumes.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.
