 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Ventral hernia, rule out pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  On the right, no pleural effusion is detected.  On the
 left, there is a small pleural effusion limited to the costophrenic sinus,
 decreasing in extent as compared to the previous examination.  However, areas
 of basal atelectasis are still seen in the retrocardiac lung regions and at
 the left lung base.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  Mild fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
