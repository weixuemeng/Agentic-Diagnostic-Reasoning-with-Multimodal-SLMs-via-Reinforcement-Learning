 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, low lung volumes, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a tracheostomy tube is in
 unchanged position.  Also unchanged is a nasogastric tube and a right-sided
 PICC line.  The lung volumes are low, but the current image shows no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
