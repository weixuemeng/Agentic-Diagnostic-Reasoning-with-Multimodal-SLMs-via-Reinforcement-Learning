                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with intubation  // ?tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ from an outside facility and
 uploaded onto PACS.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip ends approximately 6.5 cm from the carina and is too high.  An
 enteric tube tip projects over the expected region of the stomach in the left
 upper quadrant.  The side port may be at the region of the GE junction.  No
 focal consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax in the lungs.  There is
 suggestion of mild pulmonary vascular congestion, although this may be related
 to patient's somewhat supine position.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT tip is too high ending approximately 6.5 cm from the carina. 
 Recommend advancing by approximately 2-3 cm.
 
 2.  Enteric tube could be advanced 4-5 cm to ensure that the side port is also
 in the stomach.
