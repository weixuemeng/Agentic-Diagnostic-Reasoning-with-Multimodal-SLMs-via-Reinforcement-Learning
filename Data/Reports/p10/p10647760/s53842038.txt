                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post replacement of Dobbhoff.  Assess midline position
 prior to advancement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___ at
 13:59.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff tube has been advanced and projects over the expected
 location of the stomach.  The ET tube is in stable position approximately 3 cm
 above the carina.  The lungs are unchanged in appearance from approximately
 six hours prior.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and
 pleural surfaces are similarly unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax present.  The bones are markedly sclerotic, consistent with known
 metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval advancement of the Dobbhoff tube, which now projects
 over the expected location of the stomach.
