                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with persistent fevers, status post
 complicated hospital course for mesenteric ischemia, and ___ fungemia,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view
 chest examination obtained four hours earlier during the same day.  The
 patient was now brought in upright position and a PA and lateral chest image
 could be obtained.  Again, high positioned diaphragm probably related to
 abdominal process, obscured partially the heart shadow.  Significant cardiac
 enlargement is unlikely.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta without
 evidence of local contour abnormalities.  Unchanged position of previously
 described PICC line terminating in lower third of SVC.  The lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any significant fluid accumulation. 
 Again, there are bilateral thin plate atelectasis related to the high
 positioned diaphragms, but acute infiltrates of pneumonic appearance cannot be
 identified.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pneumonia in patient with history of fungemia in the
 presence of mesenteric ischemia.
