                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath

 COMPARISON:  ___.  Reference made to CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Linear left
 upper lobe opacity is seen.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is
 also ground-glass opacity in the right suprahilar region.  Ground-glass
 opacities were seen in these locations on prior chest CT from ___, at
 which time there was concern for bronchioalveolar carcinoma; difficult to
 accurately compare between the two studies given differences in technique for
 size.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
