 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Right
 paratracheal opacity likely relates to mediastinal lipomatosis and/or
 prominent vascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.
