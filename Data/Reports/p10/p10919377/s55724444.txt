                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, and HIV,
 presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity in the lingula suggests minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity most suggestive of minor atelectasis
 or scarring.  No definite evidence for acute disease.
