                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 435
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with trach, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:40 a.m.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 435 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy, nasogastric tube and right subclavian PICC line are
 unchanged in position in this patient status post median sternotomy for CABG
 with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The heart
 remains enlarged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Overall, there is increasing
 fullness of the pulmonary vasculature and slight increase in opacity in the
 right lung as compared to the left.  These findings could represent worsening
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an infectious process should also be
 considered.  There are likely small bilateral layering effusions.  A calcified
 nodule of the right lung base is consistent with a granuloma.  No
 pneumothorax.
