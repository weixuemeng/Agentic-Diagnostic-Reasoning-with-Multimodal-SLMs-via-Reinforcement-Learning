                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myopathy, ventilator-dependent.  Query trach position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Postoperative appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Hilar
 contours are normal.  There is relative horizontal orientation of the
 tracheostomy tube which is otherwise in adequate position.  Tracheal cuff
 appears to be inflated to a greater diameter than the trachea.  A calcified
 nodule at the right lung base is unchanged and corresponds to granuloma on
 prior CT.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Adequate positioning of the tracheostomy tube but with a tracheal cuff
 inflated wider than the diameter of the trachea itself.  This may represent
 overinflation of the cuff or pretracheal positioning of the cuff.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___ at
 10:44 on ___ at time of initial review.
