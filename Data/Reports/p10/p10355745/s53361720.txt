                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status with dizziness and crackles on examination.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 Numerous mediastinal clips and sternal wires denote prior cardiac surgery. 
 Chronic mild to moderate cardiomegaly is of unknown chronicity.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Linear bibasilar opacities are
 most compatible with atelectasis. Bronchial cuffing is not accompanied by any
 other findings of acute heart failure.  The central pulmonary vessels are
 normal in caliber.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Bronchial inflammation.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
