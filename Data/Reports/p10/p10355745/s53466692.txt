                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, to assess for excess fluid.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of monitoring and support devices.  Continued increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and pleural effusion. Possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly
 not be excluded.  There is also some increased opacification to a lesser
 degree at the right base.  Again, this could reflect atelectasis or be a focus
 of early consolidation.
