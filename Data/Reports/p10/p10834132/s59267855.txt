                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with unexplained weight
 loss.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  The lucency in the right upper lung most likely represents summation
 of shadows since no abnormality was demonstrated on the recent CT neck that
 has included this portion of the lung in the field of view.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
