                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Flu-like symptoms.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Ill-defined airspace opacities
 are most conspicuous in the right mid to upper lung.  Mild perihilar vascular
 congestion is noted.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Ill-defined airspace opacities, most pronounced in right
 mid-to-upper lung, may represent infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
