                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, there is a persistent veil -like opacity
 over the left hemithorax, with a crescent of air surrounding the aortic arch,
 in keeping with continued left upper lobe collapse.  Left hilum and
 mediastinum are enlarged, as seen on the prior study, compatible with
 patient's known mass with hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. There is a trace
 left pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear without pneumothorax.  Marked
 scoliosis the thoracic spine is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left upper lobe collapse, with a similar appearing large left hilar
 mass and trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax identified.
