                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung cancer and hypotension. 
 // Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from 1 day prior, PA and lateral views of the chest
 dated ___, portable view of the chest dated ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with opacity of the
 left hemithorax and elevation of the left mainstem bronchus and a stable
 Luftsichel sign, consistent with continued left upper lobe collapse although
 the volume of the collapsed lobe and the large central mass have mass have
 both decreased since ___.  Right basilar atelectasis is noted and
 there could be a small metastatic nodule.  There is no radiographic evidence
 of pneumonia, though evaluation on recent CT is more specific.  The cardiac
 silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable and unchanged since the
 prior examinations.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left upper lobe collapse without evidence of pneumonia.  Decreasing
 mass, left hilus and left upper lobe.  Possible pulmonary metastasis, right
 lower lobe.
 
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary
 embolism.
