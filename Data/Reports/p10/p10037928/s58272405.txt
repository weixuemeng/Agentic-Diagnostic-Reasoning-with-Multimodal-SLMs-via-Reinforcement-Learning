                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, and no focal consolidation is demonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is evidence of prior vertebroplasty
 within a total body at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely reflective of atelectasis.
