                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  There
 is no definite focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  An
 external marker overlies the distal left clavicle.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite fracture seen however, external marker
 projects over the distal left clavicle.  If high concern for clavicular
 fracture, suggest dedicated imaging of the clavicles.
