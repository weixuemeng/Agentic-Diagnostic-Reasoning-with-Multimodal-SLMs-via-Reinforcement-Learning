                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly, and unchanged position of pacing and ICD
 leads.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear except for linear
 opacities in the right mid and lower lung, which may reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and scarring.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
