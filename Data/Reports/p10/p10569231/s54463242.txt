                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with seizure, confusion  // r/o asp pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  The lung bases are
 underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue.  Increased opacity projecting
 over the inferior thoracic spine on the lateral view may be due to atelectasis
 although an early consolidation due to aspiration or infection is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 The lung bases are underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue.  Increased
 opacity projecting over the inferior thoracic spine on the lateral view may be
