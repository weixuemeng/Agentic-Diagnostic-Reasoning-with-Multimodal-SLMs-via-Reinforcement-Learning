                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall with intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
 hypertension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities
 within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis without focal
 consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are mild to moderate degenerative changes noted in the lower thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
