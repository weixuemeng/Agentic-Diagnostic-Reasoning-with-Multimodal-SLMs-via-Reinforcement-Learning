                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance, but there is interval
 development of multifocal opacities throughout the lungs, extensive, some of
 them confluent, some of them fairly nodular, highly concerning for interval
 development of diffuse infectious process such as septic emboli, staph aureus
 pneumonia or less likely pulmonary edema. Small amount of bilateral pleural
 effusion is most likely present.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The findings including the findings on the subsequent chest radiographs were
 discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the phone by Dr. ___ ___ at
 10:30 a.m., 15 minutes after discovering the findings.
