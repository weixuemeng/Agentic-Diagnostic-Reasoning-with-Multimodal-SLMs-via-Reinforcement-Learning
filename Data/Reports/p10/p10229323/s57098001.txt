                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation.  Cardiac silhouette has increased in size and
 is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse interstitial
 edema.  Additionally, worsening bibasilar opacities probably represent
 atelectasis in the setting of recent extubation.  Small pleural effusions are
 present, left greater than right, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
