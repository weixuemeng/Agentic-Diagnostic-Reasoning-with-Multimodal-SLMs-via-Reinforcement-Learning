 INDICATION:  History of ARDS/TRALI.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5.8 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the
 field of view.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged
 with the tip in the lower SVC.
 
 Since the prior exam, there has been improved aeration of the bilateral bases,
 particularly on the left.  No new consolidation is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement with increased aeration, particularly at the
 bilateral bases.
