                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated, assess ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid distal trachea, 2.6 cm above
 the carina, in satisfactory position.  Right IJ catheter is in unchanged
 position. Contrast is seen in the left greater than right collecting system
 from recent CT scan.  Bilateral diffuse and confluent parenchymal opacities
 are unchanged from the recent prior examination.  No clear pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours while
 obscured appear unchanged.  Spinal hardware is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of ET tube.  Unchanged appearance of
 extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with extensive multifocal
 pneumonia.
