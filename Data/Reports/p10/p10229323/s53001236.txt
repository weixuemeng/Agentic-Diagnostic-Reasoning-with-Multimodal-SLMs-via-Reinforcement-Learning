                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision, status post spinal fusion surgery, now with
 respiratory distress.  Question ARDS, transfusion reaction or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___ from earlier on the same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-erect.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a very similar pattern of a dense widespread but somewhat
 heterogeneous opacification of each lung with a nodular pattern.  Given
 opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus, a small pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude on that side.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are also stable.  A right internal jugular
 catheter again terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Spinal fusion hardware
 is incompletely characterized but unchanged.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar persistent multifocal opacities throughout each lung with
 vague nodular morphologies.  Differential considerations are broad but include
 widespread infection, including the possibility of septic emboli, versus
 developing respiratory distress syndrome, transfusion reaction, pulmonary
 edema, or hemorrhage.  Chest CT may be helpful to assess further.
