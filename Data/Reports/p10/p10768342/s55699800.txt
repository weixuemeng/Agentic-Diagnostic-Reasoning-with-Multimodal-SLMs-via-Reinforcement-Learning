                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, RIJ CVL
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  Enteric tube is present which courses into the
 stomach, with the tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Lung volumes are
 low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged. There are streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely
 reflective of atelectasis. An intravenous catheter projects over the left
 neck. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. There is marked gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Enteric tube in standard position within the stomach, however the stomach
 appears to be markedly distended with air.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
