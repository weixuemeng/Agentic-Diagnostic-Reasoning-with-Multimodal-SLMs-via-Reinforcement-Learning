 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for effusion and pneumothorax.  Status post redo
 sternotomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the sternal wires are in
 unchanged position.  Unchanged position of the clips after CABG.  The right
 internal jugular vein catheter is in constant position.  The pre-existing
 right pleural effusion now shows a predominantly intrafissural distribution,
 but the effusion has not increased in the interval.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  No evidence of pneumonia or overt pulmonary edema.
