                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, unknown last bowel movement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to lordotic positioning.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours remain unchanged.  The aorta appears unfolded with
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Previously
 noted right pleural effusion has decreased in size with only a small amount of
 pleural fluid remaining.  Trace left pleural effusion likely persists.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the left hemiabdomen and
 epigastric region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval decrease in size of small right pleural effusion with minimal left
 pleural effusion remaining.  Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar
 atelectasis.
