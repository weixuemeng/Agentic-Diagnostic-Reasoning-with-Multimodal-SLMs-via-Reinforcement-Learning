                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p dual chamber ICD  // ___ year old man s/p dual
 chamber ICD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy wires are demonstrated and unchanged.  A left-sided pacer and dual
 leads are stable.
 
 The heart is top-normal in size.  Lung volumes are low and there is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  There is mild pulmonary edema, minimally
 increased from the prior examination.  There is an increasing confluent
 opacity at the base of the right lung which could represent atelectasis or
 focal consolidation.  A trace left pleural effusion is demonstrated.  There is
 fluid seen along the horizontal fissure on the right.  No large pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly increasing edema.  Confluent opacity at the base of the right lung
 likely represents a combination of atelectasis, fluid within the horizontal
 fissure and edema however concurrent infection should be considered.  No
 pneumothorax.
