                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain.  Assess for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  New right
 lower lobe opacity is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart
 size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Right IJ CVL tip projects over the upper SVC.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for findings
 suggestive of DISH including multilevel degenerative changes, anterior flowing
 osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis with disc space narrowing.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New right lower lobe opacity potentially atelectasis given lower lung
 volumes.  Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 
 2. Right IJ CVL tip projects over the upper SVC.
