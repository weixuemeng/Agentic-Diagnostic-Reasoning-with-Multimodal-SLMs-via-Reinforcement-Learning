 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Lateral view from ___ and more recent shunt series
 from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt courses across the right side of the

 underpenetration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 is similar mild cardiomegaly.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
