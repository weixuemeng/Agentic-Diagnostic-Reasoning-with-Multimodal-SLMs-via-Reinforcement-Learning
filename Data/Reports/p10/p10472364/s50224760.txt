                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with persistent cough and shortness of breath and
 decreased breath sounds over the right mid and lower lung zones.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Hyperinflation is due either to emphysema or small airways obstruction. 
 Nipple shadows projecting over both anterior fifth rib should not be mistaken
 for lung nodules, but there may be a small nodule in the right lung at the
 intersection of the scapula and the right third anterior rib.  Shallow oblique
 views would help clarify that. 
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 central adenopathy.  The aorta is tortuous but not clearly dilated.
