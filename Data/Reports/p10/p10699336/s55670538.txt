 Hardware once again is seen overlying the lower cervical and upper thoracic

 the spinal hardware.  The left PICC line continues to have its tip in the
 azygos vein.  The position of this line has previously been communicated by
 phone to ___, the patient's nurse, on ___ at 12:14.  Incidental
 note is made of an azygos lobe.  There are small layering effusions with
 patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Overall, there is improved aeration at the right base.  No
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.  No pulmonary edema.
