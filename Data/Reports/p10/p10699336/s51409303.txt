                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with re-intubated  // intubated; interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, this is incompletely evaluated as projects
 over the surgical hardware at the cervicothoracic junction.  A left-sided PICC
 is in-situ, the tip appears to pass into azygos vein.  This is similar in
 appearance when compared to the prior study.  Posterior cervical spine
 stabilization hardware is also unchanged.  There is persistent right basal
 airspace opacities, slightly improved compared to the prior study with
 increased visualization of the right hemidiaphragm.  Unchanged left lower lobe
 atelectasis versus consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved right lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise no significant interval
 change compared to the prior study.
