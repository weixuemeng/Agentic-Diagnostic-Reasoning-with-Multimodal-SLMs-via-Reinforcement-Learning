 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 06:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hardware is again seen overlying the cervical and upper thoracic spine.  A
 left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip terminate in the azygos
 vein.  Repositioning has already been recommended on multiple prior studies. 
 A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  There is somewhat
 improved aeration at the left base with increasing streaky opacities at the
 right base suggestive of worsening atelectasis.  Incidental note is made of an
 azygos lobe.  Increased prominence of the perihilar vasculature suggests a
 component of superimposed edema at this time.  No pneumothorax.
