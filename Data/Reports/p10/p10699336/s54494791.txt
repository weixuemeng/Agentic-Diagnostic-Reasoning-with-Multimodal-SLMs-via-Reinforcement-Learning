                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MCC, arrest x 2 w/ ROSC, s/p cric w/ TBI, C5-___ fxs with
 vert dissection, T3 vertebral fx, mediastinal hematoma, R ___, ___ and L ___
 rib fxs, b/l hemothoraces, R orbital frx, R zygomatic frx s/p C3-T4 fusion
 (___) s/p trach (___) and peg (___) now s/p R craniotomy for decompression
 of SDH.  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive posterior spinal stabilization hardware in-situ,
 incompletely visualized.  This partially obscures the tracheostomy tube which
 is grossly unchanged in position.  A left-sided PICC terminates in the azygos
 vein as seen on multiple prior studies.
 
 There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and a hazy opacity at the
 right lung base likely reflecting layering of a pleural effusion which is
 increased compared to the prior study.  There is also a right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may reflect a degree of
 fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable increase in the right pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis.
 
 The left-sided PICC terminates in the azygos vein, unchanged compared to
 multiple prior studies.
