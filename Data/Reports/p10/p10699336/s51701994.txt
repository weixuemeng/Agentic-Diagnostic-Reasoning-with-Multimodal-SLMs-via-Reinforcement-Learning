 Previous asymmetric pulmonary edema has cleared and mediastinal venous
 engorgement has resolved.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis increased on the left,
 stable on the right.  Pleural effusions small if any.  No pneumothorax.  ET
 tube is in standard placement, though it is noted that the diameter of the
 tube is less than half the tracheal lumen.  Esophageal drainage tube is looped
 in the hypopharynx before passing below the diaphragm, and should be
 repositioned.  Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC.

 before passing below the diaphragm, and should be repositioned.
