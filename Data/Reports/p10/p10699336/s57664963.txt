 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mcc with recent respiratory failure  //
 serial exams
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to distal SVC.  The patient is
 somewhat rotated on today's study which limits assessment of the
 cardiomediastinal contour however this appears grossly unchanged.  There has
 been improvement in the right basilar atelectasis, there is persistent left
 lower lobe collapse.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The
 remainder of visualized lungs appear grossly clear.  Surgical hardware in the
 cervical and thoracic spine is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
