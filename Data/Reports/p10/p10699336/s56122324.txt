                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with C5 fracture, trach-dependent, persistent
 desaturations to low 80s.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy is in place.  The tip of the right-sided PICC line is not
 well visualized, but is likely unchanged in vascular level, overlying the
 distal SVC/ RA junction.
 
 There is improved visualization of the right lung base, likely reflecting 
 significant improvement in a previously seen right pleural effusion.  Some
 residual atelectasis is noted at the right lung base.  A small to moderate
 left effusion with underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
 remains present, slightly improved.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 vascular plethora, probably similar to the prior study.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is better defined on the right and there appears to be some
 leftward shift of the mediastinum, consistent with left-sided volume loss.
 
 Cervical fixation hardware is again noted.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improvement in right-sided effusion.  Residual right base atelectasis
 noted.
 2. Small to moderate left effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation may be minimally improved.
 3. Probable leftward shift of the mediastinum consistent with left-sided
 volume loss.  This may have increased in the interim, based on subtle change
 in the course of the PICC line.
 4. CHF is grossly unchanged.
