                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 16:18
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with purulent sinusitis, complicated by phlegmon. 
 Evaluate for mediastinitis and left upper lung nodule.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.  Comparison is made to selected
 images of a neck CT dated ___ which was notable for a 6mm vague nodule in
 the posterior upper left lobe for which follow up chest CT was recommended.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 16:18 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pleural effusions or focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The lungs are well inflated and clear. 
 No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.  Several more focal nodular
 opacities in the left lower lung are felt to most likely represent vessels on
 end.  No discrete nodule is seen in the left upper lobe.  Follow up chest CT
 as recommended per the report of the neck CT performed on ___ is advised.
