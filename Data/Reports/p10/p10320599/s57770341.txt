  1. Interval placement of right-sided chest tube in grossly appropriate
  location.  Hazy opacity in the right mid lung and new surgical chain sutures
  likely relates to recent right upper lobe wedge resection.
  2. Prominence of the mediastinum likely relates to rightward patient rotation
  and AP technique, not appreciably changed since earlier same day chest
  radiograph.
  3. Low lung volumes.  More apparent left basilar and retrocardiac opacity may
  relate to atelectasis.
  4. Right chest wall mild subcutaneous emphysema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p open RUL wedge  // eval for PTX, chest tube
 placement      eval for PTX, chest tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a right chest tube without definite pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas is seen
 along the right lateral chest wall with extension into the neck.  Postsurgical
 changes are seen in the right hemithorax, especially in the mid zone. 
 Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower
 lobe and probable small effusion.  There is again enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
