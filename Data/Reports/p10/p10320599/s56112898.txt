                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic lung cancer to rule out increased
 pleural effusion  // ___ year old man with metastatic lung cancer to rule out
 increased pleural effusion    ___ year old man with metastatic lung cancer to
 rule out increased pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 degree of right pleural effusion.  The nodular thickening along the mid and
 upper pleural surface appears slightly more prominent, but some of this could
 represent merely differences in position.  Surgical change sutures again are
 seen over the right upper lung, with associated soft tissue better
 characterized as recurrent disease on a previous PET scan.
 The left lung appears essentially clear.
