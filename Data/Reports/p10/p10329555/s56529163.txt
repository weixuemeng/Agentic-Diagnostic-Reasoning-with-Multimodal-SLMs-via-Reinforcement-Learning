                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever with hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is re-demonstration of a left upper hilar mass with
 associated confluent opacification of the left upper lobe, suggestive of
 collapse, as seen on the prior chest CT from ___ and the preceding
 chest radiograph from ___.  The lower aspect of the left lung and
 the entirety of the right lung are essentially clear.  The heart size is top
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A 7 mm
 sclerotic focus in the right humeral head was not seen on the prior CT from
 ___, nonspecific in nature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Similar appearance of left hilar mass with associated left upper lobe
 collapse.
 
 3.  New 7 mm sclerotic focus in the right humeral head.  Dedicated right
 shoulder radiographs are recommended for further assessment.
