                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with dyspnea on exertion and known left upper lobe
 collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again evidence of a
 hilar mass with associated left upper lobe collapse.  The area of the humeral
 head where there was a sclerotic focus previously is not definitely evaluated
 on this study.  Shift of the mediastinum is seen towards the left.  The right
 lung is essentially clear, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.  A
 nodular opacification at the left base represents prominent nipple shadow.
