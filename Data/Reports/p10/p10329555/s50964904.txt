                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational
 abnormality is identified.  The aortic arch is obliterated by a very large
 left upper lobe pulmonary mass that obliterates practically the entire upper
 hemithorax above the hilar region.  Hilar structures prominence is suspicious
 for extension into vessels.  Local pleural densities are observed along the
 entire left lateral chest wall, and the lower left lateral pleural sinus is
 mildly blunted.  The lateral view confirms the lesion and identifies its
 location mostly in the anterior apical chest.  The right-sided hemithorax
 remains normal with no pulmonary abnormalities and free pleural spaces. 
 Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of large lung mass in left upper half of
 thorax.
