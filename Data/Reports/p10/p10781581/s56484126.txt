                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with resolved pneumothorax with chest
 tube in place, for third followup chest examination with left upper lobe
 pigtail chest tube in place, status post fiducial placement.  Questionable
 pneumothorax.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained three hours earlier during the same day.  During the
 interval, a small caliber pigtail end catheter has been introduced through the
 lower lateral chest wall, projects on the single view examination to terminate
 in the mid portion of the hemithorax projecting just slightly above the left
 hilum.  The usual circular tail of the catheter has been stretched and
 elongated.  The position of the fiducious marker is unaltered and there is no
 evidence of any new pneumothorax.
