                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen suggesting
 pulmonary edema, which is new since last month's exam.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is somewhat accentuated by lower lung volumes on today's study and
 is slightly enlarged but given lower lung volumes and rotation to the left,
 there is no definite significant change.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted
 at the aortic arch.  Old anterior right rib fractures are noted involving the
 sixth and seventh ribs.  Right shoulder arthroplasty changes are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, without definite focal
 consolidation.
