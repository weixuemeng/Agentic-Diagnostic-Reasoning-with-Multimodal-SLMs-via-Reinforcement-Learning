                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated transfer  // evaluate intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, supine, AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to outside radiograph ___ at 06:41
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Increased interstitial prominence is most consistent with mild interstitial
 edema, less likely an atypical infection.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post intubation with ETT 3.1 cm above the carina.  Interval development
 of mild interstitial edema, less likely atypical infection.  Clinical
 correlation recommended.
