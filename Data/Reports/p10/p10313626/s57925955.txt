                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea and hypoxia  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique and positioning, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably stable. Lungs are symmetrically expanded and mild
 pulmonary interstitial edema is unchanged. Slightly increased opacification at
 the left base may represent atelectasis.  There is no large effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary interstitial edema, as before.  Probable left basilar
 atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation
 is recommended.
