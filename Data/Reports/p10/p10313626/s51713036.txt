  1. Focal opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine could reflect a
  focus of pneumonia.
  2. Low lung volumes with vascular crowding with probable mild pulmonary edema.
  3. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob and cough  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  CTA
 chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with vascular crowding.  A focal opacity projecting over
 the lower thoracic spine on the lateral projection could reflect pneumonia. 
 Increased perihilar interstitial opacities bilaterally suggest mild pulmonary
 edema.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine could reflect a
 focus of atalectasis or pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to resolution.
 2. Low lung volumes and probable mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
