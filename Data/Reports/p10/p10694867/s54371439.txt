                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided numbness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a small nodular density projecting over the left lower lung, probably
 due to scarring or potentially a nipple shadow, but a true pulmonary nodule is
 not excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Nodular focus projecting over the
 left lower lung.  When clinically appropriate, a chest CT is suggested to
 evaluate further.
