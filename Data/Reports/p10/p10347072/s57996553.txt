                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 inspiration and subsequently increased lung volumes with better ventilation of
 the lung parenchyma.  Currently, there is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema, or other acute lung changes.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Unchanged deviation of the upper trachea,
 potentially caused by an enlarged thyroid.
