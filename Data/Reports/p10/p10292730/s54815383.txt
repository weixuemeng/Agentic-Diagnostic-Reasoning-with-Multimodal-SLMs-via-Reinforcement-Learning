                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for minimal bibasal interstitial opacities, seen already on the
 prior CT abdomen, that potentially might reflect interstitial lung disease
 with no substantial change since the prior study.  If clinically warranted,
 correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.  
 
 Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications are suspected on the
 lateral view and might be addressed as well.
