                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w hemopneumothorax, pigtal fell out when
 sitting up  // ? pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior chest x-ray, the left pigtail catheter is no longer
 visualized.  No convincing pneumothorax is identified.  Again seen are
 fractures along the left chest wall. Linear opacity seen adjacent to the left
 chest wall in left mid lung, related to the original site of the catheter, is
 again noted.  There is faint, somewhat rounded opacity in this area which is
 new and could reflect some local contusion or hemorrhage, measuring roughly
 ___.6 mm in diameter.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted.  The hazy component previously seen at
 the right base is less pronounced.
 
 No CHF or frank consolidation is identified.  Minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.  Probable background COPD.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 New linear wirelike density likely represents an epidural catheter.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left pigtail catheter no longer visualized.  No pneumothorax detected.
 2. New focal somewhat rounded opacity in the left mid chest laterally -- 
 question new hemorrhage or contusion at the previous site of the catheter. 
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 3. New epidural catheter noted --___ correlation is requested.
 4. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
