                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p fall with multiple left rib fractures, hemo-pneumothorax
 s/p pigtail. assess interval change  // ___F s/p fall with multiple left rib
 fractures, hemo-pneumothorax s/p pigtail. assess interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 20 0 4
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 The tip of the left chest tube is slightly different in position, now lying
 along the inner surface of the left chest wall, near the site of chest rib
 fractures.  The small focus of atelectasis in left mid lung persists, slightly
 more linear at this time.  No definite pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal
 atelectasis in the left costophrenic angle is new.  There is probably also
 mild atelectasis at the right base accounting for a faint opacity there.  No
 CHF or frank consolidation.  No right effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, allowing for differences in positioning.
 
 Multiple rib fractures are again noted, best depicted on the ___ CT
 scan.
 
 Incidental note made of an old healed right proximal humeral fracture, with
 soft tissue fixation anchor over the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight change in position of left chest tube, with tip now along inner
 surface of left mid chest wall.  Question slight interval retraction.  No
 pneumothorax identified.
 2. Faint opacity right base, question atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis at
 left costophrenic angle and in the left mid zone.  Otherwise, no acute
 pulmonary process identified.
 3. Multiple rib fractures again noted.
