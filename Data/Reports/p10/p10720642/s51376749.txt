 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or mildly
 enlarged.  No definite vascular congestion, though there are bilateral small
 pleural effusions with basilar atelectatic changes.
 
 There is sclerosis in the proximal humeral shaft on the left.  This probably
 represents an old healed bone infarct.  A shoulder series could be obtained to
 better characterize this process.
