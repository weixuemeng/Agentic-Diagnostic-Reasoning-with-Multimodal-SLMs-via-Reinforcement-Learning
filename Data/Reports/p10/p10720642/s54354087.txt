                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumothorax with chest
 tube clamped
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies proximal SVC.  Mediastinal drain and left
 chest tube noted.
 
 No obvious pneumothorax.  Possibility of a tiny left apical pneumothorax is
 difficult to X completely exclude.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with sternotomy wires noted.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity is similar to prior.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is again noted.
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis the right cardiophrenic region is improved.
 
 A cerclage wire overlies the overlap point of the left clavicle and left
 scapular spine.  At the edge of these films, there is increased density in the
 left proximal humerus likely representing chondroid calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No obvious pneumothorax, though a tiny left apical pneumothorax would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.  Upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF again noted.
 
 Left base opacity essentially unchanged.  Slight interval improvement in
 cardiophrenic angle atelectasis.
 
 Chondroid calcifications noted in the visualized portion of the left proximal
 humerus, though the lesion extends beyond the edge of these films.  Though not
 fully evaluated, the appearance is suggestive of a chondroid lesion such as an
 enchondroma.  Recommend further assessment with dedicated left humerus
 radiographs, though this can be pursued when the patient is stable.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend further assessment with dedicated left humerus
 radiographs, though this can be pursued when the patient is stable.
