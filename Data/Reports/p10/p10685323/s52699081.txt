                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is calcified.  Otherwise, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Crowding of posterior lung volumes suggests minor volume
 loss in dependent areas, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
