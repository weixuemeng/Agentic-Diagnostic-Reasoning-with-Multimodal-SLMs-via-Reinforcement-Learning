                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  For seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent blunting of the costophrenic angles and possible minimal pleural
 thickening bilaterally, which is unchanged in appearance since the prior
 study.  Chain sutures are again seen overlying the right mid-to-lower
 hemithorax.  Slight upper lobe patchy opacity are seen which could be due to
 aspiration or infection and are of indeterminate acuity.  No pleural effusion
 is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Surgical clips are partially seen in the upper
 abdomen.
