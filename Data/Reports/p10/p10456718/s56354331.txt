 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Apparent increase in right pleural
 effusion, moderate in size with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis.  Small
 left pleural effusion also appears slightly more prominent, but differences in
 patient positioning could potentially contribute to the apparent change in the
 pleural effusions.
