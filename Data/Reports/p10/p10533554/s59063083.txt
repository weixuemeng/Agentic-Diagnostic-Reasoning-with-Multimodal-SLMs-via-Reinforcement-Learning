                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma and history of effusions  //
 Assess for abnormalities.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the radiograph obtained ___, there has been interval
 improvement in a right pleural effusion, which is now small if any.  There has
 also been interval resolution of right lower lung atelectasis.  There is
 persistent, benign pleural thickening at the lateral right lower lung.  Lungs
 are otherwise fully expanded and clear without consolidations.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged without pulmonary vascular congestion, pulmonary
 edema, or pleural effusions.  The descending aorta is tortuous. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are otherwise normal.  A left-sided
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates within the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pleural effusions if any. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
