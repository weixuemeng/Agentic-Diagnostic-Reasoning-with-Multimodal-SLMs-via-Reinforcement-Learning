                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate-to-large right basilar opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm and likely due to large pleural effusion.  Underlying
 consolidation is also possible. Position of the left-sided central line with
 tip in the region of the mid SVC.  There is likely some shift of the
 mediastinal structures to the left.  There is also shift of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet to the left as well.  The left lung is grossly clear noting
 some limitation due to motion.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right basilar opacity compatible with large pleural
 effusion causing some degree of mediastinal shift to the left.  Underlying
 atelectasis and possible consolidation in the right lung.
