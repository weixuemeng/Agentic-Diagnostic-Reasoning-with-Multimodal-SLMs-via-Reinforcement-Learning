                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (APAND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fatigue  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left subclavian central
 venous catheter is again seen with its tip located in the mid SVC region. The
 lung volumes are low with reticulonodular opacities noted diffusely within
 both lungs which could represent worsening edema versus a superimposed
 pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion persists with loculated fluid along
 the right major fissure, appearing minimally increased. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema possibly with superimposed pneumonia. Small pleural effusion
 on the right, appears mildly increased.  Followup to resolution.
