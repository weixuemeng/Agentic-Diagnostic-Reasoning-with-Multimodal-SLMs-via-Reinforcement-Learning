                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma with recurrent pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left pleural effusion has
 decreased and the hemidiaphragm and descending aorta are quite sharply seen. 
 On the right, there is little overall change in the relatively small effusion
 with basilar atelectasis and partial eventration of the hemidiaphragm.
 
 The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
