                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old female with chylothorax and witnessed aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, the two components of right pleural effusion, fissural and
 posterior have coalesced posteriorly, undrained despite the right
 inferoposterior pleural drainage tube.  Pneumothorax is tiny if present at
 all, of no clinical significance.  There is still consolidation at the base of
 the right lung.  Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis, I cannot tell, but
 it is more severe today than it was on ___.  Left lung is clear and
 there is no appreciable left pleural abnormality.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable, as is the generally large thoracic aorta.  Left subclavian line ends
 in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Right PICC line has been
 withdrawn from the SVC to the right brachiocephalic vein before the origin of
 the SVC.
