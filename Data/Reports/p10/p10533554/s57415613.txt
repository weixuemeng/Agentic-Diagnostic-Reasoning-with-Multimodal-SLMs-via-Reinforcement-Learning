                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT of ___ and abdominal CT of ___
 as well as a portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Heart size is upper limits of normal.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, with adjacent basilar lung opacities, which probably
 represent atelectasis.  Additional linear opacity is seen in the region of the
 minor fissure and may reflect a small amount of intrafissural fluid with
 adjacent linear atelectasis.  Left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in
 the lower superior vena cava.  Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new compared to cross-sectional
 imaging studies of ___.  Adjacent basilar lung opacities likely
 represent atelectasis.
 
 2.  No definite CHF, but repeat radiograph with improved lung volumes may be
 helpful to more fully evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.
