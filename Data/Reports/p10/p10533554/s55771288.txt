                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y.o. F ___ speaking with multiple medical issues most
 notable for HTN, CAD, Afib not on anticoagulation, systolic CHF (LVEF ___%),
 and diffuse large B cell lymphoma on Rituximab presents with cough and
 dyspnea.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, unchanged from prior.  Heterogeneous, asymmetrically
 distributed opacities remain more severe on the right than the left and show
 interval improvement, particularly in the left lungCardiomegaly is
 unchanged.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no
 evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.Left
 subclavian port tip terminates in the upper SVC, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving heterogeneous lung opacities.  Rapid change suggests pulmonary
 edema, though underlying pneumonia in the right lung should be considered in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
