                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval development of a significant increase in
 opacity projecting over the right hemithorax worrisome for worsening
 loculated/multiloculated pleural effusion with possible areas of underlying
 consolidation.  The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well
 assessed due to the adjacent opacity at the cardiac silhouette is grossly
 stable and mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Again seen
 is a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter terminating in the region
 of the low SVC.  Surgical clips are again seen projecting over the posterior
 lower mediastinum.  There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval significant increase in opacity projecting over the
 right hemithorax worrisome for worsen loculated/multiloculated pleural
 effusion with possible areas of consolidation.  Possible trace left pleural
 effusion.
