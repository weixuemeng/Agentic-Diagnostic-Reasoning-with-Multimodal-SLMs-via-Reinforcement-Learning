                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with DLBCL and recurrent right effusion s/p thoracocentesis.
 Pneumothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent performed 4 hr
 earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the radiograph from ___ there is worsening hilar engorgement
 and pulmonary vascular dilatation consistent with congestive heart failure.
 Right lower lung opacities represent a combination of pleural thickening,
 post-pleurodesis changes, small effusion and right middle and lower lobe
 atelectasis. No new focal opacities are seen. Bilateral post-radiation
 fibrotic changes are better characterized on prior CT from ___. The
 cardiac silhouette is stable. A left subclavian line terminates in the distal
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Findings of vascular congestion are similar to earlier radiograph. No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 2. Right lower lung opacities represent a combination of pleural thickening,
 post-pleurodesis changes, small effusion and right middle and lower lobe
 atelectasis.
