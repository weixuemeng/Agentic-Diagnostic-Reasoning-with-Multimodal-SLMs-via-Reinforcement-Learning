                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. The
 heart size remains moderately enlarged. Numerous clips are seen projecting
 over the left lower hemi thorax. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Moderate
 pulmonary edema persists, perhaps minimally improved in the interval. Small
 right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval with
 similar small right pleural effusion.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded.
