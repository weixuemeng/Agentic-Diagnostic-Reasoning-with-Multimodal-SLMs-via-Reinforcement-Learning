 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been an

 unremarkable without focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. 
 There is stable, mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 left-sided central venous line remains in an unchanged position, seen
 terminating in the lower SVC.
