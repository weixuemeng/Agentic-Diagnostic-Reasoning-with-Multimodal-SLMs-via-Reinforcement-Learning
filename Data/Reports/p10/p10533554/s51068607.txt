 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chylothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube
 remains in place.  The left and right central venous access lines are also in
 place.  Although the frontal radiograph shows a minimal decrease in extent of
 the pleural fluid, lateral radiographs still reveal a small amount of
 intrafissural and dorsal fluid.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No
 intraparenchymal changes.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
