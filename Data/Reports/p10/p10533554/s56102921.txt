                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with interval
 increase in size of a small right apical pneumothorax, with apical visceral
 pleural line just below the right third posterior rib level.  Right pleural
 effusion has further decreased in size with small residual effusion remaining.
 Nonspecific right lower lobe opacities, possibly representing reexpansion
 pulmonary edema, show further interval improvement.  Left lung remains clear,
 and there is no evidence of left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing small right apical pneumothorax with pleural catheter
 in place.  Small residual right pleural effusion and improving adjacent right
 lower lobe opacities, possibly representing reexpansion pulmonary edema in the
 setting of recent history of large volume thoracentesis.
