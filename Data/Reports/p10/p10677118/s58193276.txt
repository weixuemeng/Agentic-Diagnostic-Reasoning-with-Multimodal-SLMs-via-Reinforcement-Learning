                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is 6.4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  Right internal jugular is within the distal
 superior vena cava.
 
 The dense consolidation within the lingula appears unchanged.  Further
 aeration of the left upper lobe likely reflects resolving edema and mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema persists.  The bilateral small pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improving aeration of the left upper lobe more likely reflects
 minimal improvement in pulmonary edema.
