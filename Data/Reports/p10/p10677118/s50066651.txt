                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End stage renal disease and dialysis with recent desaturations. 
 Assess for worsening pneumonia or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  Chest radiographs ___, ___
 13 minutes ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased from prior with a
 greater degree of atelectasis seen in the retrocardiac space.  The dense
 consolidation within the lingula and left upper lobe is unchanged.  Mildly
 enlarged heart is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours and right hilus are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 Mediastinal clips, sternotomy wires, cholecystectomy clips and splenic
 calcifications are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
 with increased atelectasis.  
 2. Unchanged left lung opacity consistent with pneumonia.
