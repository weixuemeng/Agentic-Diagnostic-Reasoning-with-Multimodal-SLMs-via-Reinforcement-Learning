                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML // Unable to draw blood from central
 line. Assess placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Fluoroscopic images obtained ___, as well as portable AP
 chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the radiograph obtained ___, the right subclavian line has
 been discontinued. In the interim, there has been placement of a tunneled
 right subclavian central line whose distal tip projects over the mid SVC.
 There is a significant kink in the catheter projecting just over the superior
 border of the right anterior second rib, which may be contributing to
 malfunctioning of the catheter ; however, this is not well visualized on the
 lateral projection which limits localization. There are no additional
 abnormalities noted in catheter.
 
 There is mild degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine with
 multi-level osteophytes. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable in
 appearance. The bilateral hila are normal. The previously seen left
 hemidiaphragm elevation is not seen on the current study.
 
 There are no focal lung consolidations.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right tunneled subclavian central line with distal tip projecting over mid
 SVC, however with significant kink in the course of catheter. Otherwise no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
