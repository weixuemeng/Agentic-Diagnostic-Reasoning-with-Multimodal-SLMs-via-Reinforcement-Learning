                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  No new areas
 of consolidation are identified to suggest a source of infection.  Left
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated, and there is a questionable small left pleural
 effusion, which could be confirmed or excluded by either a lateral chest
 radiograph or lateral decubitus view if warranted clinically.
