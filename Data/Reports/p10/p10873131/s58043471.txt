 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are noted.  There is perihilar haziness with vascular
 indistinctness and increased interstitial markings compatible with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely
 parotid present.  There is no focal consolidation.  Lungs appear hyperinflated
 with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of underlying COPD. No

 without acute abnormality noted.
