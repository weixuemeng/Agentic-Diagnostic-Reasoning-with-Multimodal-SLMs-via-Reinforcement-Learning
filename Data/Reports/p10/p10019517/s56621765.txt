 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent fall and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Prior left basilar opacity is
 no longer visualized.  Relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged.  The lungs are clear of consolidation.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle on the left is compatible with trace effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Mid thoracic dextroscoliosis is again
 noted.  Surgical clips project over the right axilla.  Posterior lumbar
 fixation hardware is also seen.  Incidentally noted is a cervical rib on the
 right.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace left effusion.  No other acute cardiopulmonary process.
