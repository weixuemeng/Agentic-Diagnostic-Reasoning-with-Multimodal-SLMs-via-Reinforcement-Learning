                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A linear
 opacity overlying the right third anterior rib is unchanged since the prior
 study and a small dense nodular opacity overlying the left third anterior rib
 is also unchanged.  It is uncertain whether these represent sclerotic benign
 bone island on the ribs or focal scarring and calcified granuloma in the upper
 lobes of the lungs, respectively.  In either case, these are benign findings
 requiring no further evaluation.  No new areas of opacity are identified
 within the lungs, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with no evidence of
 pneumonia.
