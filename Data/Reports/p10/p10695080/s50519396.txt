                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of renal cell carcinoma and altered
 mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___; CTA chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Nodularity throughout both lungs more
 prominent on the right lung likely represents disseminated carcinoma as
 documented by the CT torso of ___.   Opacification of the left lung
 base may represent moderate left pleural effusion with compressive
 atelectasis, however underlying infectious process or mass cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  In addition to the
 disseminated carcinoma there appears to be mild volume overload or worsening
 neoplastic process within the right lung. A left Port-A-Cath tip projects at
 the level of the cavoatrial junction.
