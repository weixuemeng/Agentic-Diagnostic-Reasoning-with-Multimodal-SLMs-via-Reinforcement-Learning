                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung
 volumes are lower compared with the prior study, accentuating the pulmonary
 vasculature and increasing bibasilar atelectasis.  There is mild peribronchial
 cuffing, but no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  No effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature and
 bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
