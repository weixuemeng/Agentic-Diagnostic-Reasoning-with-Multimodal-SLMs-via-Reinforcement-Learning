                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with lateral posterior right thoracic chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 mildly unfolded.  The hilar contours are unremarkable, and the pulmonary
 vascularity is within normal limits.  Streaky linear opacities are noted at
 both lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No displaced rib
 fractures visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture identified, however, if there is
 continued clinical concern, a dedicated rib series could be obtained. 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
