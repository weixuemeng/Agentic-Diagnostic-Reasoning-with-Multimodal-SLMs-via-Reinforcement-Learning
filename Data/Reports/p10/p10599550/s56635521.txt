                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dry cough for six-week, history of latent TB, previously
 treated, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated, though clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The hyperinflation with flattened diaphragms suggests COPD. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with unfolded thoracic aorta.  Bony
 structures are intact with degenerative mild spurring in the mid-to-lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without superimposed pneumonia.
