                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with vomiting after eating
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear but hyperexpanded, with increased AP diameter. No evidence
 of hiatal hernia. Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. In the partially
 visualized upper abdomen, only on the lateral view, 2 air-fluid levels are
 seen, presumably within bowel. Abdominal plain films are recommended for
 further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Partially visualized air-fluid levels on the
 lateral view warrants further evaluation via abdominal plain films.
