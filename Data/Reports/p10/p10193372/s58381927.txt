                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement, possibly
 coronary bypass grafting.  Heart is normal size, pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable.  Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is unchanged and most
 likely chronic.  There is no pleural effusion.  There has been no change in
 the aortic contour to suggest an acute aortic syndrome, although there is
 thick calcified plaque in the knob and calcifications extend to the origin of
 head and neck vessels, seen best on the lateral view.  There are no findings
 to suggest pneumonia.
