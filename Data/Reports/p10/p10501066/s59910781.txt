 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess chest tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 4 hours earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is new compared to prior study.  ET tube is
 in the standard position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Bilateral chest
 tubes are in place with a new 3erd chest tube on the right.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Cardiac size is obscured by the pleural
 effusions. There are bibasilar opacities larger on the right side likely
 atelectasis.
