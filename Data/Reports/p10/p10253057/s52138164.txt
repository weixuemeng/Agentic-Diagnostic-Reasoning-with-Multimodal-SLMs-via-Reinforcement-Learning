                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, on peritoneal dialysis, assess for
 pleural effusion, infection, or cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Gas previously seen
 below the right hemidiaphragm is conspicuous and likely reflects the presence
 of a dialysis catheter.  There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema with small
 left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. 
 No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion.
