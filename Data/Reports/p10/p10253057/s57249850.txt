                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with end-stage renal disease.  Patient
 admitted for hypoxia and dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is a left retrocardiac
 opacity and left-sided pleural effusion, which have increased since the prior
 study.  There are also increased areas of consolidation in the left upper
 lobe.  These may represent asymmetric edema versus developing pneumonia.  The
 right lung is relatively clear.
