                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with foot infection, status post
 debridement, spiking fevers, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 3:53.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  Increasing patchy opacity at the left base which
 could reflect increasing atelectasis in the setting of a chronic pleural
 effusion, although an acute infectious process or aspiration should also be
 considered.  Linear lucency in the region of the left lateral hemidiaphragm is
 felt to represent aerated lung rather than free intraperitoneal air.  There is
 some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be
 considered.
