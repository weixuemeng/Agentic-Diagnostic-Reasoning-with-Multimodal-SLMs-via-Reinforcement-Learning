                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  There is a
 large left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  There is diffuse
 bilateral hilar interstitial opacity.  An asymmetric opacity is seen in the
 central left upper lobe.  Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips and right
 lung chain suture are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left and moderate right effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion
 suggest moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
 2.  Asymmetric opacity in the central left upper lobe has somewhat of a
 "butterfly" appearance of pulmonary edema.  However, given the unilateral
 distribution, the presence of an additional consolidation or mass is likely. 
 Repeat radiographs should be taken after diuresis.  Cross sectional imaging
 may be considered at that point if the diagnosis remains in doubt.
