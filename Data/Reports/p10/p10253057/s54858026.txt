                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease status post transplant, with diabetes
 mellitus type 2, now with shortness of breath, dry cough, and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG as well as coronary artery stent placement.  The heart
 size remains moderately enlarged.  There is worsening moderate alveolar
 pulmonary edema.  Additionally, a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and
 small right pleural effusion appear relatively stable.  There is persistent
 consolidative opacity within the left lung base, which could reflect
 compressive atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of moderate pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right, are relatively
 stable with persistent opacification of the left lung base.  This may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
