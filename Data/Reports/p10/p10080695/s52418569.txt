                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea on exertion. Fine inspiratory
 crackles throughout both lung fields with hypoxemia (___% POX on RA) at
 rest.  // Interstitial lung disease?     Interstitial lung disease?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the previous study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is some
 prominence of interstitial markings at the bases.  This could be a
 manifestation of pulmonary vascular congestion, though it also would be
 consistent with interstitial lung disease as suggested in the clinical
 history.  CT would be necessary to make the diagnosis of interstitial lung
 disease.
 Bibasilar opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms suggests
 atelectatic change with possible pleural fluid or thickening.  Single lead
 pacer extends to the apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.
