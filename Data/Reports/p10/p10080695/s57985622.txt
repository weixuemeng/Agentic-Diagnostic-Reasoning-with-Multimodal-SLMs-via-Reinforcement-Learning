                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of VF s/p ICD  // Crackles at bases
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures, limiting assessment of the patient's cardiovascular status.
 Streaky peribronchiolar bibasilar opacities are associated with apparent
 bibasilar bronchial wall thickening. No definite pleural effusion. ICD remains
 in place, with leads in the right ventricle. Mild elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm is again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities which could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or developing
 infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
