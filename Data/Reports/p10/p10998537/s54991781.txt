 and early edema.  The left costophrenic angle appears blunted, compatible with
 a small effusion.  No pulmonary consolidation or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. There is calcification
 of the aortic knob.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Early pulmonary edema with possible small left pleural effusion.
