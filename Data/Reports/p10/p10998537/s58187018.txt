 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD, end-stage
 renal disease, missed last two appointments, here with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the costophrenic angles on the frontal view, though not
 well substantiated on the lateral view.  There is mild prominence of the
 interstitial markings which are somewhat indistinct.  On the lateral view,
 there is a small patchy opacity projecting over the lower lung fields.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and unremarkable.

 Mild interstitial edema.  Patchy lower lung opacity seen on the lateral view
 could be due to infectious process.  Recommend followup to resolution.
