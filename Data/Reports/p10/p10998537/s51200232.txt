                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of left-sided chest wall pain.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia or pneumothorax.  Patient with possible left 5th rib fracture on
 prior radiograph.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aortal appears mildly tortuous with an calcifed
 aortic knob. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs
 demonstrate no focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.  There is no
 evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
 persistent.  Old right rib fractures are again seen.  The previously noted
 slight contour abnormality of the left 5th rib is not definitely seen on this
 exam.  No new displaced rib fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified.  The previously
 noted contour deformity of the left 5th rib is not definitively seen on this
 exam, however there is further clinical concern, dedicated rib films would be
 recommended for further evaluation.  No evidence of a pneumothorax.
