                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:54 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, abdominal pain,
 diarrhea and fever.  Is there evidence of pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with a strongly left atrial component and large
 pulmonary arteries are chronic.  I doubt that there is any acute cardiac
 decompensation, since there is no increase in baseline pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, no edema, or pleural effusion. Nor is there good evidence for
 infection.
