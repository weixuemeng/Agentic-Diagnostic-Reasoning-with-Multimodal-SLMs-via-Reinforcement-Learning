 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known healed right rib

 dedicated rib series might be helpful if further evaluation is warranted. 
 There is no evidence of a left pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
