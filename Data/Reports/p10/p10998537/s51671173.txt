                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest discomfort, productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  On the lateral view, a patchy opacity is noted posteriorly
 within the right lower lobe, which could represent atelectasis but developing
 infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacity within the right lower lobe, which could
 reflect atelectasis though developing infection is not excluded.
