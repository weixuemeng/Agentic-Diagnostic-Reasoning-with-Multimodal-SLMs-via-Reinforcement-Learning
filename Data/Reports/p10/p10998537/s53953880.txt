                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, there is no significant interval
 change.  Again seen is mild interstitial prominence which is likely due to an
 underlying background of emphysema.  The lungs are fully expanded, and the
 pleural surfaces are normal without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size, mediastinal contour, and hila are normal.  Old healed rib fracture along
 the lateral right seventh rib is again seen.  Atherosclerotic calcification of
 the aortic arch is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically, no
 evidence of pneumonia.
