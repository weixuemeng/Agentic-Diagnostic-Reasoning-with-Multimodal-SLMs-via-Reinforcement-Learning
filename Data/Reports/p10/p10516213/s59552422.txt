                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with midline picc.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a right PICC line projects over the right axilla, but has a slight
 turn, and may be entering one of the tributaries of the right axillary vein.
 Lumbar spine fixation rods are partially imaged.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion. Increased retrocardiac opacification may be due to a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid, however pneumonia is a
 possibility in the appropriate clinical setting. The right lung is clear.  
 There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC line curves in the right axilla vein, and may enter one of its

 Small left pleural effusion which likely coexists with left basilar
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with NP ___ the
 telephone on ___ at 10:11 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of the
