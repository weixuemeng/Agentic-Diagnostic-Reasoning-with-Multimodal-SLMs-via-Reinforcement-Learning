                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain and shortness of breath,
 question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is an equivocal opacity seen posteriorly
 in the lower lungs, probably in the right lower lobe and not necessarily
 changed; pneumonia or atelectasis could be considered.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague right lower lobe opacity, not specific but potentially
 pneumonia in the appropriate setting.
