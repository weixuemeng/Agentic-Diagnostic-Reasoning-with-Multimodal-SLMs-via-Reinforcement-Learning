 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient post-motor vehicle trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from the same time.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is somewhat limited by trauma backboard. There is a
 moderate left pneumothorax.  Multiple left-sided posterior rib fractures are
 present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged.  Opacities are
 noted in the left lung and suggestive of contusions and lacerations.
