 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube re-adjustment, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided chest tube
 has been slightly pulled back.  The dimension of the known left pneumothorax
 has minimally decreased.  However, parenchymal opacities, likely to be
 atelectatic, at the left lung base have slightly increased in severity.  No
 change in appearance of the right-sided lung.
