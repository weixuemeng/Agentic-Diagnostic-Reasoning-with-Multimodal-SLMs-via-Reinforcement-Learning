  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
  
  Mildly prominent superior mediastinum may relate AP technique and low lung
  volumes.  If clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, consider CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There relatively low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are slightly prominent
 which may relate to AP technique with low lung volumes.  There is central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 Mildly prominent superior mediastinum may relate AP technique and low lung
 volumes.  If clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, consider CT.
