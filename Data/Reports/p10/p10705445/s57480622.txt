                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia  // eval heart and
 lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy right base opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia along with
 atelectasis.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle of frontal
 view although so not well substantiated on the lateral view.  There is minimal
 left base atelectasis.  The patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient is somewhat rotated to the right.  Patchy right base opacity raises
 concern for underlying pneumonia, some of which may involve the lateral
 segment of the right middle lobe.  Right base atelectasis is also seen.
