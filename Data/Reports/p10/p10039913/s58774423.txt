 HISTORY:  Right lateral chest wall pain after motor vehicle collision.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the
 left lung base.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No displaced fracture is visualized.  Clips are seen within the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No definite displaced fractures are seen,
 but if there is continued concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib
 series is recommended.
