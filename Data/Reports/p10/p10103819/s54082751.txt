                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for nonspecific interstitial opacities in the lower lobes.  They
 potentiallymight reflect nonspecific interstitial lung disease or could be
 related to smoking if such a history is present.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
