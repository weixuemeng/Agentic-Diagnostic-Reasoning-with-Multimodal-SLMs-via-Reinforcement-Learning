                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  However, given
 this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Minimal prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may be due to mild vascular
 congestion.  No displaced fracture is seen.  Partially imaged is the right
 humeral prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion with otherwise no
 acute intrathoracic process.
