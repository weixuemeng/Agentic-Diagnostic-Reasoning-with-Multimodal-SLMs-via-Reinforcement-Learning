                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion, status post chest tube placement.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTA chest from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pleural drainage pigtail catheter has been placed.  The large right
 pleural effusion has decreased in size, now moderate. The catheter itself is
 remote from the remaining pleural fluid collection on this upright film,
 terminating in the medial mid lung. The proximal portion of the catheter takes
 an unusual course and appears slightly kinked, possibly at the site of entry. 
 There is no pneumothorax. The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Decrease in right pleural effusion after pigtail catheter placement, now
 moderate. The catheter terminates remote from the remaining pleural fluid
 collection while supine.
 2. No pneumothorax.
 3. Possible kink in the proximal catheter.
