                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing and shortness of breath.  Rule out congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs is
 unchanged.  Extensive reticular nodular opacities, worse in the bases, are
 likely changes from asbestosis.  
 
 Given the extensive parenchymal changes, excluding a superimposed acute
 process is difficult.  There are areas of minimally increased opacity,
 particularly in the right upper lung, which could indicate pneumonia but are
 more easily explained by pulmonary edema.  Follow up radiographs after
 diuresis are recommended.  
 
 No pneumothorax.  Pleural plaques are heavy.  Heart is normal size. 
 Compression deformities of the low thoracic spine are unchanged from at least
 ___.  Right upper quadrant clips are constant.  
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 16:12 on ___ by
 telephone, ___ minutes after discovery.
