                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD, dCHF(last EF ___% ___), AFib(aspirin and
 flecanide), prior admission for aspiration PNA, and IPF (Dr. ___), here
 with acute worsening shortness of breath and somnolence.  // intubated, eval
 tube, lung parenchyma    intubated, eval tube, lung parenchyma
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 New right PIC line in loops in the SVC, it terminating in the upper portion of
 the vein.  Left jugular line still ends in the right brachiocephalic vein.  ET
 tube and nasogastric tube in standard placements.
 
 Greater opacification in the right lung now relatively homogeneous makes it
 very difficult to distinguish any increase in asymmetrically distributed edema
 in a patient with severe chronic asbestosis from concurrent pneumonia.  Right
 pleural effusion is also likely, with non physiologic distribution determined
 by chronic pleural thickening and adhesions due to extensive asbestos related
 pleural thickening and calcification.  No pneumothorax.
