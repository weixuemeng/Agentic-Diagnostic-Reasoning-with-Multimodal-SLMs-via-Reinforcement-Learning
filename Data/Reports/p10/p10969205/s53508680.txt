 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:50 PM
  Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are increased in comparison to the prior
  study.  This may be partially due to lower lung volumes, however mildly
  increased pulmonary edema or underlying infiltrates would be difficult to
  exclude. Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are overall increased in comparison to ___, particularly in the right perihilar region.  Calcified pleural
 plaques are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are increased in comparison to the prior
 study.  This may be partially due to lower lung volumes, however mildly
 increased pulmonary edema or underlying consolidations would be difficult to
 exclude.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
