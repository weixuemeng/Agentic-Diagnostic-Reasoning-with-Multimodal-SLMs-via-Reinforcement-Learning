                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with bibasilar crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is flattening of the hemidiaphragms with
 increased AP diameter of the chest and coarse interstitial markings,
 suggestive of chronic pulmonary disease.  No definite acute focal pneumonia,
 though this could be difficult to detect in view of the extensive chronic
 changes.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular
 congestion.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
 
 There is an impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea, which
 could reflect a thyroid mass.
