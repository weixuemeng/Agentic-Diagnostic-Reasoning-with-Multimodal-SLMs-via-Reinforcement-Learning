                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for improvement in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 improvement in pulmonary edema with continued diffuse parenchymal opacities
 bilaterally.  These along with bibasilar calcifications are consistent with a
 history of asbestosis and interstitial lung disease.  Cardiomediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with continued
 parenchymal opacities bilaterally consistent with an interstitial lung
 disease.  Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
