                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with abnormal chest examination,
 followup abnormalities diagnosed in ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Appearance of heart shadow and mediastinal
 structures is unchanged.  Thus no marked cardiac enlargement is present.  The
 thoracic aorta is moderately elongated and shows rather advanced calcium
 deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  Similar as on several
 preceding chest examinations, there is an irregular pulmonary vascular
 distribution coinciding with increased interstitial markings on the lung
 bases.  One also observes extensive calcifications within the diaphragms as
 well as multiple partially calcified pleural plaques bilaterally.  New acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified and there is no
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  Evidence of a moderately wedge-compressed
 vertebral body in the lower thoracic spine as seen before.  Multiple surgical
 clips in right upper quadrant of abdomen unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiovascular findings, evidence of rather advanced
 interstitial fibrosis on the lung bases as well as evidence of pleural and
 diaphragmatic plaques consistent with previous asbestos exposure.  No evidence
 of acute new pulmonary infiltrates or advanced CHF in comparison with
 preceding studies.
