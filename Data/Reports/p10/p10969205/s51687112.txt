                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Prominent perihilar opacities suggest severe pulmonary edema although
 superimposed infection is not excluded.  There is blunting of the costophrenic
 angles of suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinum is also prominent but is slightly
 eccentric by the AP technique and relatively low lung volumes.  Bilateral
 calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques suggest prior asbestos exposure. 
 The patient has background of chronic pulmonary fibrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval development of prominent perihilar opacities suggest pulmonary edema.
 The opacities are right-greater-than-left which may be due to asymmetric
 pulmonary edema although infectious process is not excluded.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques suggest prior asbestos
 exposure.
 
 Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by
 portable, AP technique.  If concern for acute aortic/mediastinal process,
 chest CTA would be more sensitive.
