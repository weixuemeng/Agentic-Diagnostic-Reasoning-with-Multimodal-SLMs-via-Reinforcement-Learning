                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated w/ ARDS  // eval lines, tubes, lung
 fields
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube and NG tube and right-sided PICC line are unchanged in position.
 
 Extensive patchy interstitial alveolar opacities in both lungs, similar to
 prior film.  Possible slightly more confluence in the right mid zone, though
 this could also be accentuated due to differences in film technique.  However,
 opacity in the right mid zone has definitely progressed compared with ___ at 18:10.
 
 There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, consistent with  small pleural
 effusions and/or pleural thickening, not substantially changed. 
 Calcifications are present along both hemidiaphragms.
 
 Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Equivocal slight increase in opacity in the right mid zone compared to 1 day
 earlier, otherwise, no substantial change in chest findings compared with 1
 day earlier.  However, opacity in the right mid zone has definitely increased
 compared with 2 days earlier.
