                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPF, COPD, aspiration pneumonia  // ? ET
 tube placement, ? interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube again seen, tip approximately 2.3 cm of above the carina, pointing to
 the right.  NG tube present, with tip and side-port overlying the expected
 site of the fundus.  Right IJ central line tip overlies the cavoatrial
 junction, similar to prior.  No pneumothorax detected
 
 Allowing for rotated positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 unchanged.  Again seen are diffuse opacities throughout both lungs.  Allowing
 for technical differences, the extent is quite similar to the prior study,
 though subtle differences may be present.  In particular, the area of
 confluence in the right mid zone may be slightly improved.  Probable small
 right and possible tiny left pleural effusion.  Probable pleural thickening
 along the left chest wall.  , unchanged.  Calcification along the right and
 left hemidiaphragms is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described, similar to old 1 day earlier.
 
 Diffuse opacities in both lungs, with possible minimal improvement in the
 right mid zone.  The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes
 infection, atypical pulmonary edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, ARDS.  While the patient may have background
 chronic changes, given history of IPF, the appearance has progressed compared
 with ___, suggesting a superimposed process.
