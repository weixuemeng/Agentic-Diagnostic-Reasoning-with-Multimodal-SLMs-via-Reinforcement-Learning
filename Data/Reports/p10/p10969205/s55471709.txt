                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 This addendum completes the text of the report for the chest x-ray from ___.
 
 As compared to the image acquired at ___ on ___, the
 pre-existing extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities have almost completely
 cleared.  However, as indicated in the report from ___, remnant
 opacities are still visible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No earlier radiographs are available.  Bilateral basal pleural
 calcifications, suggesting potential asbestos exposure in the history.
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral apical thickening.
 
 Bilateral reticular opacities, predominating in the hilar lung regions,
 potentially suggesting fibrotic parenchymal changes.  In addition, bilateral
 alveolar opacities are seen, these could potentially reflect an infectious
 process.
 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Calcifications of the
 aortic arch.
