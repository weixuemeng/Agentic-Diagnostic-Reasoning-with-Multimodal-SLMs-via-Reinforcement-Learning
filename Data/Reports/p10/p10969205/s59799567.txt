                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of fibrotic lung disease status post
 recent fall downstairs on ___, now presenting with right lower
 lobe rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  Trauma torso from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Previously seen areas of multifocal
 consolidation on chest radiograph from ___ have resolved.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities persist and appear to have progressed since the prior
 chest radiographic examination.  In the absence of hilar enlargement,
 cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions, these increasing interstitial opacities
 may reflect worsening chronic fibrosis or superimposed atypical infection.  No
 confluent consolidation is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Calcified pleural plaques are again noted.  Surgical clips are
 seen within the right upper quadrant.  Compression deformity of the lower
 thoracic spine is similar to recent trauma torso CT.  Incidental note is made
 of calcifications in the region of the left carotid artery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reticular opacities which may reflect progressive lung fibrosis
 or superimposed infection.  Pulmonary edema seems less likely given the lack
 of associated features.
