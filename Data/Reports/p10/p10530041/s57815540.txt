                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic rectal cancer and wedge resection
 of a right lower lobe nodule, now with fever to 102 degrees, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 A small right apical pneumothorax remains.  There is multifocal airspace
 opacity, most airspace opacity surrounds chain sutures in the right lower
 lobe.  Along the right lateral chest wall, pleural thickening and/or effusion
 is unchanged from ___ but progressed from ___.  There is a small
 dependant right pleural effusion.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the right
 chest wall is similar compared with prior.  Multifocal linear atelectasis is
 seen bilaterally. Within the left lower lobe, there is a developing opacity
 concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Post-surgical changes in the right lower lobe with a small effusion,
 pleural thickening, and small right apical pneumothorax.  Airspace opacities
 in the right lung are improving over time, suggesting resolving post-surgical
 change, although pleural fluid has accumulated laterally in the chest from
 ___.
 2.  Developing opacity in the left lower lobe, in this clinical setting
 concerning for pneumonia.
