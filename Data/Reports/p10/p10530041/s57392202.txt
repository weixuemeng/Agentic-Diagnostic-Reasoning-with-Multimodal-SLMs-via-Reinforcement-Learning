 been opacity in this area, on today's study that opacity is slightly
 increased.  It is unclear if this is volume loss or infiltrate.  Pleural
 scarring is again seen on the right.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the region of prior surgery, unclear if this
 is volume loss or infiltrate.
