                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever and hypotension.  Evaluate
 for infiltrates or consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  The previously identified new pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrate in the right upper lobe area persists and has increased
 in size.  Noted is an additional rather well-demarcated round density in the
 right lower lung field overlying the sixth right-sided rib anteriorly.  It is
 possible that this later lesion existed already on the preceding study, albeit
 less prominent in comparison.  The possible mild blunting of the right lateral
 pleural sinus is again noticed, but does not extend into the posterior pleural
 sinus area which appears free on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonic infiltrate in right upper lobe area slightly
 progressing.  Round lesion in right lower lobe area is noted and deserves
 further followup.  Heart size remains within normal limits and no
 configurational abnormality is identified.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
