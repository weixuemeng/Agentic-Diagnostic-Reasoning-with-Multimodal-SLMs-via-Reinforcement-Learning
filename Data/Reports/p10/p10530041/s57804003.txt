                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after VATS lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Consolidation in the upper aspect of the postoperative right lung continues to
 clear.  Smaller irregular opacities have developed laterally at the level of
 the second rib, perhaps the residual of previous extensive pneumonia.  If
 patient has referable symptomatology, I would repeat a chest radiograph in two
 weeks, but if not, re-evaluation can wait until regularly scheduled chest CT
 scan in the surgical followup.  Volume of pleural fluid at the apex and base
 of the right hemithorax, is unchanged.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size is
 normal.  A right subclavian infusion port ends low in the SVC.
