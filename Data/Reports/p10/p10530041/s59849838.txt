                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of empyema after right lower lobectomy.  Please check for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the apical chest tube.  There is
 a right-sided port with the tip likely in the atriocaval junction.  The extent
 of the small basal pneumothorax has slightly increased compared to the prior
 exam.  Large apical and paramediastinal consolidation likely secondary to a
 hydrothorax is slightly increased in size compared to the prior exam. The
 right basilar chest tube appears to be in unchanged position, with the side
 port also in stable position. Heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal
 borders are unremarkable.  There appears to be slight interval increase in the
 focal consolidation overlying the lower right lung. There appears to be a new
 left hilar consolidation. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Slight interval increase in size of the right apical hydrothorax and right
 basilar pneumothorax compared to the prior exam.  
 
 2. New focal consolidations overlying the lower medial right lung and left
 perihilar area concerning for infection.
