                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube to waterseal.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study was just made available for evaluation.  In comparison
 with the study of ___, there is little change in the degree of apical
 pneumothorax on the right.  Some basilar pneumothorax is seen on the left with
 continued pleural effusion. Apparent increased opacification at the left base
 could represent developing consolidation.
