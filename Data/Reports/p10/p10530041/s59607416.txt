                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with history of right empyema, check interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The right basilar pneumothorax has partially re-expanded with a persistent
 right pleural effusion remaining.  There may be some loculated collections of
 air within the effusion.  Again seen is a large apical and paramediastinal
 consolidation, likely secondary to a hydrothorax or fibrosis.  The previously
 seen left hilar and right base consolidations have essentially cleared.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The right
 basilar chest tube appears to be in unchanged position.  A right-sided port is
 again seen with a catheter tip in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Partially reexpanded right basilar pneumothorax with a persistent,
 possibly loculated effusion.
 
 2.  Right apical consolidation, likely result of hydrothorax or fibrosis.
