                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right thoracotomy, wedge resection, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly better
 expansion of the right lung.  However, a 3-4 mm right apical pneumothorax is
 still seen.  Right chest tube is in unchanged position.  At the site of the
 resection, at the right lung base, there is an increasing area of parenchymal
 opacity, likely caused by post-surgical changes at overall decreased lung
 volumes.  This is supported by newly appeared atelectasis at the left lung
 base.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No hilar abnormalities.
