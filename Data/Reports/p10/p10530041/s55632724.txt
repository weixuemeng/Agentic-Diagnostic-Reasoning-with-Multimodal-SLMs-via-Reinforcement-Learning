                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis, colorectal
 cancer, increased ostomy output and now crackles in the right posterior lung
 fields.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and more remote radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  While opacities in the right lower lobe are consistent with post
 operative changes, these appear to be denser than on prior exams, arguing for
 a superimposed infection. A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower
 SVC, possibly extending into the right atrium.  Left lung is essentially clear
 with the exception of mild basilar atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: On top of the post operative changes in the right lower lobe,
 there is likely a superimposed infectious process.
