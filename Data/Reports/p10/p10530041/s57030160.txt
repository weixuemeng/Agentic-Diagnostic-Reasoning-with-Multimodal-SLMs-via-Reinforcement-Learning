                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post right lower lobe lobectomy.  Please
 evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right central venous access catheter terminates in the distal
 SVC.  A new moderate-to-large right pneumothorax, with an apical and basilar
 component is identified.  Two chest tubes enter at the base of the right lung
 and terminate at the apex, in adequate postion.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits. Mediastinal shift is difficult to
 asses due to positioning. However, no significant mediastinal shift is
 identified. The left lung is clear.  No definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate-to-large right pneumothorax.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
