                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right lower lobectomy now status post
 pleural washout and chest tube placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is markedly improved aeration of the right lower lung with persistent
 right mid lung consolidation, consistent with pneumonia, as seen on CT.  Large
 right basilar pneumothorax is present.  Mild left lower lung consolidation is
 slightly improved.  New density tracking along the right apex likely
 represents pleural fluid or blood.  A right chest tube coursing to the apex is
 again seen.  There has been interval placement of 2 additional right-sided
 chest tubes.  Right Port-A-Cath appears similarly positioned.  No left pleural
 effusion is seen.  Right hilar clips likely reflect prior surgery. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Improved aeration of the right lower lung status post washout with large
 right basilar pneumothorax and new right apical density which likely
 represents pleural fluid or blood.
 
 2. Persistent right mid lung consolidation, consistent with pneumonia, and
 improving left lower lung consolidation.

 p.m. on ___ after attending radiologist review.
