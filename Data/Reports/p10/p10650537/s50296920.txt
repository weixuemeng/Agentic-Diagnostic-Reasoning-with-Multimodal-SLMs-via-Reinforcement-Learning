  1. Catheter seen coursing from the left axillary region, crossing the midline
  chest, with tip projecting over the right lung apex.  Given the non-anatomic
  course of this catheter, it could be external to the patient, but clinical
  correlation is advised.
  
  2. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube.
  
  3. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion. 
  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect superimposed aspiration or
  infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known intracranial hemorrhage with clinical deterioration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi erect AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.9 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip is within the stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Aortic knob is calcified.  Perihilar opacities with vascular indistinctness is
 compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Focal opacities in the lung
 bases may suggest superimposed infection or aspiration.  Small left pleural
 effusion is likely present.  No large pneumothorax is identified.  A catheter
 is seen coursing from the left axilla, crossing the midline of the chest, with
 its tip appearing to project over the right apex of the lung.
