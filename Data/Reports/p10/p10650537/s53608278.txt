                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Basal ganglia hemorrhage, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper
 limits of normal in size.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 that are mildly engorged, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
