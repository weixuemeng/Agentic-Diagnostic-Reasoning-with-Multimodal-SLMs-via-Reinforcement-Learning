                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with possible lung collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure and opacification at the left base consistent with
 substantial atelectasis in the left lower lung and small pleural effusion are
 again seen.  Nasogastric tube is in the distal esophagus.
