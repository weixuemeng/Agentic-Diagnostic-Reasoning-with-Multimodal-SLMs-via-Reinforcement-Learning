                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stroke, please evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates bilateral low lung
 volumes.  Mediastinal and main pulmonary artery engorgement with dense air
 space opacification noted throughout both lungs as well as hazy pulmonary
 vasculature likely representing edema. Hear size is minimally enlarged.
 Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral opacities with hazy pulmonary vasculature
 likely represents pulmonary edema; however, concurrent pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.   Recommend repeat conventional radiographs when feasible.
