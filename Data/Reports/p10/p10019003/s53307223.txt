 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest without contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature, mild vascular
 congestion, and bibasilar atelectasis.  Heterogeneous retrocardiac opacity is
 present.  There is a new small left pleural effusion.  No right pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and
 patient positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
