                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with assault to face.  Rule out traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single view of the chest was obtained.  Overlying trauma board
 obscures detailed evaluation.  Lung volumes are extremely low, causing
 bronchovascular crowding.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The
 heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No displaced rib
 fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
