                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Discitis and osteomyelitis, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT C-spine from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Paucity of pulmonary markings in the right lung apex is compatible with severe
 bullous emphysema as seen on concurrent CT C-spine. Subtle opacity is present
 at the right lung base without definite correlate on the lateral view.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle opacity at the right lung base may be further evaluated with
 routine oblique views.
 
 2. Severe bullous emphysema at the right lung apex.
