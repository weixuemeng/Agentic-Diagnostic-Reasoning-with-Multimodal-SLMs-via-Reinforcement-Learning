                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for slight patient rotation, heart size and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged and within normal limits.  There is new slight
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with linear opacity at the left lung base,
 consistent with atelectasis.  No definite evidence of consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or definite evidence of pneumothorax; a linear density at the
 right lung apex likely relates to a skin fold.  Osseous structures appear
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left basilar atelectasis, no definite evidence of
 consolidation.
