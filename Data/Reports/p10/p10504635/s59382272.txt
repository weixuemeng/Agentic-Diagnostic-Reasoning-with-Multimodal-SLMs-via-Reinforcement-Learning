                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Recurrent AML with fever.  New onset shortness of
 breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patchy airspace opacities predominantly
 in a perihilar distribution and engorged pulmonary vasculature likely
 represent mild pulmonary edema.  There is mild peribronchial cuffing.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no free air beneath the
 hemidiaphragms.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bilateral perihilar airspace opacities and peribronchial
 cuffing most likely indicates pulmonary edema; atypical infection seems less
 likely although not excluded.
