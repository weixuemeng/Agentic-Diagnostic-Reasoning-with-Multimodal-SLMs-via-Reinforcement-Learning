 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:01 PM
  Increased hazy opacification of the lower lung fields bilaterally, right
  greater than left, which may be technical or may represent subtle infiltrate.
  Increased prominence of the mediastinal veins, which may reflect intravascular
  volume status. Increased prominence of the pulmonary arteries compared to
  ___, which may be secondary to volume status or pulmonary parenchymal
  process, but pulmonary emboli should be considered, particularly in the
  setting of acute desaturation. If clinically indicated, CT could be performed
  for further evaluation. Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 6:58 p.m. on
  ___ at the time of initial review of the study.

 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by new
 pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral perihilar haziness as well as
 increased distention of the azygous vein.  Scattered interstitial opacities
 are also new.  Constellation of perihilar opacities and peripheral
 interstitial opacities favors pulmonary edema, but a coexisting opportunistic
 infection is also possible in this patient with immunosuppression.  At the
 time of this dictation, a CTA has been performed and is dictated separately.
 Small pleural effusions are noted.
