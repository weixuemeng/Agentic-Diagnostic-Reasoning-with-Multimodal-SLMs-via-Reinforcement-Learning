                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with AML status post allogenic stem cell
 transplant.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A left approach central venous catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged from prior.  There has been interval
 removal of a right PICC.  Consolidation seen in the left lower lobe on recent
 chest CT from six days prior, may correspond to a subtle opacity seen on the
 current radiograph.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions are evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left basilar opacity may correspond to findings on recent
 chest CT.  No new opacities.
