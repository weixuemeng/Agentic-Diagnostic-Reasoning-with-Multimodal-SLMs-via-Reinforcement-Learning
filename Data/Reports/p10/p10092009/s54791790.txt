                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Increased density at the left lung base,
 which likely represents a combination of consolidation and possibly pleural
 effusion, perhaps loculated but small if it were to be confirmed.  Findings
 are concerning for aspiration or pneumonia given the clinical history.  There
 is mild to moderate interstitial abnormality consistent with interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due
 to the basilar opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacity, probably in the left lower lobe, suggesting
 pneumonia, atelectasis or potentially aspiration; potentially with loculated
 pleural effusion but not well delineated.   
 
 2.  Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 Follow-up standard PA and lateral radiographs are recommended after treatment
 of edema, if applicable, to assess left basilar opacification further if
 clinically indicated.
