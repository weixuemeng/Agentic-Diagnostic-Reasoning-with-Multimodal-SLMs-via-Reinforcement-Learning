                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Facial numbness, weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity may represent vascular structures, however, suggest dedicated
 PA and lateral views when patient able.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity may be due to vascular structures;
 however, recommend dedicated PA and lateral views for further and better
 evaluation, when patient able.
