                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with post intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam performed earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   There has been interval intubation
 with the endotracheal tube tip located approximately 3.4 cm above the carina. 
 Midline sternotomy wires again noted as well as overlying EKG leads.  Excreted
 contrast in the left renal collecting system is partially visualized. 
 Increasing ground-glass opacity within both lungs is concerning for worsening
 edema.  Patient is known to have severe emphysema.  A deep sulcus sign on the
 right indicates a small right pleural effusion on this supine radiograph. 
 Known right rib fractures are poorly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval intubation with appropriate positioned ET tube.
 2. Small right pneumothorax, new from prior.
 3. Worsening pulmonary edema, superimposed upon a background of emphysema.
