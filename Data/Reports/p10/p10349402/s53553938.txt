                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension elevated lactate.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views of the chest demonstrate a right pacemaker generator with atrial and
 ventricular leads.  Bibasilar opacities are seen which correlate with areas of
 consolidation on the concurrently obtained CT of the abdomen and pelvis which
 may represent atelectasis or infection.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  No pleural abnormality is perceived, although a small left
 pleural effusion was seen on the concurrently obtained CT of the abdomen and
 pelvis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities better seen on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis which may
 represent atelectasis or consolidation.  Small left pleural effusion is better
 seen on the concurrently obtained abdomen-pelvis CT.
