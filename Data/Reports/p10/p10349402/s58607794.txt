                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dementia with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Left retrocardiac basilar opacity is
 seen, which could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation due
 to infection or aspiration is not excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is somewhat tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial left basilar retrocardiac opacity is nonspecific,
 could be due to atelectasis, but underlying infection or aspiration not
 excluded.
