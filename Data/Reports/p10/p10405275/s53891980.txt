                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o +PPD (untreated) ___ week h/o cough
 and pleuritic cp with breathing.  // Is there evidence of pleuritis or other
 pulmonary disease?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate to moderately severe right convex scoliosis.
 
 The heart is not enlarged. There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. No
 pneumothorax detected. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar
 or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodule, calcified granuloma, or
 apical infiltrate is identified.
 
 Apparent prominence of the left hilum is likely artifact due to the patient's
 scoliosis as no hilar enlargement is seen on the lateral view from the ___ study and the frontal views are unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified. No radiographic evidence of pulmonary
 tuberculosis.
