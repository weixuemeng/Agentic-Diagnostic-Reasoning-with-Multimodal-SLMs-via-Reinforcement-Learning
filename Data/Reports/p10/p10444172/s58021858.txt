 There are bibasilar opacities, which become more conspicuous on the lateral
 view which may be in part due to lower lung volumes.  Superiorly the lungs are
 clear.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities, old healed right posterior rib
 fractures noted.  .

 Bibasilar opacities, accentuated on the lateral view which is notable for
 lower lung volumes.  While this finding could be due to atelectasis, infection
