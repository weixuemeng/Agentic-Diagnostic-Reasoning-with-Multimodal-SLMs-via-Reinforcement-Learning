 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, chills. Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A single lead pacemaker is seen projected over the left chest wall and
 extending to the right ventricle.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged. Streaky opacities at the lung bases, are compatible with
 atelectatic changes.  Again seen is an opacity in the retrocardiac region.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized osseous
 structures, aside from multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine,
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity in the retrocardiac region, potentially atelectasis noting
 infection is possible.
