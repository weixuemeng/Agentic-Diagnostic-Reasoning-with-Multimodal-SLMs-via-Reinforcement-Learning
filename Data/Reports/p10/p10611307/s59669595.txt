                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure activity, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  A single-lead
 pacemaker is again seen projecting over the left chest wall and lead extending
 to the region of the right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low.  Bronchovascular
 crowding likely accounts for mild left basilar opacity, though atelectasis
 versus mild aspiration difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting. 
 The aorta appears unfolded.  The heart size is stable.  No definite bony
 injury is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to low lung volumes with subtle opacity at the
 left lung base likely representing atelectasis or bronchovascular crowding,
 though subtle aspiration difficult to exclude.
