                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Newly diagnosed brain metastases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Consolidative opacity within the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure
 is new compared to the prior study, and given the history of brain metastases,
 is concerning for a neoplastic process. There is likely adjacent
 post-obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle suggests the presence of a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Left lung is
 grossly clear.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Consolidative opacity within the right upper lobe.  Given the history of brain
 metastases, findings are concerning for a neoplastic process with
 postobstructive pneumonia or adjacent atelectasis.  Further evaluation with CT
 is recommended.
