                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large right lower lobe mass is accompanied by bulky right hilar
 and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.  Additionally, numerous thickened septal lines
 are present within the right lower lobe, suspicious for lymphangitic spread of
 tumor.  Poorly defined opacities surrounding the right lower lobe and hilar
 masses could potentially represent a post-obstructive pneumonitis given the
 change in appearance since the prior scout image of the outside chest CT. 
 Relatively geographically marginated perihilar opacities on the left may
 reflect radiation changes, and less likely infection.  Heart size is normal. 
 A small amount of fluid is present within the right major and minor fissures,
 as well as a small dependent pleural effusion at the costophrenic angle.  Left
 pleural surfaces are clear.  Porta catheter terminates in the superior vena
 cava.  No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large right lower lobe mass with right hilar and subcarinal
 lymphadenopathy, in keeping with history of non-small cell lung cancer. 
 Likely associated lymphangitic spread of tumor and small right pleural
 effusion.
 2.  Poorly defined opacities surrounding right lower lobe mass represent a
 change from outside chest CT and could be due to either post-obstructive
 pneumonia or hemorrhage.
