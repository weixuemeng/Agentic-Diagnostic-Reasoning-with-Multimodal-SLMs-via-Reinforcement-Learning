                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated  // ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 17 53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  An NG
 tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.A
 Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlies the main pulmonary outflow tract. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Patchy increased retrocardiac
 opacity is similar, but probably slightly worse.  There is blunting the left
 costophrenic angle which could reflect presence of a small left effusion.
 
 There is hazy opacity at the right lung base, most likely representing
 atelectasis.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, limiting
 the assessment for small pleural effusion.
 
 Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 ET tube tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  Additional lines and tubes
 as described.
 
 Patchy opacity in retrocardiac region consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation is probably slightly worse.  A small left effusion is
 also present.
