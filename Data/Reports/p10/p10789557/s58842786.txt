                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain after fall 2 days ago.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The lungs are clear and
 hyperinflated, the latter suggestive of underlying COPD.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acutely
 displaced rib fractures are noted.  There are mild degenerative changes seen
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No displaced rib fractures identified. 
 If there is continued concern for a rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series
 is recommended.
