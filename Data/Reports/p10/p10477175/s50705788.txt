                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and delirium with alcohol abuse, assess
 for pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable upright radiograph was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is significantly rotated which limits assessment.
 Within this context a vague area of increased opacity at the right base is
 questioned. The heart and mediastinum are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Vague right basal opacity may be present though study is limited
 and repeat evaluation, preferably with conventional PA and Lateral views is
 recommended.
