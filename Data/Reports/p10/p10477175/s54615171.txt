                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: AMS and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  No CHF or effusion.  No gross consolidation.  Faint
 increased retrocardiac density with subtle air bronchograms may be present and
 could reflect the presence of a very early pneumonic opacity.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The area questioned on the ___ 11:11 a.m. film in the
 cardiophrenic region at the right base medially appears normal on today's
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal retrocardiac opacity.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate.
