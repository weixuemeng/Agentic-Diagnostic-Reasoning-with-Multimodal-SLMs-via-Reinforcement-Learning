  1. Markedly improved aeration of the left lung compared to the most recent
  prior examination status post stenting of the left mainstem bronchus. 
  Persistent opacity at the base of the left lung likely represents atelectasis.
  Infection should be considered in the appropriate setting.  Minimal
  atelectasis at the base of the right lung.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new LMSB stent  // r/o pneumothorax     
 r/o pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a left mainstem bronchus shunt with substantial Re aeration of the left
 hemithorax.  Persistent opacification at the left base most likely represents
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would be difficult to exclude.
 There are mild atelectatic changes at the right base.  The pulmonary vessels
 are indistinct and mildly engorged, consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
