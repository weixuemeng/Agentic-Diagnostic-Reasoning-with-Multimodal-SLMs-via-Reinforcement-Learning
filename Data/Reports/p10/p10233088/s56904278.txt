                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with renal cell carcinoma.  Rule out an
 intrathoracic process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___ read in conjunction with chest CT scans, most recently ___:
 
 Right hilar and subcarinal adenopathy have been present for several months or
 longer.  Hilar component is more striking today than it was in ___, even
 though chest CT scans show little change.  The subcarinal adenopathy, which is
 the larger, has always been subtle on chest radiographs, and that has not
 changed.  Peribronchial opacification in the left lower lobe has increased and
 there is mild elevation of the left lung base laterally, reflecting volume
 loss.  This represents a progression since the ___ chest CT.  The
 distribution of abnormality suggests aspiration may be the cause, perhaps
 secondary to esophageal compression by the subcarinal mass.  Right lung is
 essentially clear, heart size is normal and there is no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation.
