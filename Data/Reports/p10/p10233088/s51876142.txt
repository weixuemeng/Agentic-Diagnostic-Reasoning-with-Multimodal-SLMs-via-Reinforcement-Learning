                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met RCCA, s/p bilateral PNA //
 re-evaluation for PNA 6 weeks ago
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Previously seen bibasilar opacities have
 significantly improved from the prior study, however there is a subtle opacity
 in the right middle lobe. The upper lung zones are clear. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Previously seen at hilar adenopathy is less apparent on this
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significantly improved bibasilar opacities with residual opacity in the right
 middle lobe, which could represent atelectasis or possibly a new focus of
 pneumonia.
