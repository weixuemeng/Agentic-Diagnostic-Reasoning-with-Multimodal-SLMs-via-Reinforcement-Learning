                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, headache, dry cough, and sore throat.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Hazy opacification at the left base and
 in the retrocardiac space is likely atelectasis, given the low lung volumes,
 though an early pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar hazy opacity is likely atelectasis given the low
 lung volumes, though an early pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
