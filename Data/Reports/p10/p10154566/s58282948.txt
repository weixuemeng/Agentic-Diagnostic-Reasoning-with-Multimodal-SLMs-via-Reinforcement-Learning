 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Chest pain and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: None.

 without focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no free air beneath the
 hemidiaphragms.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
