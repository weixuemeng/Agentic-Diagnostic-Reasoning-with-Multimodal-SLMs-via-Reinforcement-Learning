                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of smoking, complaining of dyspnea on
 exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate minimal right
 basilar linear atelectasis, with otherwise clear lungs.  The cardiac
 silhouette is notable for a prominent epicardial fat. The retrosternal clear
 space is opacified, which may be due to prominent mediastinal fat although
 lymphadenopathy or mass could also have this appearance.  A nerve stimulator
 device is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of the retrosternal clear space, which is
 opacified, possibly the result of mediastinal fat although lymphadenopathy or
 mass is not excluded, and further evaluation with CT is warranted.
 
 Findings were entered into the radiology web-based results reporting tool for
 clinician notification.
