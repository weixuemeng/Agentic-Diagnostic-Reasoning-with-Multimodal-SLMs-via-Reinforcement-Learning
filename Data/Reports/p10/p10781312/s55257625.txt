 INDICATION:  ___M with ETT.  Evaluate positioning of ET tube and OG tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina, with an overinflated
 balloon in the trachea.  If desired 3-5 cm above the carina, then the
 endotracheal tube should be withdrawn approximately 2 cm.  An orogastric tube
 courses below the left hemidiaphragm and on a view.  The heart is enlarged,
 with a suspected small left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacity in the bilateral
 lung bases may be due to aspiration or atelectasis.  No large focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina, and should be
 withdrawn approximately 2 cm if desired to be 3-5 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  The endotracheal tube balloon is hyperinflated.
 
 3.  Bilateral lung base opacity is likely due to aspiration or atelectasis.
