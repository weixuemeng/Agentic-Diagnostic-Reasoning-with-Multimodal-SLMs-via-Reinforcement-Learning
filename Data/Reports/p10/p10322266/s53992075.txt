                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Hazy appearance of
 the left lung base is probably due to a large epicardial fat pad.  Scarring in
 the left upper lobe appears unchanged.  Although this area is difficult to
 assess, the lungs are probably otherwise clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
