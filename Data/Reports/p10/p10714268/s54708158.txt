                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LUE amputation now s/p reimplantation  //
 Eval endotracheal tube position      Eval endotracheal tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are exceedingly low exaggerating heart size which is probably
 top-normal.  Perihilar opacification in the left lung could be unilateral
 edema or aspiration.  Followup advised. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 15 mm from the carina, but the
 patient's mandible is flexed and given the low lung volumes the position is
 probably acceptable.
