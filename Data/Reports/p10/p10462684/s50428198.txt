                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for etiology of an oxygen requirement in a patient with
 meningitis and positive blood culture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a heart which is
 top-normal in size, unchanged.  There are again prominent interstitial
 markings, as before.  New indistinctness of the vessels is suggestive of mild
 pulmonary edema, with mild retrocardiac opacity obscuring the descending
 aorta.  This is most likely due to left lower lobe volume loss. There is no
 definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, new.  Mild retrocardiac opacity likely due to left lower
 lobe volume loss, without definite focal consolidation.
