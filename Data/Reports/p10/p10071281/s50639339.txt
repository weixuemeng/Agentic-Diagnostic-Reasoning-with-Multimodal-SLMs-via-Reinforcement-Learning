                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension, leukocytosis, and tachycardia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, AP views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are subtle, spiculated densities with possible calcifications seen
 within the right lung base, findings which may represent scarring. There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or overt pulmonary edema identified.  The
 heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  A displaced right
 midclavicular fracture appears to be chronic and demonstrates nonunion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe spiculated densities and possible calcifications.
 Findings may represent chronic scarring. In the absence of prior comparison
 examinations, non-urgent chest CT is recommend for further characterization.
 
 2.  Chronic, displaced right midclavicular fracture appear
