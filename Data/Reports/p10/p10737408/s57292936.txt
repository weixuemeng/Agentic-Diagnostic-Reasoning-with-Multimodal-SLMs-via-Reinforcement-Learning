                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, HTN, HLD p/w SOB, ?heart block,
 possible infiltrate on outside imaging  // Pneumonia?     Pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is pulmonary
 vascular congestion with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  Although no definite evidence of acute pneumonia,
 given the pulmonary changes in the absence of a lateral projection, it would
 be difficult to definitely exclude superimposed pneumonia.
