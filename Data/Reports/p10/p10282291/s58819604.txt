                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, chest pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Previously seen 10 mm spiculated nodule in the right apex is
 better assessed on the previous CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Mild compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Previously noted 10 mm right apical
 spiculated nodule is not well assessed on the current exam, and as recommended
 on the previous CT, a followup chest CT is suggested for further assessment.
