                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cellulitis and new onset of
 cough, examine for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size is
 moderately enlarged.  In comparison with the preceding study of ___, the at
 that time existing mild cardiac enlargement has further increased.  There is
 no typical configuration abnormality; however, the left ventricular contour is
 more prominent than normally.  The pulmonary vasculature shows now a mild
 degree of perivascular haze on the bases and the pleural spaces show a touch
 of mild degree of blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses, all
 consistent with mild degree of chronic left-sided CHF.  There is no evidence
 of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and no pneumothorax exists
 in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax remain unchanged and
 grossly within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild progression of cardiac enlargement with mild degree of
 pulmonary congestion.  Consider dehydration therapy, possible chest x-ray
 followup to confirm the official results.
