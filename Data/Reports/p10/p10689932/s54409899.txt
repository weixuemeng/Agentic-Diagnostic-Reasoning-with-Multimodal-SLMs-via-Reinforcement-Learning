                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with prior inflammatory lung disease
 and pneumonia.  Evaluate for complete resolution of bilateral lung processes.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  Unaltered appearance of thoracic aorta, mediastinal
 structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  The previously described findings of
 low positioned and flattened diaphragms in conjunction with the
 hypertranslucent appearance of the lung bases remains.  Direct comparison on
 the frontal view suggests that the depression of the diaphragms and flattening
 is slightly less marked than it was two weeks before.  This could indicate
 presently less air trapping, but the findings are chronic and by no means
 eliminated completely.  On the other hand, there is no evidence of the on
 previous chest examinations identified inflammatory changes seen on chest CT
 and PA and lateral chest examinations during ___.
