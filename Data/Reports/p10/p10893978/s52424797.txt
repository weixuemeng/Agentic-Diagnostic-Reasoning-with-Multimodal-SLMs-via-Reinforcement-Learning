                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, elevated d-dimer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures and mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Linear opacities are seen
 in both lung bases likely reflective of subsegmental atelectasis.  Small right
 pleural effusion is likely present.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular engorgement in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  Probable trace right pleural effusion.
