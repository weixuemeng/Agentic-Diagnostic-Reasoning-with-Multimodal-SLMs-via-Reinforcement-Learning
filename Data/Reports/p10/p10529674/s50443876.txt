                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, query pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mild biapical thickening is stable.  Hazy opacification at
 the right lung base is new, may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis, but pneumonia is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
