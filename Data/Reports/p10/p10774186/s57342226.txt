                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with fall, assess for fractures.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier.
 
 There are lower lung volumes.  There are increasing opacities in the lower
 lobes consistent with increasing atelectasis.  Small bilateral effusions are
 more conspicuous than before.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Mild
 interstitial edema has increased.  Multiple calcified lymph nodes in the
 mediastinum and hila are again noted.  Sternal wires are aligned.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema.  Of note, evaluation of rib fractures
 is very limited due to technique and patient body habitus.  If clinical
 persistent concern, dedicated rib series are recommended.
