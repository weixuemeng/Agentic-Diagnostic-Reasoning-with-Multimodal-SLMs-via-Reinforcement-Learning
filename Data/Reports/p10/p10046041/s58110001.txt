                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of abnormal white blood
 cell count, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Areas
 of mild left base linear atelectasis are seen.  Particularly over left mid
 lung, between the posterior left seventh and eighth ribs, is a 7-mm nodular
 opacity, which may represent overlapping structures, however pulmonary nodule
 is not excluded and further evaluation with oblique chest radiographs is
 recommended.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Degenerative changes are seen in the right acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  7-mm nodular opacity at the left mid lung for which further
 evaluation with oblique radiographs recommended.
