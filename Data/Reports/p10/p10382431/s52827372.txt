                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with diabetes with history of breast cancer and
 right chest pain.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is calcification in the arch and
 descending thoracic aorta.  There is ill-defined increased opacity projecting
 in the left apex over the first left anterior rib.  This could be
 superimposition of normal structures, but a lung nodule or scarring can be
 also present.  A lung nodule projecting in the right base over the anterior
 fifth rib could be a granuloma.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, CHF,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined nodular opacities in the left apex and in the right
 lower lobe warrant further evaluation with CT.
 
 No acute findings.
