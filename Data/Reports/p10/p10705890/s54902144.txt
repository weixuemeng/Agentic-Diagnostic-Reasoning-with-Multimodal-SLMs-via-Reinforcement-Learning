                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with coronary artery disease with shortness of
 breath for one day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  There are increased
 hazy opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left.  This could be in
 part due to overlying soft tissues and portable technique.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear of consolidation, although mild indistinct pulmonary vascular
 markings are seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Median sternotomy wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right
 greater left basilar opacities potentially in part due to overlying soft
 tissues and atelectasis.  If desired, PA and lateral views of the chest could
 help clarify.
