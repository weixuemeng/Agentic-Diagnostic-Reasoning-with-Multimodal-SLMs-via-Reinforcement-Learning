                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:05 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary edema and hypoxia on dialysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Bilateral consolidation previously strongly basilar has improved at the lung
 bases, but now is more extensive in the upper lungs.  Suspect this is
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but
 not large.  Upright conventional chest radiographs would be extremely helpful
 in evaluating these findings.  Dual-channel right supraclavicular dialysis
 catheter ends in the right atrium and SVC.  No pneumothorax.
