                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with patient
 positioned upright.  There is left basilar linear density with volume loss
 most likely reflecting atelectasis, though an early pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude in the right clinical setting.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for an unfolded thoracic
 aorta with atherosclerotic calcifications.  No definite bony abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity at the left lung base which likely represents
 atelectasis, though an early pneumonia not excluded.
