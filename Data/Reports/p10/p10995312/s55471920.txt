                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes that may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter
 of the heart.  There is increasing opacification at both bases with
 silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms.  This is consistent with pleural effusions
 and compressive atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia could not be excluded.
 
 Of incidental note are skin ___ projected to the right of the mid and
 upper lungs.
