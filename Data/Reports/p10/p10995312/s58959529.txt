                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Patchy and
 linear opacities have developed at both lung bases and favor atelectasis over
 infectious pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be helpful if clinical
 suspicion for infection persists.  Possible small pleural effusions are noted.
