                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left chest pain and L flank pain  // PLeas eval
 for any infiltrates on CXR. Please eval for hydro on US.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Subtle opacity overlying the left lower lobe is most
 notable on the lateral view.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle left lower lobe opacity may be secondary to low lung volumes.  If there
 is no significant clinical suspicion for pneumonia, recommend repeat PA and
 lateral chest with emphasis on inspiration.  If pneumonia is clinically
 suspected, findings can be considered compatible with pneumonia.
