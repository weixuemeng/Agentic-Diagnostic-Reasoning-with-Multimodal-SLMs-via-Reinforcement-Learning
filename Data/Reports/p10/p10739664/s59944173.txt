 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:38 PM
  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  Relatively rounded retrocardiac opacity most likely due to a hiatal hernia but
  this is not definitive based on this chest x-ray.  Correlation to confirm this
  finding with prior imaging is suggested if possible.  Alternatively,
  additional nonurgent imaging could be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with a syncopal episode, no evidence of headstrike  //
 evaluate for acute lung or cardiac process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but clear without consolidation, effusion, or
 edema.  There is a somewhat rounded retrocardiac opacity in the frontal view
 likely projecting over the spine on the lateral view.  This may be related to
 a hiatal hernia, although no definitive lucency within the opacity, or
 potentially a Bochdalek's hernia Old healed mid left clavicular fracture is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Relatively rounded retrocardiac opacity most likely due to a hiatal hernia but
 this is not definitive based on this chest x-ray.  Correlation to confirm this
 finding with prior imaging is suggested if possible.  Alternatively,
 additional nonurgent imaging could be considered.
