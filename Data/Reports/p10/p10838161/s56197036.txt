                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever with clinical concern for pneumonia, here to evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs performed since ___, most recently ___ at 11:33.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just
 below the level of the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  A right subclavian
 approach central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated
 in the setting of retrocardiac opacification and silhouetting of the right
 heart border and bilateral hemidiaphragms.  The mediastinal contours appear
 prominent, which is likely related in part to technique, but appears stable
 since ___.  There has been gradual increased opacification at
 the right lung base over multiple recent prior studies dating back to ___.
 There is silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm.  Retrocardiac opacification
 is also increased over prior studies with silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are greater on the right than the left.  No pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Progressive bibasilar consolidations concerning for worsening infection,
 atelectasis, or both.
 2.  Small pleural effusions on the right greater than the left.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
