                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with lung opacities, here to evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 05:42.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right subclavian central
 venous line is unchanged in position.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely
 evaluated but likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are prominent
 but stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is increased from the most recent
 prior study.  There is indistinctness of the right hemidiaphragm with streaky
 opacification of the right lung base compatible with small pleural effusion
 and associated atelectasis.  There is increased opacification at the left lung
 base with a meniscus suggesting increased small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion with associated atelectasis or consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion,
 increased from ___.
 2.  Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Progressive bibasilar consolidations may represent worsening atelectasis,
 but superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 context.
