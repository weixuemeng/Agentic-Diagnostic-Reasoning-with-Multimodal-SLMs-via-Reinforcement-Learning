                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ET tube in place and pneumonia.  Question
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tip of ET tube at 2.5
 cm above the carina with patient's chin tilted upward.  A right subclavian
 approach central venous catheter has tip in the mid SVC.  Low lung volume is
 persistent.  Dense retrocardiac opacity persists, compatible with atelectasis.
 Upper lungs are clear.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits allowing
 for semi-upright position and AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. ETT tip 2.5 cm above carina with chin up, suggesting it would be low lying
 with patient in neutral position.  Suggest withdraw by 2 cm. 
 
 2. Persistent left cardiophrenic atelectasis.
