                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation with recent volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of
 normal in size.  Continued obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent
 with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion.
