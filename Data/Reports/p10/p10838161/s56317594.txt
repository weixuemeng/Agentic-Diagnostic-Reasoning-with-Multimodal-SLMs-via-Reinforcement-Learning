                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, for Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the Dobbhoff tube lies
 in the lower body of the stomach.  Endotracheal tube remains in good position.
 Again, there is increased opacification at the right base medially with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, worrisome for middle lobe pneumonia in view
 of the clinical history.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume
 loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.
 
 There is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, though some of this could be a manifestation of low lung
 volumes.
