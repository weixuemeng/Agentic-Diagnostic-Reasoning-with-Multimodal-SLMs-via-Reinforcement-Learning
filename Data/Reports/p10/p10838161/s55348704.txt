                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with intracranial bleed status post intubation.  Assess
 for ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  The NG tube is positioned within the stomach.  The lung
 volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are prominent, which likely relate to technique and
 low lung volumes.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Perihilar vascular
 congestion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Partially imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Appropriately positioned endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.  Low lung
 volumes.
