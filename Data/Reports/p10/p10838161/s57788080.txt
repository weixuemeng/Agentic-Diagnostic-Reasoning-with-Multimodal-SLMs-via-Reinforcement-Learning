                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post Dobbhoff tube placement, check
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 549.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 10 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval attempt at placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which courses to
 the level of the thoracic inlet and then heads cephalad with the tip not
 identified.  Re-positioning is advised.  A nasogastric tube remains in place,
 which courses below diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. 
 Endotracheal tube unchanged in position with tip approximately 3.5 to 4 cm
 above the carina. There is bibasilar patchy opacity as well as bilateral
 effusions, left greater than right.  These findings may reflect partial lower
 lobe atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat more prominent suggesting a fluid
 replete state, but no overt pulmonary edema is evident.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  Results of
 this examination were conveyed to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on
 ___ at 12:53 p.m.
