                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset shortness of breath for ___ hours.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced, with the heart size appearing borderline
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is
 no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Streaky opacity within the left lung base
 may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly decreased lung volumes with streaky left basilar opacity, possibly
 reflecting atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
