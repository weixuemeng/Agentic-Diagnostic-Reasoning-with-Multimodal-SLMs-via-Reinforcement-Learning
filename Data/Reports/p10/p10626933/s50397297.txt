 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, bacteremia, metastatic cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 7:20 p.m.:
 
 Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is larger, and mild pulmonary edema
 has developed.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tip of the
 endotracheal tube is above appropriate positioning, no less than 5 cm above
 the carina with the chin down.  It should be advanced 2 to 3 cm.  Left
 subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, dual-channel right internal jugular line
 ends in the upper right atrium, all devices unchanged from the most recent
 prior study.  No pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is probably still
 substantial.
