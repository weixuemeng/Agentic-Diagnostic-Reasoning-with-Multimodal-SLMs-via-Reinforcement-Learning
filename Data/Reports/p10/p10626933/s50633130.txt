                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic carcinoma with sepsis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Monitoring and
 support devices remain in place.
 
 There is increasing opacification at the left base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm.  Although there is mild obliquity of the patient, there does
 appear to be some shift of the mediastinal structures to the left, raising the
 possibility of substantial volume loss in the lower lobe.
 
 This information has been conveyed to Dr. ___.
