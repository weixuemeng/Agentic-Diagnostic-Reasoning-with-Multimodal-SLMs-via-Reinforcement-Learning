 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new hemodynamic instability, known pleural
 effusion and respiratory failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:

 have improved since ___, supine view done at 3:39 a.m.  Left lower lobe still
 remains substantially atelectatic.  Heart is normal size and there is no
 mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest volume overload.  Nevertheless
 pulmonary findings could be due to edema from left heart function or
 noncardiogenic edema.
 
 Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC, and a right internal jugular
 dual-channel catheter ends in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
