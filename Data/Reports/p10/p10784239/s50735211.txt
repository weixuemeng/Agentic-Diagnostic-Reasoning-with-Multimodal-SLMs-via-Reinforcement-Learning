                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Possible mild cardiomegaly.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at both bases.  Relative patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 angle is noted, ? atelectasis.  The possibility of an early pneumonic
 infiltrate would be difficult to entirely exclude, but no frank consolidation
 is identified.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  Otherwise, no acute
 pulmonary process.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar right-greater-than-left atelectasis.  Early right
 cardiophrenic angle infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
