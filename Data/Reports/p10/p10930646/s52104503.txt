                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p prolonged inpt stay, TAVR   PM, poor
 mobility   fluid overload, assess for acute process  // assess for acute
 process     assess for acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there has been a substantial increase
 in the left pleural effusion and a moderate increase in the right pleural
 effusion.  Obscuration of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the lower lobes, especially on the left.  The pulmonary
 vascularity may be mildly elevated.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia,
 though this would be difficult to exclude given the extensive enlargement the
 cardiac silhouette effusions.
 Degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine with loss of height
 of a mid dorsal vertebra.  Of incidental note again are calcific
 opacifications consistent with joint bodies in the region of the right
 shoulder.
