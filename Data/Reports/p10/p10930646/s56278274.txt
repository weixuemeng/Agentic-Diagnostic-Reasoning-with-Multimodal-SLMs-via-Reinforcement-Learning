                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusions and pericardial effusion
 s/p drainage ___. Repeat CXR to assess possible reaccumlation or
 worsening. s/p TAVR ___  // pleural effusion status, reaccumulation   
 pleural effusion status, reaccumulation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of all ___, there again is bibasilar
 opacification consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis,
 more prominent on the left.  The appearance on the left has substantially
 changed, reflecting a more upright position of the patient so that the hazy
 layering along the posterior chest wall seen on the previous supine study is
 not appreciated.
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there again is evidence of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
