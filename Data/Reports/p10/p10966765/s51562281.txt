                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with non-STEMI, stent, now with leukocytosis, low-grade
 fever, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe pulmonary edema has significantly improved and is now mild.  Residual
 opacity at the lung bases is slightly asymmetric on the left, which could
 still be resolving pulmonary edema.  Close attention to this area on followup
 is suggested to rule out pneumonia.  There are also small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Significant improvement of pulmonary edema which is now mild.
 2.  Asymmetrical opacity in the left lung base could still be residual
 pulmonary edema; however, short-term followup is suggested to rule out early
 pneumonia.  
 
 This was discussed at 11:55 with Dr ___.
