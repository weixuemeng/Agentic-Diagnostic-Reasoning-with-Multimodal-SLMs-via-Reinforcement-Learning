                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  There are bilateral patchy and interstitial
 opacities, mainly central and basilar in location.  This is most consistent
 with pulmonary edema.  There is at least mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. 
 Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a retrocardiac opacity of
 which pneumonia cannot be definitely ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.  Likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity of which pneumonia cannot be completely ruled
 out.  Recommend follow up radiographs after resolution of symptoms.
