 INDICATION:  Cough and weakness for the past five days, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  There is horizontal
 streaky opacification of the bilateral lung bases and right middle lobe,
 compatible with atelectasis.  A tiny calcified granuloma projects over the
 right mid lung.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size or mildly enlarged.  The thoracic aorta is
 tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal
 limits.  There is slight deviation of the trachea to the right by the aortic
 knob.  Biapical scarring is greater on the right than the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right middle lobe and bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with tortuous aorta.
