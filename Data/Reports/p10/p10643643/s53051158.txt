                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes remain low.  There is horizontal
 streaky opacification of the bilateral lung bases and right middle lobe, most
 compatible with atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  A tiny
 calcified granuloma projecting over the right mid lung is unchanged.  There is
 no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged but stable.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable.  Biapical scarring on the
 right greater than the left is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right middle lobe and bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.
