                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance in the
 postoperative period in this patient status post recent median sternotomy and
 mitral valve replacement.  Central venous catheter continues to terminate in
 the lower superior vena cava.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax is in retrospect
 slightly smaller than on the previous radiograph.  Slight worsening of left
 retrocardiac atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion.  Small right
 pleural effusion is apparently new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased size of left pneumothorax with residual tiny pneumothorax
 remaining.
 
 2.  Worsening left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 3.  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.
