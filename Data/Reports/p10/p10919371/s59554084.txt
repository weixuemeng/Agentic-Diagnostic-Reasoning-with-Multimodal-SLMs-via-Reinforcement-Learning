 COMPARISON:  03:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is continued evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  Interstitial markings are prominent, possibly due to
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Mediastinal structures are stable.  A left PICC
 now terminates in the region of the lower superior vena cava. An endotracheal
 tube ends at the thoracic inlet. A feeding tube no longer traverses the
 mediastinum. The tube with the side hole is projected over in the left where
 it appears to be coiled. No free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying compressive atelectasis.  A small
 focal area of parenchymal consolidation cannot be excluded. Possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lines and tubes as described.
 Results called to MICU A at 09:20.
