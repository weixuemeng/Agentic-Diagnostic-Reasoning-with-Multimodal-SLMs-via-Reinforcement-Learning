                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with upper GI bleed intubated for EGD  // placement of ETT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the Carina and could be
 withdrawn slightly for standard positioning.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits for technique.  Lower left heart border is poorly
 defined. It is uncertain whether this is due to focal atelectasis, scar, or an
 early focus of infectious consolidation. Short-term followup radiographs may
 be helpful in this regard.
