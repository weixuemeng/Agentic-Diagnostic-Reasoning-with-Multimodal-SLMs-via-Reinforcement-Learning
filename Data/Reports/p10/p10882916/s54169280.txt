                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of small-bowel obstruction,
 abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and PA and lateral
 chest radiograph from ___.  A chest radiograph from ___ was also analyzed for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A hazy opacity of the right upper lobe is not significantly changed
 from prior studies.  Otherwise, the remaining lung fields are clear without
 focal opacities.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Sternotomy wires are intact.  A nasogastric tube is seen with both the side
 port and the tip above the GE junction.  Repositioning is advised.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hazy opacity in the right upper lung field is not significantly changed
 and likely represent an area of chronic airspace disease. Overlying infection
 cannot be excluded.
 2.  Nasogastric tube with both side port and the tip above the
 gastroesophageal junction raised increased risk for aspiration.  The tube
 should be advanced at least 12 cm.
 
 Discussed with Dr ___ ___ resident) by Dr ___ ___ telephone immediately
 after discovery of the findings.
