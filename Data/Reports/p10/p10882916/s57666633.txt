                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ PNA  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the patient now carries a nasogastric tube.
 The tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach.  Vascular
 right-sided stent is again visualized.  Minimal scarring at the right lung
 bases.  In the right upper lobe, however, there is a virtually unchanged
 parenchymal opacity that is relatively widespread and shows air bronchograms. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia is the most likely differential
 diagnosis.  Because of the longstanding duration of the changes, further
 workup with CT should be considered, to evaluate reason for the chronicity of
 the changes.
