                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shoulder pain, abdominal pain, right upper extremity
 swelling, question DVT.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires are again noted.  The previously noted NG tube has been removed.  Linear
 opacities in the right upper lobe are again noted, which could represent
 scarring or atypical infection.  Please note this opacity was not seen dating
 back to x-rays from earlier this year.  A stent projects over the left
 subclavian region.  Aside from findings in the right upper lobe, the lungs
 appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  There are small surgical clips noted in the right upper lung/superior
 mediastinal region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle linear opacities in the right upper lobe could represent
 atypical pneumonia or scarring.  Recommend followup to resolution.
