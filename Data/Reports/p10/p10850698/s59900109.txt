                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with two to three weeks of slightly
 productive cough,physical examination unchanged from usual bilateral rales. 
 Old TB, compare findings with ___ examination.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and remains within normal
 limits.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified.  A permanent
 pacer is again noticed in left anterior axillary position connected to a dual
 intracavitary electrode seen to terminate in positions compatible with right
 atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly.  The
 cardiac configuration is unchanged and again shows a mild relative prominence
 of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly, a finding which
 in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta
 suggests the possibility of a systemic hypertension.  The pulmonary
 vasculature, however, is unchanged and not congested.  As before, there is a
 relative prominence of the central pulmonary vessel and attenuation of
 peripheral pulmonary vessels consistent with general emphysema, but no local
 areas of abnormalities or infiltrates can be identified.  The diaphragms are
 somewhat low positioned and slightly flattened but again unchanged and there
 is no evidence of pleural effusion.  Apical area is free.  One has
 difficulties to identify scars or remnants of an old tuberculous infection in
 the lungs for which the patient received treatment in the ___.
 
 A chest CT ___ is also reviewed and confirms the present
 findings suggestive of chronic emphysema but absence of any acute pulmonary
 congestion or infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no new abnormalities.
