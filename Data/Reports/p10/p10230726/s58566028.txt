                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided demonstrating no
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  There is apparent elevation of the right distal clavicle which is
 not included in the field of view, which is potentially concerning for a right
 AC joint separation.  Please correlate clinically.  Otherwise, bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Apparent elevation of the right
 distal clavicle raising potential concern for AC joint separation.  Correlate
 clinically.
