                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increased retrocardiac density as
 compared to prior.  Additionally, a broad curvilinear lucency is visualized in
 this region.  Findings may be due to a small hiatal hernia and less likely a
 necrotic pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up PA and lateral chest radiographs for
 further assessment.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing retrocardiac opacity with adjacent lucency, most
 likely a hiatal hernia.  Follow-up PA and lateral chest radiographs is
 recommended.
