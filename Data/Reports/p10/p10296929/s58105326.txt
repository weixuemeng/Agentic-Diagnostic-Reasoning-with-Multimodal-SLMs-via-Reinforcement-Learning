                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Compared to prior, there has been no significant interval
 change.  Again seen is a retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the descending
 thoracic aorta.  This could potentially be due to a hiatal hernia; however, PA
 and lateral views suggested to confirm as mentioned on prior.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs remain clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Retrocardiac opacity,
 likely hiatal hernia; however, PA and lateral suggested to confirm.
