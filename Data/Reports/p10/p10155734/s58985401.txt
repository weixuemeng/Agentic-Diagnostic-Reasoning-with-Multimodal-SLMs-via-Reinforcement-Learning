                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dizziness.  Question mass or pneumonia.
 
 There is increased opacity identified at the right lung base associated with
 architectural distortion and blunting of the costophrenic angle.  Less
 significant changes are also identified at the left lung base laterally. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and
 there is prominence of the hila.  Metallic densities project over the region
 of the right shoulder, seen predominantly posteriorly on the lateral view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Architectural changes in the lungs suggestive of fibrosis with
 more confluent opacity at the right lung base.  Findings are suggestive of
 chronic process; however, superimposed acute infection or mass is difficult to
 assess without prior for comparison.
