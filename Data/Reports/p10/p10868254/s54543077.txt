                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Consolidation in the left lower lobe and lingula has slightly
 worsened.  A subtle opacity in the periphery of the right middle lobe has
 improved.  Bilateral upper lobe pleural and parenchymal scarring appears
 similar to the prior study as well as left lateral pleural thickening.  Healed
 rib and sternal fractures are noted, and unchanged compression deformities are
 evident within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of left lower lobe and lingular consolidation
 which has waxed and waned on serial radiographs since ___. 
 Although possibly due to chronic or recurrent aspiration, CT of the chest may
 be helpful to evaluate for possible endobronchial abnormality or
 bronchiectasis if warranted clinically.
