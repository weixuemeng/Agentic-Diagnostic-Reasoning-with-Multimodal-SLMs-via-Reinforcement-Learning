 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, substernal, abscess for pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  The lungs appear clear
 without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is subtle
 effacement of the right and left heart border on the frontal projection, which
 likely reflects the presence of epicardial fat pad.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  The bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
