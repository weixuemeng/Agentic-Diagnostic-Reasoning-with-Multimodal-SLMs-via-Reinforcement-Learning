                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath for several weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the
 patient's neck and chin projecting over and obscuring this region.  The heart
 size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is present.  Streaky right basilar opacity is seen, though no
 focal consolidation is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is present. 
 S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with obscuration of the lung apices.  Within these
 limitations, there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky right
 basilar atelectasis.
