                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left subclavian Port-A-Cath is
 seen with its tip in the mid to low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  There is increased reticular opacity within the lungs most prominent
 in the right upper lung, possibly reflecting worsening fibrosis.  Difficult to
 exclude a subtle superimposed pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Imaged bony structures are intact.  A CBD metallic stent projects over the
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fibrotic changes in the lungs, appear increased in conspicuity from prior
 chest radiograph, may reflect worsening fibrosis versus superimposed atypical
 pneumonia.
