 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Oblong opacity projecting over the right upper lung is compatible with
 calcified pleural plaque.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No obvious effusion
 identified noting that there is exclusion of the right lateral costophrenic
 angle on the frontal view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable given
 differences in projection.
