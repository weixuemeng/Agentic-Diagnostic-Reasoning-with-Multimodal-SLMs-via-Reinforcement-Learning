                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with hepatitis C cirrhosis, now status
 post OLT on ___.  Anastomotic stricture with leak.  Active oozing from
 sphincterotomy, check location of feeding tube tip.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the lower chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.
 
 On this frontal view of the lower chest and upper abdomen, one can identify an
 NG tube that passes through the esophagus makes a large loop within the
 expected site of the fundus of the stomach and continues in the course
 compatible with antrum and the pylorus.  The final curvature simulates that of
 the duodenum so that the tip of the line is expected to be located in the
 proximal jejunum.  Moderately air-distended colon structures are identified
 outlining the transverse and descending colon.  In the right-sided abdomen, a
 row of cutaneous metallic clips is identified indicating recent abdominal
 surgery.
 
 On the previous chest examination, a Dobbhoff line was present and was seen to
 curl up in the fundus of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Present NG line has passed stomach and duodenum and apparently
 with tip in proximal jejunal loop.
