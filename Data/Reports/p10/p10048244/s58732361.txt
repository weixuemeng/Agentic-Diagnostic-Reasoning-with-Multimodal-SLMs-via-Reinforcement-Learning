                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Dobbhoff dislodged.  Evaluate placement of
 the tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior radiograph, there is no significant change in
 calcified pleural plaques.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There
 might be a small right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no left-sided pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 A Dobbhoff tube is again seen, which appears to end in the second portion of
 the duodenum, given its posterior course of the last portion in the lateral
 radiograph.  A CBD stent is in place.  There is no evidence of abdominal free
 air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Dobbhoff tube
 appears to end in the second portion of the duodenum.
