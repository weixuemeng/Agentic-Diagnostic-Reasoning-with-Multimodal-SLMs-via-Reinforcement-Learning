                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  ET tube in situ with the tip below the level of the medial
 clavicles ___.4 mm proximal to the carina.  Nasogastric tube in situ in the
 stomach.  Right-sided PICC line with its tip at the cavoatrial
 junction/proximal right atrium.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe with air bronchograms. 
 Subsegmental atelectatic changes in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is consolidation of the medial aspect of the left lower lobe which may
 represent atelectasis or an early pneumonia.  I get the impression of volume
 loss which favors atelectasis.
 Please take note of the low position of the ETT.
