                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent fevers status post advancing diet with mild tachypnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 9:38am.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  Pulmonary edema is improved but
 persists compared to 1.5 hours earlier. Left basilar opacity is also improved.
 A small left pleural effusion is again noted.  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal
 silhouette are stable.  Leftward deviation of the trachea suggests right
 thyroid enlargement.  Degenerative change is noted in the right shoulder
 girdle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary edema persists but is improved compared to 1.5 hours earlier
 with a small left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
