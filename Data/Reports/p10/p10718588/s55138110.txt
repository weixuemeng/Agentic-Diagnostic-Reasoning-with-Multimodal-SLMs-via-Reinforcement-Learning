                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  One episode of fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as cervical spine CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Leftward deviation of the upper trachea suggests enlarged right
 thyroid lobe.  Increased central pulmonary vasculature, interstitial markings,
 and small bilateral pleural effusions.  In setting of stable cardiomegaly,
 findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema.  Dense opacification in the
 retrocardiac space is likely atelectasis.  
 
 High-riding right humeral head suggests chronic rotator cuff injury with
 secondary osteoarthritic changes including humeral osteophyte formation,
 subchondral cysts and sclerosis of the acromion.  Angulation of the right
 lateral ribs suggests trauma, likely remote.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsened pulmonary edema. Increased though still small bilateral pleural
 effusions
 2.  Enlarged right thyroid lobe.
 3.  Chronic rotator cuff injury with associated arthritic changes.
