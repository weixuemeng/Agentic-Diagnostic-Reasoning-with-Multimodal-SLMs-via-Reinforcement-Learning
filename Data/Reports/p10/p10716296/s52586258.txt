                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and cough  // R/O new infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, bibasilar reticular
 opacities are minimally improved and, upon correlation with recent chest CT,
 could represent chronic interstitial disease.  Lungs are mildly hyperexpanded.
 Minimal pleural thickening of the left apex is again seen.  No new
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pulmonary edema or vascular congestion. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Heart is mildly enlarged and in
 the setting of prominent tissue markings, could represent chronic interstitial
 lung disease, pulmonary arterial disease or both.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged bibasilar reticular opacities correlate with interstitial lung
 disease, better described on prior CT.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly, which could be a sequela of chronic interstitial lung
 disease, pulmonary arterial disease or both.
