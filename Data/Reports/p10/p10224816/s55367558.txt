                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate left lung
 base opacity, which is mostly of a linear configuration which suggests
 atelectasis, though the possibility of an early pneumonia is impossible to
 exclude.  Right mid lung plate-like atelectasis is also noted.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable and
 within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities in the lower lungs, left greater than right.
