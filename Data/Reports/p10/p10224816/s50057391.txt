                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICD implant, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement
 of a dual-channel pacer device with leads in the right atrium and region of
 the apex of the right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal in size, but there is no evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Of incidental note are surgical clips in the lower neck.
