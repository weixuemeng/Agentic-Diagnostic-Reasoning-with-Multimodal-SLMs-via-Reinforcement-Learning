                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  CT chest ___, AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea on exertion and mild hypoxemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and later chest x-ray were obtained and compared to the
 immediate preceding chest radiograph. There is presence of median sternotomy
 wires.  There is a biventricular pacing system with leads terminating in the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and left anterior oblique marginal vein.  There
 are also wires from a previously placed and removed right pacer.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There are stable increased
 interstitial markings at the bilateral bases, but no new lung parenchymal
 opacity.  There is mild blunting of the costophrenic sulci consistent with
 small pleural effusions; however, there is no evidence of interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
