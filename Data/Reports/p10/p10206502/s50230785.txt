                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, food impaction, oliguria and recent EGD
 with cough, SOB and worsening oliguria  // please assess for pulm edema   new
 PNA.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___ at 01:27 and allowing for technical differences,
 the medial left hemidiaphragm is slightly less distinct.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  An AICD type device and leads are unchanged. 
 Abandoned leads also noted.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette with sternotomy wires, is unchanged.  Background
 COPD with hyperinflation again noted.  Patchy increased interstitial markings
 are present in both lungs.  These could represent a combination of  chronic
 fibrotic changes and/or superimposed edema.  Again seen is blunting of both
 costophrenic angles.  In this setting, superimposed infectious infiltrates
 would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive interstitial markings again seen in both lungs, most pronounced at
 the bases.  The medial left hemidiaphragm is slightly less distinct than on
 the prior film, raising the question of more confluent opacification in this
 area.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change
