                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough x2 weeks, fevers, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___,
 and CT torso dated ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Median sternotomy wires are noted to be aligned and intact.  A biventricular
 pacing system is seen with leads terminating in right atrium, right ventricle,
 and left anterior oblique marginal vein.  Additionally noted are wires from a
 prior right pacemaker.  Redemonstrated are stable interstitial markings, most
 prominent in the bilateral lung bases, and consistent with the patient's known
 interstitial lung disease.  There is no focal consolidation, overt pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  The heart size is
 normal.  The aorta is noted to be tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable interstitial lung disease.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
