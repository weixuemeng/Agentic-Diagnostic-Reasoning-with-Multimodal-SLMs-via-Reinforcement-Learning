                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There are perihilar and
 bibasilar opacities which may relate to fluid overload, although underlying
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No large pleural effusions are seen, although trace pleural
 effusions be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perihilar and bibasilar opacities may relate to fluid overload,
 underlying aspiration or infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Recommend repeat after diuresis.
