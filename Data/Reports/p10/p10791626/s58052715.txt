                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  A moderate-sized hiatal
 hernia is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with unfolding of the thoracic aorta again noted with diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  Symmetric widening of the superior mediastinum is also
 unchanged, and may reflect mediastinal lipomatosis or enlarged thyroid.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Moderate size hiatal hernia. 
 Persistent widening of the superior mediastinum could reflect mediastinal
 lipomatosis or an enlarged thyroid gland.  Consider further evaluation with
 chest CT.
