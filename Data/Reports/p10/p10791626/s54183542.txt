                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increased lethargy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  Patchy atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the
 ascending aorta and the arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Aside from streaky left basilar opacification suggesting minor atelectasis,
 the lungs appear clear.  A moderate to large hiatal hernia is noted with an
 air-fluid level.  The bones are probably demineralized to some degree.  Lower
 thoracic interspaces show slight biconcave endplate depressions typical for
 sequelae of bony demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Substantial hiatal hernia.
 
 3.  Suspected bony demineralization with very mild biconcave lower thoracic
 compression deformities.
