 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There relatively low lung volumes. Patchy right basilar opacity which may be
 exaggerated by low lung volumes would also raise concern for underlying
 pneumonia. Left basilar atelectasis is seen. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volume which accentuate the markings.  Patchy right basilar opacity
 may be accentuated by the low lung volumes, but raises concern for underlying
 pneumonia.
