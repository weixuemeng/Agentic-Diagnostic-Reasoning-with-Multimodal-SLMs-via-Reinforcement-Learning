                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic bronchitis with 3 weeks of cough, mostly nonproductive,
 assess for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well expanded and clear
 lungs.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with no adjacent
 atelectasis to suggest volume loss. The apparent elevation may be secondary to
 dextroscoliosis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
