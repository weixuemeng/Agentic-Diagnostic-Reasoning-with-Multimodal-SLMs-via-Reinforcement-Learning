                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:27 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  New hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 10:34 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes have improved and consolidation at the right lung base has
 decreased suggesting that earlier findings are due to a large scale recent
 aspiration, and secondary pneumonia if any is really quite small.  The small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions and mild left lower lobe atelectasis
 persist.  A small collection of air projected over the right diaphragmatic
 region is unexplained.  It could be a tiny pneumoperitoneum.  This examination
 is marked, upright, but if confirmation of pneumoperitoneum is required then
 conventional upright chest radiographs should be obtained.  Left subclavian
 infusion port ends in mid to low SVC.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings and their clinical significance by
 telephone at the time of dictation.
