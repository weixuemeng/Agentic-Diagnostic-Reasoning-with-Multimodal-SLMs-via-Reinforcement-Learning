                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Triple lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads similar in position.  There is
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  Calcifications project over the left mid lung.  No right pleural
 effusion is seen.  The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.
