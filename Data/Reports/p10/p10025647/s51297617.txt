                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, pacer firing, history of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle
 and coronary sinus.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The aorta is tortuous
 and diffusely calcified.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Previously noted
 multifocal opacities have largely resolved with minimal residual opacity seen
 within the right lung base.  No new focal consolidation is present.  Small
 left pleural effusion persists.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in previously noted multifocal opacities, with residual
 right basilar opacity likely reflecting resolving pneumonia.  Small left
 pleural effusion, unchanged.
