                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary edema after
 diuresis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is substantial interval
 improvement up to almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 retrocardiac opacity is noted in the left lower lung, potentially representing
 atelectasis.  Pacemaker leads including the abandoned lead terminate in right
 atrium, right ventricle and the left ventricle epicardial location.  Small
 amount of pleural effusion is better appreciated on the lateral view, most
 likely on the left with potentially minimal amount of right pleural effusion
 demonstrated as well.
