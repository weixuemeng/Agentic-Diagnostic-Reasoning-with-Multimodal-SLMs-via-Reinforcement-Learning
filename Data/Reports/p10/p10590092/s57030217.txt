                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia at outside hospital.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is patchy opacity at the right base, consistent with pneumonic
 infiltrate and/or atelectasis.  There is also atelectasis and/or scarring at
 the left base.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no CHF.  Note is made
 of pleural thickening along the lower right greater than left chest walls. 
 Probable small right effusion.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal,
 with left ventricular configuration.  There is slight unfolding of the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Patchy opacity at the right base. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 this could reflect a pneumonic infiltrate.
 3.  Probable atelectasis left base.
