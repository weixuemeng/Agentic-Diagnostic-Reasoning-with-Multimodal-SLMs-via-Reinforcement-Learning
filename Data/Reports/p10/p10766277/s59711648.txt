                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, wheezing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is likely related to low
 lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  Small
 right pleural effusion is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis,
 but aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded.  Small right
 pleural effusion.
