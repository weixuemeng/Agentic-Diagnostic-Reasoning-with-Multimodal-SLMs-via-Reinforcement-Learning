                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NH lymphoma presents with failure to thrive,
 now with hypoxia  // Any acute process in lungs (fluid overload, PNA, etc) to
 explain new hypoxia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing extent.  Of bilateral parenchymal opacities that pre existed.  The
 symmetry of the changes would favor pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia. 
 However, no other signs suggesting pulmonary edema are present so that
 bilateral pneumonia should be considered.  Minimal increase in extent of
 bilateral pre-existing pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Normal size of
 the cardiac silhouette.
