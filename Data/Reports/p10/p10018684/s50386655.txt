 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is suboptimal due to underpenetration, or presumed secondary to patient
 body habitus.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinum is also
 widened however, given patient body habitus, this may be due to mediastinal
 lipomatosis.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal study due to underpenetration presumed secondary to patient body
 habitus.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Possible underlying
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  Possible central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
