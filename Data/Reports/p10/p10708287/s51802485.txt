                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cyclical vomiting syndrome and
 multiple other issues, currently on TPN, now with worsening dyspnea and
 productive cough for several weeks, no fever, declining ED, evaluation. 
 Pneumonia?
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.
 The heart size remains normal.  No configurational abnormality is present. 
 Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  Previously present right-sided PICC line has
 been removed.  A new right internal jugular approach line has been placed and
 is seen to reach down into the upper third of the right atrium.  Point of
 termination is clearly within the right atrium and if risk with mechanical
 contact of cardiac structures is to be avoided, it is recommended to withdraw
 the line by approximately 4 cm so to terminate in the mid to lower portion of
 the SVC.  No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area and no new
 pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Pleural spaces are free.  As before, there
 is evidence of a previous orthopedic stabilization procedure in the lower neck
 region.
