                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is slight blunting of the right
 posterior costophrenic angle which may be due to hyperinflation and pleural
 thickening although trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  The aorta is
 tortuous and calcified.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There is biapical pleural thickening.  The
 bilateral humeral heads are high riding, which can be seen in rotator cuff
 disease.  Old right-sided rib fractures are seen.  Degenerative changes are
 seen along the spine.  There is severe compression of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body/vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate
 age, given lack of prior studies for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe compression of lower thoracic vertebral body/vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate age, given lack of priors for
 comparison.
 2.  Tortuous aorta.  No definite focal consolidation.
