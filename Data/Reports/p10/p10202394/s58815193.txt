                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath, edema.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable except for interval progression of the
 azygos vein size that might be consistent with progression of the volume
 overload, especially given the interval development of widespread parenchymal
 opacities concerning for pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted that also can be seen on the prior examination and overall, the findings
 are concerning for progression of pulmonary edema.  Underlying infectious
 process is a possibility.
