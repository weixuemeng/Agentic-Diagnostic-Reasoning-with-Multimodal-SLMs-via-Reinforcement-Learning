                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the torso from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  An AP upright view of the chest was obtained with a total of two
 exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear opacity at the left base is most likely atelectasis and/or
 scarring.  It is similar to the prior CT. Subtle left midlung/perihilar
 opacity is also seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is likely due to a small left pleural effusion.  There
 is no large right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion.  Left mid lung opacity may be
 atelectasis although infection is also possible.
