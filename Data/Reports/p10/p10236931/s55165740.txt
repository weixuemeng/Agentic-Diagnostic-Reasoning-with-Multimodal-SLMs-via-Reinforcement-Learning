                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Not available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are mildly increased bilateral interstitial opacities as well as mild
 cephalization of pulmonary vasculature and thickening of the fissures
 suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally, a left basilar opacity is
 noted and may represent atelectasis versus early developing infection.  There
 is mild blunting of bilateral posterio costophrenic angles suggestive of small
 bilateral pleural effusions. The heart is moderately enlarged. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch and the aorta is
 slightly tortuous but at the upper limits of normal in size.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine. No acute
 fractures are identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly, a pericardial effusion is
 possible. 
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis or an early
 developing infection in the proper clinical setting.
