  Interval increase in patient's large right pleural effusion which appears
  loculated.  Increased airspace opacity at the right lung apex may represent
  atelectasis due to increased diffusion but underlying infection cannot be
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Patient is a ___M with a history of T2DM c/b CKD (baseline Cr 
 1.2) and PAD requiring multiple bypasses and amputations, CAD c/b MI in ___
 (arrest, stroke w/ residual expressive aphasia, bare metal stent to LCX, AICD
 implantation) and HFrEF (EF ___% on last echo ___), AF not on AC, chronic
 alcohol abuse c/b chronic pancreatitis, and hypothyroidism who was originally
 admitted for RLE cellulitis (at site of previous amputation in early ___), hospitalization complicated by chest pain/CHF exacerbation, small
 vessel vasculitis, and acute renal failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval increase in the now large right pleural effusion which appears to be
 possibly loculated.  New opacity at the right lung apex may represent
 compressive atelectasis from the worsening effusion or alternatively a focal
 consolidation.  Unchanged cardiac conduction device.  A right central venous
 line ends in the mid SVC.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in patient's large right pleural effusion which appears
 loculated. Increased airspace opacity at the right lung apex may represent
 atelectasis due to increased diffusion but underlying infection cannot be
 excluded.
