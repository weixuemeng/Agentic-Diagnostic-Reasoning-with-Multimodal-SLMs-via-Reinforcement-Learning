                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased work of breathing  // edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen right apical pneumothorax is much smaller or completely
 resolved.  Possibility of a very small residual pneumothorax would be 
 difficult to exclude given lordotic positioning.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is right focal
 consolidation focal opacity in the right mid/lower zones consistent with focal
 consolidation and a right-sided chest tube.  Cardiomegaly is similar to prior.
