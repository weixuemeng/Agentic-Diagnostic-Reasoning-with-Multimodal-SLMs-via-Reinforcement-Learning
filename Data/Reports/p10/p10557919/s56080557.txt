                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased work of breathing  // edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 41
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right chest is grossly unchanged. There may
 have been slight interval improvement in the right base aeration.  There is
 increased opacity at the right base suggestive a combination of consolidation
 and only minimal pleural fluid.  Right-sided chest tube again noted.
 
 The possibility of a tiny right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
 
 Cardiomegaly with a pacemaker is again seen, unchanged.  Left lung remains
 grossly clear.   Doubt CHF.
 
 Old healed right posterior rib fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible new tiny right apical pneumothorax.
 
 Continued right base opacity.  This likely represents combination of right
 base consolidation and a small amount of pleural fluid.  Aeration at the right
 lung base may be slightly improved.
