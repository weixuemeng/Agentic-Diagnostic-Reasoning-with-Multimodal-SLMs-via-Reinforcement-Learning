                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent aspiration pneumonitis versus acute
 eosinophilic pneumonia, now recovered and at rehab.  // Evaluate recent lung
 parenchymal changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Radiographically, the lungs appear clear except for minimal faint residual
 opacities in the left upper lobe, and persistent focal scarring at the right
 base.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Postoperative
 changes are seen within the spine, and posttraumatic and or postsurgical
 deformities are present in the right ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent near resolution of diffuse pulmonary opacities, but note that CT is
 more sensitive and conventional radiographs for detecting ground-glass
 opacities.  If warranted clinically, CT may be considered for more complete
 assessment of the lungs
