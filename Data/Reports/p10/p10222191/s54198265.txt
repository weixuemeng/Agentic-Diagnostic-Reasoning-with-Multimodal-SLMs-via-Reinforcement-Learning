                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in pleural effusions in patient with
 severe pancreatitis status post exploratory laparotomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, which have slightly increased in
 size compared to the study obtained two days ago.  Mild pulmonary and
 mediastinal vascular engorgement persist.  There is bibasilar atelectasis,
 with secondary signs of improvement within the left lower lobe.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A tracheostomy tube sits in the
 mid trachea, and is slightly rotated, directed toward the left wall of the
 trachea.  A left internal jugular central venous line terminates in the low
 SVC.  A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly out of the
 field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight enlargement of moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.
