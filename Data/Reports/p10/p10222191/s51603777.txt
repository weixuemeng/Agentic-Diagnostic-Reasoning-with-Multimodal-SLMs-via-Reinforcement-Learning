                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pancreatitis, status post
 orogastric tube advancement, confirm placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with a portable chest examination in
 semi-upright position obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are persisting.  Slightly change in fluid density
 appearance on the bases is probably related to positional change of patient. 
 A nasogastric tube was identified as being in standard position.  It was seen
 to reach approximately 10 cm below the expected level of the diaphragm.  On
 the present image, it has further advanced but its tip is outside the image
 field.  Previously described right subclavian approach central venous line
 remains in unchanged position and terminates overlying the upper third of the
 right atrium.
