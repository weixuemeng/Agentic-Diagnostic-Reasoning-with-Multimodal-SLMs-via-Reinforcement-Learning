                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal decrease
 in extent and severity of the pre-existing right lower lobe opacities that,
 however, still remain visible and are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Mild atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions.  Mild fluid overload but no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Unchanged low lung volumes and mild cardiomegaly.
