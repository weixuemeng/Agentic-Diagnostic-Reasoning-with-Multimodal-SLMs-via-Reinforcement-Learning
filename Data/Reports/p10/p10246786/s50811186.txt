                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. A small right pleural
 effusion persists with associated right basilar compressive atelectasis. 
 Streaky left opacity in the left lung base also likely reflects atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 re- demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small to moderate size right pleural effusion with right basilar
 opacity, likely compressive atelectasis. Minimal streaky left basilar
 atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
