                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with end-stage renal disease, presenting with
 malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears normal.  Aortic knob calcifications are noted. Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable. A moderate to large right pleural effusion is
 demonstrated. Right basilar opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis.
 Infection is not excluded. Left lung is grossly clear. Pulmonary vasculature
 is normal. No pneumothorax is seen though assessment of the apices is somewhat
 obscured by the patient's neck soft tissues. Multilevel degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine with osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion with right basilar opacity likely
 reflective of atelectasis. Infection is not excluded.
