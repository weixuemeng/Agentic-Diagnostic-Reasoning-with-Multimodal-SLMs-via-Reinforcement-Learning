                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema.
 Decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior, there has been interval development of a
 moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.  More focal opacity seen on the
 lateral view projecting over the spine is of uncertain etiology, potentially
 superimposed parenchymal consolidation or lesion.  The left lung is clear
 without effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given
 silhouetting on the right.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic
 arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Flowing anterior osteophytes seen in
 the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of moderate right-sided pleural effusion
 since prior.  Focal opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view
 should be followed on subsequent exams.
