  New bilateral heterogeneous opacities are likely a combination of atelectasis,
  aspiration or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Recent fundoplication with barium swallow concerning for leak
 with shortness of breath.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates hypoinflated lungs with new
 bilateral heterogeneous opacities.  Linear plate like opacity within the right
 upper lobe is most consistent with atelectasis.  Again seen are few tiny
 nodules and increase in lung markings due to bronchiectasis better
 characterized on CT trachea dated ___.  1.4 x 1 cm hyperdense area
 lateral to the spine in the upper abdomen is most consistent with previously
 described contained variant focus.
 
 There is a small amount of pleural thickening along right-greater-than-left
 chest walls may be related to body habitus.  Along the No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No effacement of the costophrenic angles is identified to
 indicate large effusion the patient is status post sternotomy, with
 mediastinal clips.  The heart is mildly enlarged, but likely  accentuated due
 to low lung volumes and patient positioning.  Mediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.
 
 Extreme posterior portion of the chest excluded from the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New bilateral heterogeneous opacities are likely a combination of
 atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is requested.
 2. No pneumothorax detected.  No pneumomediastinum identified.
 3. Small density in the left upper abdomen adjacent to the spine is compatible
 with the previously described barium focus.  Additional contrast noted in in
 the upper abdomen likely lies within the stomach.
 4.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 5:07 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
