                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  High-grade uterine sarcoma, with shortness of breath,
 questionable pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a moderate right
 and a small left pleural effusion that are likely unchanged.  A mild right
 lung parenchymal opacity could reflect pneumonia.  Given the clinical
 presentation of the patient, short-term radiographic followups are indicated. 
 There is an unchanged evidence of retrocardiac atelectasis.
