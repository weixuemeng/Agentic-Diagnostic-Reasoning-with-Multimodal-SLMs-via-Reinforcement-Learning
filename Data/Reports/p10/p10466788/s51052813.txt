 nodules seen on CT of ___ are below the resolution of radiography.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Fullness of the right mediastinum is explained
 by known subcarinal mass, better seen on recent CT of ___.  An adjacent
 fiducial is seen at the right hilum.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No appreciable pulmonary lesions.  Multiple pulmonary nodules seen on
 prior CT of ___ are below the resolution of radiography.
 2.  Stable post-treatment changes of the right hemithorax.
 3.  Right mediastinal fullness due to known subcarinal mass better seen on CT
