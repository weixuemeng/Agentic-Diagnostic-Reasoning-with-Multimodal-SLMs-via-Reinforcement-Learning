                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough for a week.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to scout radiograph from CT from ___. 
 Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 patient's known mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better assessed on CT.  The
 patient is status post right upper lobectomy.  Post-radiation changes are
 again seen along the right mediastinum.
 
 There is mild left base atelectasis.  In the interim since the prior study,
 there has been increase in opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with
 consolidation, which may be due to infection.  There has been interval removal
 of a  right-sided Port-A-Cath.  D ual leadleft-sided pacemaker is stable in
 position.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Postoperative changes are seen in the right upper
 hemithorax.
 
 Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen, and a trace pleural
 effusion is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation, which may be due to infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting (worsening of metastatic disease would not be
 excluded).  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
