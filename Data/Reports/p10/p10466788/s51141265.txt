 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma,

 Dual-lead pacemaker and mediastinal or hilar clip are unchanged.  No focal
 consolidation is seen with persistent enlargement of the hilar contours,
 particularly on the lateral view, compatible with known subcarinal adenopathy.
