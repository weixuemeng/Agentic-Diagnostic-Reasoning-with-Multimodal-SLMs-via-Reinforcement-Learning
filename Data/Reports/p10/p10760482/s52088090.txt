                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and without change. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are grossly clear except for
 minimal linear scarring in the mid lung region on the lateral view.  No
 pleural effusion.  Bones are demineralized, and note is made of scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No conventional radiographic findings to suggest pneumoconiosis.  
 
 Please note that previously evaluated right paratracheal mass is not well
 evaluated by chest radiographs based on its pretracheal location.  
 
 Therefore, if there is clinical concern for the status of the pretracheal
 mass, a cross-sectional imaging study such as CT or MRI would be recommended.
