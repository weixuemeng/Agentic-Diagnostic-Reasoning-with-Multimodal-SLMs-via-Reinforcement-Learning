                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  DKA with unknown precipitant and weakness, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well aerated without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An oblique density
 projecting over the left lateral lung base likely reflects plate-like
 atelectasis in the lingula, unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
