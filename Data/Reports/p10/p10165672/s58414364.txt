                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A poorly-defined area of consolidation has developed in the
 periphery of the right upper lobe, with a somewhat rounded configuration of
 the consolidation and internal lucencies, which probably represent air
 bronchograms.  No additional similar areas of consolidation are seen elsewhere
 in the lungs, but note is made of several thickened septal lines in the
 periphery of the lung bases, right greater than left.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged, but stable in size, and the aorta is tortuous without change.
 Possible new small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Peripheral right upper lobe consolidation, which may represent a bacterial
 "round" pneumonia.  However, considering the patient's immunocompromised
 status, fungal infection should also be considered, particularly if the
 patient is neutropenic, as well as Nocardia.  Consider CT for further
 characterization if warranted clinically.
 
 2.  New basilar septal lines, which may reflect mild interstitial edema or an
 interstitial component of the infection.
 
 3.  Small right pleural effusion.
 
 Findings and recommendation communicated to the office of Dr. ___ by
