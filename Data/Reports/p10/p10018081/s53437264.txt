                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to
 atelectasis, although coexisting infectious consolidation is possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, similar appearance of the chest
 compared to the previous radiograph performed several hours earlier.
