                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ years old man with pneumatosis, portal/mesenteric venous
 catheter, status post exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy for
 ischemic colon and prior anastomosis, now status post abdominal closure,
 ileostomy with Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of the same day at 4:00 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view portable chest x-ray shows Dobbhoff tube with tip
 ending in mid gastric cavity.  Left lung base opacity has worsened since prior
 chest x-ray due to increased pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse. In
 the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be considered. Right lung is
 clear without consolidation, nodules or pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is partially obscured by left pleural effusion but
 appears within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Correct positioning of Dobbhoff tube ending in mid gastric
 cavity.  Interval increase of left lung base collapse and pleural effusion, is
 concerning for pneumonia.
