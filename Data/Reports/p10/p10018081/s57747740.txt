                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with probable pneumonia.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is slight improved aeration of the
 left lung base as compared to most recent prior radiograph, likely due to
 decreased atelectasis.  However, a moderate consolidation and associated
 moderate effusion persist and are consistent with the clinical history of
 pneumonia.  There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion, mild, though no
 overt interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  An enteric catheter
 terminates within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged left lower lobe pneumonia, with slightly improved aeration
 likely due to decreased adjacent atelectasis.
 2.  Increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
