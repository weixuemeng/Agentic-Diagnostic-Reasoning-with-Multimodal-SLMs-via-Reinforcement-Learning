 A left-sided PICC line terminates at the mid SVC. An orogastric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, the tip projects over the gastric fundus. The heart is
 enlarged and stable. Again seen is elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Bibasilar consolidations are again seen, likely reflective of pleural effusion
