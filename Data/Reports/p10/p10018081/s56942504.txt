 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___

 Left-sided PICC is again seen, terminating in the mid SVC. The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderate to severely enlarged. Bibasilar opacities have
 increased in there is now a blunting of the costophrenic angles. Findings are
 consistent with small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded. There
 is moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.

 Bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and marked enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette suggest CHF, however underlying consolidation due to
 pneumonia at the lung bases not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
