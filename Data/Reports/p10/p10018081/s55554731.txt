                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Arrhythmia.  Question central line positioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 about 5-6 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach,
 its distal course not fully imaged.  A right internal jugular catheter
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is a new focal opacity in the
 left upper lobe with a geometric appearance, probably compatible with
 atelectasis; a newly forming area of pneumonia is not excluded, however. 
 Dense extensive retrocardiac opacification with air bronchograms and a
 probable associated pleural effusion persists without clear change.  A pleural
 effusion is not apparent on the right on this study, which may be due to a
 true decrease or consequence of differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left upper lobe opacity, probably due to atelectasis, but a
 new focus of infection is not excluded; short-term follow-up radiographs may
 be helpful to help distinguish if clinical concerns may include the
 possibility of developing infection.  Persistent extensive retrocardiac
 opacification, most commonly due to atelectasis, with a pleural effusion.
