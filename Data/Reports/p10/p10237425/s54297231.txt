                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs raising the
 possibility of chronic pulmonary disease, without definite acute focal
 pneumonia.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is again seen, consistent with
 pleural thickening or pleural effusion and some atelectatic changes at the
 bases.
