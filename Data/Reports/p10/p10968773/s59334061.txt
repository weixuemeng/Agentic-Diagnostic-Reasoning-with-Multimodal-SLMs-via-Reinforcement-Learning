 show an increase in interstitial structures, the lateral radiograph shows
 minimal blunting of the dorsal aspect of the costophrenic sinuses, likely
 suggesting minimal pleural effusions.  The size of the cardiac silhouette
 continues to be mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
 
 No new parenchymal abnormalities.  No pneumonia.
