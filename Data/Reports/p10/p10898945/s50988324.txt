 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Patchy

 due to atelectasis although consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.

 Likely lingular atelectasis, underlying pneumonia not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion.
