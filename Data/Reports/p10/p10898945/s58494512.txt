                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with wheezing  // Evidence of aspiration?     
 Evidence of aspiration?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is new. I am not convinced this is due to heart
 failure since heart is not enlarged, and there is no appreciable pleural
 effusion. Lung volumes are lower producing moderate bibasilar atelectasis, but
 there may be even greater opacification at the lung bases, particular the
 left, so I would not exclude aspiration.
