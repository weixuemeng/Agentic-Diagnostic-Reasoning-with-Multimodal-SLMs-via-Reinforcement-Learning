                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates a tortuous aorta with
 questionable prominence of the ascending aortic contour. Heart size is normal.
 Th previously noted right lower lung opacity has largely resolved with minimal
 residual linear opacities evident on the lateral view, likely
 post-inflammatory. There has been interval resolution of the previously
 identified right lower lung opacity.  Multiple calcified nodules identified,
 the largest located in the left upper lung.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tortuous aorta with prominence of ascending aortic contour. If
 clinical conern, could be further evaluated with chest CT. Multiple calcified
 granulomas.
