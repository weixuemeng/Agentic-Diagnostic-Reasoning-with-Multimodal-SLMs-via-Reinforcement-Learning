                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is again a right-sided aortic
 arch, and the aorta is moderately tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, however.  Since prior radiograph, there is a new
 retrocardiac opacity as well as increased mid lung opacity, probably in the
 lingula, worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate setting.  Streaky right
 lower lung opacity is also noted.  A calcified granuloma projects of the left
 upper lobe.  Bilaterally, nipple shadows are visualized.  The chest appears
 hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basiliar opacities concerning for pneumonia. 
 Hyperinflation.
