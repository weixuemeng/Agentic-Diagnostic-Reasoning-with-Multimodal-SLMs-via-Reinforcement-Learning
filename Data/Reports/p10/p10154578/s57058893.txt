  Patchy right basilar opacity suggestive of pneumonia.  Tortuous aorta, seems
  more prominent; when clinically appropriate evaluation is suggested to assess
  for possible aneurysm with chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study includes a PA view only.  The heart is at the upper
 limits of normal size.  Ascending aortic contour is prominent and perhaps
 somewhat greater than on the prior examination, although comparison is
 somewhat limited due to slight differences in orientation.  There is a patchy
 new opacity in the right lower lung, worrisome for pneumonia.  In the left mid
 upper lung, several calcifications suggesting granulomas are present.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lung opacity suggesting pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 2.  Prominent ascending aortic contour, perhaps somewhat increased.  Although
 related in all likelihood due to tortuosity in part, the ascending aorta may
 be dilated and should be evaluated with chest CT when clinically appropriate.
