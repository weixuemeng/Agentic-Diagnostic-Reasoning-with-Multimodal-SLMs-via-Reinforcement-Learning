 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Markedly tortuous thoracic aorta is again noted with
 dilatation of the ascending aorta concerning for aneurysm, overall unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Calcified granulomas are noted
 bilaterally, the largest of which is in the left upper lobe, unchanged. 
 Streaky linear opacities are again noted within the lung bases compatible with
 atelectasis.  Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Tortuous aorta with likely ascending aortic aneurysm,
 unchanged, which can better be assessed with contrast-enhanced CT.  Emphysema.
