                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Hazy opacities overlying the lung
 bases on the frontal projection are likely secondary to soft tissue
 attenuation.  On the lateral view there is a 1.3 cm oval density in the
 retrosternal region of uncertain etiology.  Given the possibility of a
 pulmonary nodule, recommend oblique radiographs for further assessment.  
 There is mild vascular engorgement, though no overt interstial pulmonary edema
 or large pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax
 is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly
 
 2.  1.3 cm nodular density projecting over the retrosternal space on the
 lateral view.  Recommend oblique radiographs to exclude a pulmonary nodule.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings and recommendations to Dr.
 ___ at 8:11 am on ___ by telephone.
