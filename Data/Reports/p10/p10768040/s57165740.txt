 postoperatively.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 09:46 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in
 appearance including the large retrocardiac hiatal hernia.  Bibasilar
 opacities and right mid lung opacities are unchanged.  No interval development
 of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 The raised suspicion for a cavitary lesion in the right mid lung cannot be
 neither excluded nor confirmed on the current examination and evaluation with
 CT might be considered.
