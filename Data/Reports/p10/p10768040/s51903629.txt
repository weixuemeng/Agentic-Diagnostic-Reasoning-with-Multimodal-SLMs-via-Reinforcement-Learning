                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest imaging,
 chest radiograph on ___:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low, more so than on ___, making it
 difficult to interpret the significance of increased opacification at the lung
 bases, particularly the right.  This could be pneumonia.  Lobulated
 mediastinal contours in the midline just above the diaphragm are usually due
 to hiatus hernia, larger than present on ___ or ___.  To
 clarify both tissues, if there is clinical uncertainty, I suggest chest CT
 scanning.
 
 Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal, and there is no pleural
 abnormality.
