 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___'s, status post hip fracture, increased secretions, and

 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is new bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, markedly increased
 compared to the prior study.  There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution.
 There is retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  This most likely represents an infectious
 infiltrate, but CHF cannot be excluded.
