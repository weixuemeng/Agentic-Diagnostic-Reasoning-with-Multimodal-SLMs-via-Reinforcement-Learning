                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal.  Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular configuration.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Streaky opacity within the right lung base may reflect an area
 of atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative changes within the thoracic spine
 are mild.  Calcification is again seen within the left shoulder compatible
 with calcific tendinopathy. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.
