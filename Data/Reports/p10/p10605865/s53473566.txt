                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and cough.  Review of
 medical records also reveals recent completion of antibiotic treatment for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is increased parenchymal opacity in the
 retrocardiac region confirmed on the lateral view.  Elsewhere, lungs are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity compatible with pneumonia.  Given history of
 recent treatment for pneumonia this could potentially be resolving.  However,
 there is no prior exam available for direct comparison of this finding. 
 Repeat exam in several weeks is recommended to document complete resolution.
