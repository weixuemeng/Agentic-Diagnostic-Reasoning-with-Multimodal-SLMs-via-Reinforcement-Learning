 scout view, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours do not appear
 significantly changed.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Pulmonary nodules mentioned in the prior CT report are not visible on this
 study, although a nipple shadow can be visualized on the right.  A small
 quantity of retained contrast within the colon is essentially unchanged.  Mild
 rightward convex curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine with
 small-to-moderate osteophytes.  The bones are probably demineralized to some
