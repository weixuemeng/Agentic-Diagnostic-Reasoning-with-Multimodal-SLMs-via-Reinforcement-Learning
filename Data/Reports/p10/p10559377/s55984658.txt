                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with abdominal distention, prior IV drug use now
 with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a focal opacity in the right upper lobe.  There is background mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema, but improved since prior study, especially in the
 perihilar region.  There are bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. 
 A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position terminating 4.6 cm above the
 carina.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema but there is a more focal
 confluent opacity in the right upper lobe which may represent an infectious
 process in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
