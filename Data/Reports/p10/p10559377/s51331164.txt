                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p intubation with increased bloody secretions
 from ET tube  // interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower, which may be intentional, reflecting lower positive
 pressure support, and this could exaggerate the radiographic severity of lung
 abnormalities, but there has clearly been an increase in the radiodensity of
 the large areas of consolidation in both lower lobes over the past 24 hr. 
 Heart size is top normal and there are no findings to suggest volume overload.
 Worsening infection must be considered.
 
 ET tube standard placement. Sharp definition of the cuff suggests secretions
 are pooling above it.
 
 Bilateral jugular lines and in lower SVC. Nasogastric tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
