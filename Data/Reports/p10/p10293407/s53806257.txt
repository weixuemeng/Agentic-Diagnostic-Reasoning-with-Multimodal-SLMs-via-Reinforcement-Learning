                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer with persistent cough, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased size of a moderate right pleural effusion, which
 may be partially loculated.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 Opacification at the right lung base is similar or slightly increased from
 ___.  No new airspace opacity is seen in the left lung.  The cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The mediastinum remains widened with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and partial calcification of the aortic knob,
 unchanged from prior studies.  Volume loss in the right hemithorax is
 unchanged.  There is persistent gaseous distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of moderate right pleural effusion from ___,
 which may be partially loculated with similar extent of right basilar
 opacification.  In the setting of right-sided volume loss, this most likely
 represents atelectasis; however, superimposed infection is not entirely
 excluded.
