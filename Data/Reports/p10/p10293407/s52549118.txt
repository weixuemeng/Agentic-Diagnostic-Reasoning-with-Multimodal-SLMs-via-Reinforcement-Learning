                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Lung cancer with right upper quadrant pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Volume loss in the right hemithorax is re- demonstrated with persistent
 right-sided pleural thickening and loculated pleural fluid, moderate in
 amount.  The cardiac silhouette size remains borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contour is stable, with numerous mediastinal lymph nodes better assessed on
 the previous CT.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects a
 combination of a dominant right lower lobe lesion, better assessed on the
 previous CT, as well as compressive atelectasis.  Additionally, increased
 interstitial markings in the right lung base are suggestive of lymphangitic
 spread of tumor.  Multiple other smaller pulmonary nodules are noted
 throughout the lungs, but are better assessed on the previous CT.  No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is seen within the left lung.  No
 pneumothorax. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall no significant interval change in comparison to the previous CT. 
 Right-sided pleural thickening and loculated moderate size right pleural
 effusion, unchanged.  Right basilar patchy opacity reflects a combination of
 the dominant right lower lobe lesion and compressive atelectasis.  Increased
 interstitial markings in the right lung base also are compatible with likely
 lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs are
 better seen on the previous CT.
