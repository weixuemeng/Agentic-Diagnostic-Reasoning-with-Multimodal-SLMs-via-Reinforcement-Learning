                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A chest tube remains in place in the right hemithorax, unchanged in
 position.  A moderate-to-large right pneumothorax is similar in size to the
 recent study, and continues to be accompanied by extensive bilateral
 subcutaneous emphysema in the chest, abdomen, and neck.  Additionally,
 pneumomediastinum is present and has slightly increased in extent in the
 interval.  Otherwise, no relevant changes in the chest radiograph since the
 recent study of the same date.
