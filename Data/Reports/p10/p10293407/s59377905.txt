 COMPARISON:  Radiographs obtained a day earlier.
 
 The subcutaneous air collection is substantial, unchanged since the most
 recent radiograph.  Right chest tube appearence is unchanged; most likely
 kincked, not broken.  There is no interval increase in pneumothorax with most
 likely present interval decrease in the pneumothorax seen.  Mediastinal air is
 most likely present.  Lung continues to be consolidated.
