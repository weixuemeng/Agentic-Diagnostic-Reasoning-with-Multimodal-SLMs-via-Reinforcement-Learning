                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with chest tube removal, to assess for fluid
 accumulation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has
 apparently been removed.  Although subcutaneous gas along the lateral chest
 wall extending into the neck somewhat obscures detail in the right apical
 region, no substantial pneumothorax is present at this time.
 
 Opacification at the right base laterally persists, consistent with pleural
 fluid and volume loss in the lower lung.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear, though there is extensive subcutaneous gas
 along the lateral chest wall and extending into the neck on this side as well.
