                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough for a month.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Despite a very large right pleural effusion obliterating most of the right
 lung, mediastinum is not shifted, suggesting that it is fixed in position,
 presumably by extensive tumor, only the upper portion of which is seen along
 the trachea and displacing the right bronchial tree inferiorly.  Left lung is
 clear.  Nurse ___, ___, was notified of these findings by
 telephone at the time of dictation.
