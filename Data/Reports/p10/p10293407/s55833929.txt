 A right PICC line remains in place.  There continues to be extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall and neck soft tissues as well as
 a component of pneumomediastinum which does not appear to be significantly
 changed since ___.  Moderate to large right-sided pneumothorax does not
 appear to be significantly changed although there is increasing opacity

 pleural cavity.  The left lung remains clear.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Continued close imaging followup would be advised.
