                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative day 6 status post exploratory laparotomy with
 resection of GJ anastomosis now with leukocytosis.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right IJ central venous catheter
 terminates in the right atrium.  NG tube terminates in the stomach.  The
 opacification of the left lung base is similar to prior, consistent with a
 moderate sized pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Right middle lobe
 opacity is also similar to prior and consistent with atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable appearance of left pleural effusion with bibasilar opacities most
 consistent with atelectasis.
