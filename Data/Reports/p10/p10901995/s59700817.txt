                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a left-sided PICC line with the tip seen terminating in what
 most likely represents the upper SVC, although the azygos vein cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Redemonstrated is linear atelectasis of the left lower
 lobe, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax identified.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left PICC line terminating probably terminating in the upper SVC.  It should
 be noted that if there is difficulty utilizing this central venous line, the
 possibility that it terminates within the azygous vein should be considered.  
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to ___ via telephone at 14:30 on ___, ___ min after discovery.
