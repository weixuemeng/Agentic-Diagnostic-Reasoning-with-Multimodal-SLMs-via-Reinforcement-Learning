                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of latent TB
 after rifampin and isoniazid therapy and left DCIS (breast) after mastectomy
 with six weeks of cough currently.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  Opacity is projecting
 over the left upper chest, but given the ipsilateral mastectomy, it
 potentially may reflect post-radiation changes.    The findings might
 potentially reflect infectious process, but their similarity with prior
 imaging including chest CT from ___ makes it less likely.
