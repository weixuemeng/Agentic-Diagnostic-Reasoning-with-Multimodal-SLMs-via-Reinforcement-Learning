                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of heart failure with cough, please evaluate for
 pneumonia versus fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  Faint asymmetric increased
 opacification of the right lower and mid lobes compared to the left may be
 positional, though early infectious process cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint increased opacification of right mid and lower lungs may be
 artifactual though cannot exclude early infectious process in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
