                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Upper abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears at the upper limits of normal size, perhaps with
 a prominent left atrial appendage, but unchanged.  There is mild unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 chest is hyperinflated.  New blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may
 suggest a very small pleural effusion, or alternatively, mild atelectasis with
 volume loss.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
