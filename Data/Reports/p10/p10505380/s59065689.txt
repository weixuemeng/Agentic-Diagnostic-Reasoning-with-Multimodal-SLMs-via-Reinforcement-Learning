                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with abdominal pain status post
 nasogastric tube placement.  Confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  A
 nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.  Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise,
 there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal allowing for lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.
