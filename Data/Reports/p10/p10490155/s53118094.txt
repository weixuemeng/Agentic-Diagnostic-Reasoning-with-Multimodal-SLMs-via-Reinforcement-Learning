 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:56 PM
  
  1. In comparison to earlier same-day chest x-ray from 14:55, there has been
  interval retraction of right IJ central line, which now terminates at the
  approximate level of the mid/low SVC.
  2. Otherwise, no additional interval change.  Stable appearance of the
  mediastinal contours and the lungs.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liver transplant  // right IJ line pulled
 back, assess for central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central line terminates at the distal SVC.  The NG tube
 terminates in the stomach however it would need to be advanced 5 cm to move
 all the side ports into the stomach.  A worsening opacity in the right lower
 lobe is likely pleural effusion and consolidation.  The interstitial edema and
 left lower lobe atelectasis is improved.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right IJ central line terminates at the distal SVC.
 2.  The NG tube would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports into
 the stomach.
 3.  A worsening opacity in the right lower lobe is likely pleural effusion and
 consolidation.
