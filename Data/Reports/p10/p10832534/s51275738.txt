                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nonproductive cough for 2 weeks with fever and chills, pain with
 inspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Patchy opacity within the right lung base appears to reflect a
 combination of subsegmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe, best depicted
 on the lateral view, as well as streaky opacity within the right middle lobe
 which is concerning for pneumonia.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky opacity in the right middle lobe which is concerning for pneumonia. 
 Linear opacity within the right lower lobe likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Follow up radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution of these findings.
