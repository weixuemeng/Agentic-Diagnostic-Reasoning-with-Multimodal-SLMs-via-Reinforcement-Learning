                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with anorexia, fatigue, and dyspnea.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal but stable compared
 to prior exam.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 previously described pulmonary vascular congestion has largely improved with
 perhaps slight residual venous hypertension.  The lungs show no definite
 consolidation, although the lung volumes are low.  Patchy lingular opacities
 are probably due to minor atelectasis or scarring without definite change. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are seen
 throughout an osteopenic thoracic spine.  Additionally, severe degenerative
 changes are seen in the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary edema and effusions described on
 ___; no definite evidence for pneumonia.
