                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 pulmonary edema have minimally decreased in severity.  However, there is
 unchanged clear evidence of pulmonary edema.  Better visible than on the
 previous image is a relatively extensive retrocardiac atelectasis.  The
 presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No other
 changes.
