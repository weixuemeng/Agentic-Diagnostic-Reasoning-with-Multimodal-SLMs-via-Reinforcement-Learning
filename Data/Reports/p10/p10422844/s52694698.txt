                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The right
 costophrenic angle is not included on the frontal image.  There is mild
 prominence of the vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Trace
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle suggests trace pleural effusions.
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Multiple old bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
