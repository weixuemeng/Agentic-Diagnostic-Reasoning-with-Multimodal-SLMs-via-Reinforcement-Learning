                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.  History of MAC infection.  Rule out
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 Patient has had right mastectomy.  Atelectasis due to longstanding
 bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe is slightly more pronounced today. 
 Chest CT on ___ showed granulomatous calcifications in right
 hilar lymph nodes and in the right lung and small impactions in dilated
 bronchi, predominantly in the middle lobe.  The impactions and granulomata
 might be responsible for suggestion of two tiny lung nodules projecting over
 the anterior aspect of the right seventh rib that are so small that they could
 have been present previously but not appreciated. Given that treatment for
 breast carcinoma took place approximately ___ years ago, I strongly doubt
 that these tiny nodules, if present at all, are due to intrathoracic
 malignancy  There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of hilar adenopathy. 
 Heart size is normal.  No focal abnormality is seen in the left lung.
