                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Lungs are overexpanded, but without areas of a lobar or segmental
 consolidation or atelectasis.  A linear focus of scar within the lingula is
 unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions.  Note is made of previous right
 mastectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known CT findings suggestive of pulmonary MAC infection are not
 well demonstrated radiographically.  If warranted clinically, CT could be
 performed as it is more sensitive than radiographs for detecting
 bronchiectasis and centrilobular nodules.
