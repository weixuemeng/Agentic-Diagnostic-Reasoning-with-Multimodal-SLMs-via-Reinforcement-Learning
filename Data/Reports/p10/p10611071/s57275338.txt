                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of osteoporosis and breast cancer
 with bone metastases.  Now with right-sided pain.  Evaluation for metastatic
 lesions or rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there is a new rounded density along the
 left lateral chest wall, likely an osseous metastasis, as well as suspicion of
 an osseous lesion arising from the right lateral ribs just above the
 costophrenic sulcus.
 
 The right breast shadow is absent.  The lungs are well inflated and
 essentially clear, with right apical pleural thickening, and no evidence of
 focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of a left lateral chest wall density, likely
 a metastatic lesion arising from the ribs, as well as suspicion of a right
 lateral rib lesion.  Dedicated imaging with CT or nuclear medicine bone scan
 is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were posted to the online critical results
 radiology dashboard by Dr. ___ at 11:45 pm on ___.
