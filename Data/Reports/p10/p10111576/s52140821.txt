                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hyperglycemia  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A vague nodular opacity is seen
 in the right upper lung adjacent to the EKG electrode sticker. While this may
 represent a very tiny focus of pneumonia, followup to resolution is advised.
 Lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific vague nodular opacity in the right upper lung is of uncertain
 etiology.  While this may represent a tiny focus of pneumonia, followup
 radiograph post treatment to ensure resolution.
