                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia and fever  // ?pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. There is substantial interval
 progression of interstitial pulmonary edema currently moderate to severe.
 Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present
 
 Alternatively the findings might represent gradually progression in a typical
 infection, in this case correlation with chest CT would be recommended for
 distinguishing the presumably interstitial pulmonary edema pattern from more
 nodular infectious process
