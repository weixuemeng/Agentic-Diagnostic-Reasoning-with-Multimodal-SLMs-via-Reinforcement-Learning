                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a
 persistent diffuse mild interstitial abnormality.  This appearance suggests
 mild vascular pulmonary edema but is less striking than on the prior
 radiographs.  In addition a lingular opacity is seen in two views but better
 depicted on the frontal view.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Focal opacity in the lingula.  This could be seen with pneumonia but is
 also a common site for atelectasis. Correlation with clinical presentation and
 consideration of short-term follow-up radiographs is suggested.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
