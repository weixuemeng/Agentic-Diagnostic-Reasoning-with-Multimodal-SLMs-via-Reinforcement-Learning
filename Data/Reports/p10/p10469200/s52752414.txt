                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  If there is continued concern for
 infection, then repeat PA view with improved inspiratory effort is suggested.
