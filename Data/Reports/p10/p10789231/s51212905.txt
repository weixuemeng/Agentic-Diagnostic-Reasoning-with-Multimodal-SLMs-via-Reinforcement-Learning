                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with NASH cirrhosis, hepatic sarcoid
 with respiratory distress.  Evaluate for fluid overload, infiltrates and
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement as before.  During the latest interval, a right internal jugular
 approach wide-caliber central venous line has been placed, seen to reach the
 lower SVC just short of entering into the right atrium.  The previously
 described diffuse pulmonary parenchymal densities in the entire right
 hemithorax are still present and have not changed significantly.  Observe that
 the lateral pleural sinuses are free which speaks against significant pleural
 effusion.  The left hemithorax pulmonary parenchymal densities are more marked
 in the upper lobe area resulting now in a rather discrete infiltrate of
 pneumonic character in this area.  This density appears to have progressed
 moderately since the next preceding examination.  The left lower lobe area and
 the retrocardiac space remain relatively free, and again there is no evidence
 of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinus.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of local infiltrate in left upper lobe area, now
 having the appearance of a pneumonic infiltrate.  Diffuse pulmonary changes in
 the right hemithorax rather unchanged.  Plethoric appearance of pulmonary
 vasculature.  No evidence of large pleural effusion on this portable
 single-view chest examination.  The patient may be over hydrated, but it is
 unlikely that dehydration solves the described problems.
