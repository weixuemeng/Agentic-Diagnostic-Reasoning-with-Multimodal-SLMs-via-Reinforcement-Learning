 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes
 remain.  The room right Swan-Ganz catheter has been exchanged for a sheath.
 Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with prominent pulmonary
 edema and layering effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis.  More
 coalescent areas of opacification are seen in the right upper zone and the
 left perihilar region.  Although these could reflect asymmetric edema, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
