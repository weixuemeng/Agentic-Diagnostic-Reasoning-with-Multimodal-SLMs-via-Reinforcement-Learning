                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with amiodarone, evaluate for possible
 amiodarone toxicity.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is seen.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic
 aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on
 the frontal views.  As already seen on the preceding study, there is a mild
 degree of right-sided convex scoliosis in the thoracic spine with moderate
 degree of degenerative changes, but no other skeletal abnormalities are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion or
 interstitial abnormalities suspicious for amiodarone toxicity.
