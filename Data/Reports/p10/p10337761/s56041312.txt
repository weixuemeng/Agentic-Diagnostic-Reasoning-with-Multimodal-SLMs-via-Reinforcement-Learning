                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with HIV, right-sided
 congenital heart failure and recent erythrodermic skin reaction, presents with
 fluid overload for any acute pulmonary condition.
 
 AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged, moderate to severe as well as prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery, findings that might be consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No focal consolidations, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  No definitive pulmonary edema is noted as
 well.
