 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 914 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent but stable layering right effusion with associated airspace
 disease which could reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  Left lung is grossly clear.  The heart remains enlarged which
 could reflect cardiomegaly or a pericardial effusion.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Calcification of the aortic knob suggests atherosclerosis.  No
 pneumothorax.  No left effusion.
