                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 is left upper hemithorax/apical opacity, not significantly changed since the
 prior study, seen to represent loculated pleural effusion on prior CT.  Left
 base streaky opacity radiating from the left hilum is similar in appearance. 
 Hilar contours are similar.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles may
 be due to trace effusions.  Otherwise, the right lung is clear.
