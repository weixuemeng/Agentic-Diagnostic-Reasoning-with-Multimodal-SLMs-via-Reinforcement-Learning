                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Lung cancer.  Question
 pneumonia or effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There has been no significant interval change.  Left
 upper lung rounded opacity is again compatible with loculated pleural
 effusion.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles is also compatible
 with layering effusions bilaterally.  Superimposed streaky opacities at the
 bases, left greater than right, suggestive of atelectasis, noting that
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Left hilar mass is best
 appreciated on prior CTs with most recent from ___.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Loculated fluid at the left lung
 superiorly and trace bilateral effusions.  Superimposed linear opacities at
 the bases suggestive of atelectasis, noting that infection cannot be excluded.
 No significant change since prior.
