                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malignant pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 is greater opacification of the left lower lobe, although a pleural effusion
 in the left lung is probably similar in size.  Increased opacification is
 suspected to primarily reflect increase in associated atelectasis extending
 posteriorly from the left hilum.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar moderate left-sided pleural effusion with greater left
 lower lobe opacification which probably consists mostly of increasing
 associated atelectasis, although areas of loculated fluid are difficult to
 completely exclude.
