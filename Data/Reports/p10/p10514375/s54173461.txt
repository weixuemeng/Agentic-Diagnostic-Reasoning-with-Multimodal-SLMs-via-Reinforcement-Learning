                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of metastatic lung cancer, now
 with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is clear.  The left lung again demonstrates a
 rounded left apical opacity, which is not significantly changed compared with
 prior CT and represents a loculated pleural effusion. Small amount of left
 pleural fluid is also noted at the base in this patient who is status post
 pleurodesis. Left hilar opacity is compatible with known mass, and streaky
 opacity within the left lung base radiating from the hilum is unchanged,
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in loculated left apical pleural
 effusion as well as minor left basilar pleural effusion.  No new consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Ill-defined opacity in the left hilar region is
 compatible with known mass and streaky left basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.
