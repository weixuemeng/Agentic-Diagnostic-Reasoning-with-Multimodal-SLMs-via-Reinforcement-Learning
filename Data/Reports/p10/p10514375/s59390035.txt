                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and malignant pleural
 effusion and pericardial effusion.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large left upper lobe opacity corresponds to the loculated
 effusion.  The combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis on the right
 appears to have increased particularly the pleural effusion component as
 demonstrated by continued shift of the mediastinum to the left.  On the left
 there is likely a small amount of effusion but also predominately atelectasis
 again appreciated due to the left-sided mediastinal shift.  No focal opacities
 concerning for infectious process are present.
