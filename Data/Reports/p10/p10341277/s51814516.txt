                                 FINAL REPORT
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal in appearance on the
 frontal view, but note is made of increased opacity in the infrahilar area on
 the lateral view.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific opacity in infrahilar region on lateral view,
 possibly due to confluence of pulmonary veins accentuated by slight obliquity
 of the patient on this lateral radiograph.  
 
 Recommend initial further evaluation with a repeat lateral view.  If this
 finding persists despite repeating the radiograph, then further evaluation
 with CT would be warranted.
