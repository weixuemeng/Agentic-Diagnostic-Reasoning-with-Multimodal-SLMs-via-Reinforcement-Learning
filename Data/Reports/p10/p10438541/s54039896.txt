                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hepatic encephalopathy, rule out infection 
 // Please assess for pneumonia      Please assess for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion is new, obscuring the left heart border and
 possibly displacing the cardiac silhouette to the right, however the trachea
 is not shifted, and therefore I believe that there is considerable enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Since there is only mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement,  pericardial effusion due to pericarditis is quite likely. 
 Combination of left pleural effusion obscures the left lower lobe, which is
 either atelectatic or consolidated, and should be re-evaluated with chest
 radiographs following thoracentesis or by CT scanning. .
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr.___ ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 12:03 PM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
