                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with multiple GSW intubated on the scene with needle
 thoracostomy performed in field transferred from ___.  // eval IJ placement?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous right pleural effusion and traumatic changes to the superior segment
 of the right lower lobe have improved. The basal segments are still partially
 consolidated, and there is still some adjacent hemo thorax, no larger today.
 There is no pneumothorax, and the small volume of pleural or extrapleural
 bleeding associated with the posterior upper rib fractures is unchanged.  Left
 lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. ET tube and right
 internal jugular line are in standard placements.
 
 The upper enteric drainage tube ends in the mid esophagus would have needed to
 be advanced at least 20 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach, but
 was repositioned as of a chest radiograph performed 05:30 today, available the
 time of this review.
