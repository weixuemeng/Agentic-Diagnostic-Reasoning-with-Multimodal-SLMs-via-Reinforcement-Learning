                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy, presents with leukocytosis
 and diaphoresis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in
 place.  There is a dense retrocardiac opacity and bilateral lung bases which
 could represent atelectasis.  Patchy opacities in the left base likely
 represent atelectasis although infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  Upper lungs are clear.  Thoracic
 aorta is prominent and unfolded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity and retrocardiac opacities likely
 represent atelectasis although supervening infection must be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
