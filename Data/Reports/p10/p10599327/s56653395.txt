                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, chronic UTI and pneumonia with tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient positioning.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard position.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Streaky patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 likely due to low lung volumes.  Trace blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle may suggest the presence of a trace pleural effusion.  No left-sided
 pleural effusion is identified, and there is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine, as well as within the
 right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to patient rotation.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities
 could reflect atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  Possible
 trace right pleural effusion.
