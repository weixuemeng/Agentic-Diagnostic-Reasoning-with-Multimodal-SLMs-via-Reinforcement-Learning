                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube and right PICC remain in unchanged positions.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, although
 infection is difficult to exclude.  Small left pleural effusion is relatively
 unchanged.  Previously noted right pleural effusion appears improved.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
 Percutaneous GJ tube is partially imaged in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities persist, likely atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude.  Persistent small left pleural effusion, and interval
 decrease in size of the right pleural effusion which is likely miniscule.
