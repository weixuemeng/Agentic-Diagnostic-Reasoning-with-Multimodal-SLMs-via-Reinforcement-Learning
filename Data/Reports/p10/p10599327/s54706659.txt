                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy and elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There are patchy increased opacities at both lung bases which could be seen
 with pneumonia although aspiration or atelectasis could be considered.  A
 tracheostomy is in place.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bibasilar opacities, with low lung volumes.  Considerations
 include pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, but atelectasis or even
 aspiration could be considered depending on clinical circumstances.
