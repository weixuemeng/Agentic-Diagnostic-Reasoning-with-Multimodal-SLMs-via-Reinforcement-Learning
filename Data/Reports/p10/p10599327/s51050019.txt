                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CDA with leukocytosis and hypotension, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there may be some mild
 engorgement with poor definition of lower lung vessels, suggesting some
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply
 seen, suggesting some improved aeration at the right base.  Patchy
 opacifications at the bases most likely reflect atelectasis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
