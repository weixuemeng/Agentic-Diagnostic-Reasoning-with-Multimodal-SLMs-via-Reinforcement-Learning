 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, past medical history of congenital
 heart disease including ASD and small VSD.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.   
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of consolidation,
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly with left ventricular and left atrial enlargement likely related
 to patient's congenital heart disease.  The main pulmonary artery is not
 enlarged.  Lower thoracic vertebral bodies superiorly is partially fused with
 no clear intervertebral disc space and probable single pedicle on the right. 
 Additional narrowed intervertebral disc more superiorly may also be
 congenital.  There is evidence of prior left midclavicular fracture.Osseous
 structures are otherwise unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly compatible with patient's history without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
