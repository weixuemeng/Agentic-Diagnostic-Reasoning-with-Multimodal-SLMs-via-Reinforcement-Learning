                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged including a prominent main pulmonary
 artery contour and/or left atrial appendage in addition to overall mild
 cardiomegaly.  Prominent central pulmonary arteries appear unchanged on the
 lateral view.  Streaky opacity at the left lung base suggests atelectasis. 
 The lungs appear otherwise clear. There are very small probable bilateral
 pleural effusions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Cardiomegaly and
 prominent central pulmonary arteries, as before.
