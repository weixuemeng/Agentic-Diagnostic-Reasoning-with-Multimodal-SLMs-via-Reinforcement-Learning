                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman postop day 3 status post L4-S1 anterior fusion,
 now with fever, tachycardia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Lungs are clear. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 structures are normal. Pleural surfaces are normal.  Rounded density overlying
 the right hemidiaphragm is likely a nipple shadow, however conventional
 radiograph with nipple markers is recommended when patient is stable. Old
 healed fracture is noted in the lateral right fourth rib. Calcific density in
 the left neck is likely vascular calcifications in the internal carotid artery
 versus a calcified node.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No pneumonia.
 2. Right lower lung rounded density, likely a nipple shadow. However,
 conventional radiograph with nipple markers is recommended when patient is
 stable.
 3. Probable internal carotid artery dense calcification.
