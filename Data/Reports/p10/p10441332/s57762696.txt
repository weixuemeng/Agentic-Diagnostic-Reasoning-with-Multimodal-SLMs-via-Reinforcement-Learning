 EXAMINATION:  Chest two views
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall and L rib pain  // ? rib fx, ? acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest. Focal opacity at the left costophrenic
 angle maybe due to atelectasis or adjacent fat pad. The lungs are otherwise
 clear and there is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in configuration and in part likely due to prominent mediastinal fat.
 Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted as well as
 coronary artery stents. Degenerative changes noted at the shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. If desired, dedicated rib series can be
 performed.
