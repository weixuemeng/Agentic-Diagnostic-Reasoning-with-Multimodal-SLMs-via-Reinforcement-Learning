                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with wheeze, h/o chf   copd  // r/o
 infiltrate/vol overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating between ___ and
 ___ chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been previous median sternotomy.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in size.  Aorta is diffusely tortuous and both the ascending and
 descending regions.  Enlargement of central pulmonary vasculature suggestive
 of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  In addition to these vascular findings,
 cardiomediastinal widening is in part due to excessive mediastinal fat
 deposition, mediastinal lipomatosis.  Apparent sub cm nodular opacity is
 present in the right upper lung at the intersection of the right third
 anterior and seventh posterior ribs.  Of note, a smaller nodule was present in
 this region on older chest CTA of ___.  Lungs are hyperexpanded but
 grossly clear except for linear scarring at the bases.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized.  Healed right rib fractures are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with COPD and probable pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Stable cardiac enlargement without evidence of congestive heart failure.
 
 Possible small right upper lobe lung nodule, for which chest CT is recommended
 for confirmation and further characterization.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:
 
 CHEST CT TO CONFIRM AND CHARACTERIZE A SMALL PULMONARY NODULE.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 13:32 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
