                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with trapped lung after
 decortication.
 
 Portable radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval re-expansion of the right lung with still present right
 pneumothorax, predominantly at the very apex and very base of the lung.  Three
 chest tubes are in place.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  The exact
 position of the tip of the ET tube is unclear, most likely just about the
 carina and should be re-positioned.
