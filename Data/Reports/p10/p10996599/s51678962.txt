                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right thoracotomy, decortication.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Right hemithorax appearance is
 unchanged.  There is minimal apical pneumothorax suspected, grossly unchanged
 since the prior study, but no substantial increase after removal of the chest
 tube is demonstrated.  Pleural effusion, loculated is unchanged in appearance
 as well.
