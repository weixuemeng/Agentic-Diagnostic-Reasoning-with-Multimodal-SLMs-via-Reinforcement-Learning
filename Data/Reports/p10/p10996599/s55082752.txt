                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  The degree of
 pleural fluid is less prominent than on the previous study, and there are
 streaks of atelectasis at the left base.  The right lung is essentially clear,
 as is the upper portion of the left lung.
