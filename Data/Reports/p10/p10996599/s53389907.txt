                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a right VATS decortication.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 4:55 a.m.:
 
 Tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged, small multifocal right pleural
 collection is larger, particularly in the upper aspect of the right major
 fissure, following removal of the most lateral of three right pleural drains,
 two of which persist at the base and medially.  Severe bibasilar atelectasis
 is unchanged.  Left upper lung is clear.  Mediastinum is normal.  Enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is most likely due to paramediastinal pleural
 effusion.
 
 Substantial intestinal distention is seen in the imaged portion of the upper
 abdomen.
