                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough, right-sided chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle opacities
 in the lower lungs may represent atelectasis, though cannot exclude a very
 early pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, most compatible with atelectasis, though an
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
