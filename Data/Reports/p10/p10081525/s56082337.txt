 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are increasing opacities in the
 left lower lobe, consistent with worsening loss of volume in the left lower
 lobe.  Small-to-moderate left effusion has minimally increased.  The right
 lung is better expanded.  There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
