                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of multiple rib fractures
 after trauma.  Compare with next previous chest examination for any
 improvement or change in lung findings.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding two chest examinations
 of ___ and ___.
 
 The heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta
 mildly widened and elongated but without local contour abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The on next previous examination
 identified temporarily increased pleural effusion that blunted the left
 lateral pleural sinus and extended into the posterior pleural spaces has now
 decreased markedly and only a very mild peripheral blunting of the lateral
 pleural sinus remains.  Also the appearance of the crowded pulmonary
 vasculature on the previously existing left lower lobe atelectasis has
 normalized with the exception of a few peripheral linear scar formations, the
 findings are now unremarkable.  When comparison is extended to the chest
 examinations of ___, there was indeed a temporary increase of
 the pleural effusion on examination of ___.  There is no evidence
 of new changes in the previously described rib fractures and on the frontal
 view can identify several non-displaced rib fractures.  No radiographic
 detectable callus formation present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normalization of pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis
 related to previous trauma.
