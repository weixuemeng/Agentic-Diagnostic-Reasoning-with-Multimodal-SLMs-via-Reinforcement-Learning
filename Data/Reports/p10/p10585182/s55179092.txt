                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, cough, dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A severe
 dextroscoliosis of the T-spine is present which somewhat limits the
 evaluation.  There is mild prominence of the left pulmonary hilum with left
 perihilar linear density likely representing scarring in this patient with
 prior pneumonia in this region.  There is no new consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is difficult to assess due to severe scoliosis,
 though appears grossly stable.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left mid lung scarring likely sequelae of old infection.  No
 evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  Dextroscoliotic T-spine.
