                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  This is a ___F with history of sCHF with EF of ___% and history
 of infiltrating ductal carcinoma s/p partial mastectomy and chemo and RTX, as
 well as history of asthma and multiple PNA in the past ___ years who presents
 with hypoxia and tachypnea  // evaluate for change in pulmonary edema and any
 consolidation   evaluate for change in pulmonary edema and any consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 The large area of consolidation in the right upper lobe developed between
 ___, along with a similar area in the perihilar
 left lung and worsened subsequently.  Both areas were still abnormal on ___ when the patient also had mild pulmonary edema elsewhere in the lungs. 
 Subsequently edema has improved, and so has the consolidation, particularly in
 the perihilar left lung.  The sequence of changes is extremely unusual ; I do
 not think these areas of recurrent pneumonia as referenced.  Perhaps these are
 areas of lung injury from radiation or drug toxicity and have an lower
 threshold for edema than the rest of the lungs.  Pattern is not consistent
 with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis or malignancy.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are still
 present.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
 
 Supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends in the low SVC.
