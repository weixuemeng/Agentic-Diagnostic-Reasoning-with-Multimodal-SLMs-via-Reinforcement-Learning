 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There has been the
 development of moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral basilar opacifications
 consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis. The given the
 extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be
 difficult to exclude a superimposed infection, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 The right jugular catheter has been removed.  The remaining right PICC line
 now has its tip within the right atrium.
