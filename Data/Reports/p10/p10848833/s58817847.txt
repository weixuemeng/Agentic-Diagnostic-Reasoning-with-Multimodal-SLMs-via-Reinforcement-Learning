                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubated.  // eval for tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:
 Film from earlier the same day at 07:43.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Single supine view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 ET tube tip is 5.3 cm from the carina. There is increased opacity with in the
 right hemithorax suggestive of layering effusion with bilateral pulmonary
 vascular congestion. More dense retrocardiac opacity is noted, potentially
 atelectasis in setting of low lung volumes. There is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette likely accentuated by technique. Prominence of the upper
 mediastinum may also be due to positioning although correlation regarding need
 for CT suggested.
