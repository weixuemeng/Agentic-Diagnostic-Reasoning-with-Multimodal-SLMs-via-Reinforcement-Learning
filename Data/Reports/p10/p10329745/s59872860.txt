                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:30 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is worsened.  Upper lobe vascular engorgement has improved,
 but there is new perihilar consolidation in the right mid and lower lung
 zones, raising possibility of recent aspiration.  Subsequent chest
 radiographs, however, showed worsening pulmonary edema.  ET tube in standard
 placement.  Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium, and nasogastric
 tube is looped in the stomach.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion is small,
 if any.
