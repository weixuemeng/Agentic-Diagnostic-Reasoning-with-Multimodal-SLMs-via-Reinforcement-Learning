                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a PET-CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 atelectasis at the left lung base which likely also is associated with small
 effusion as seen on prior CT-PET.  Coarsened reticular nodular markings within
 the lungs likely represent chronic change.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarsened markings likely reflect chronic disease with left basal
 atelectasis and small effusion again noted.
