                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath
 and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is wedge-shaped
 opacification at the right costophrenic angle; differential diagnosis includes
 infection versus pulmonary infarct.  This finding is not well seen on the
 lateral view.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Wedge-shaped opacity at the right costophrenic angle could be due
 to consolidation due to infection or pulmonary infarct, less likely pleural
 fluid; not well seen on the lateral view.  Chest CT is pending.
