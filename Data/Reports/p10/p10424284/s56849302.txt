                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been some decrease in
 the previously described left basilar pneumonia.  However, a substantial
 residual persists.  Followup in another four weeks should be obtained to
 ensure complete clearing.  If clearing is not achieved at this time, CT should
 be considered to assess for a possible endobronchial obstructing lesion.
