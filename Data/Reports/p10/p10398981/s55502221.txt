 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:09 PM
  Widespread bilateral airspace opacities persist and appear slightly more
  confluent in the right lung compared to the prior study.  This is also
  accentuated by lower lung volumes on the current exam.  There is no evidence
  of pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxmia  // eval for pneumothorax     
 eval for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 04:34.
 
 Very severe global consolidation of both lungs as progressed continuously
 since ___, more severe now than earlier in the day.  The rapid change
 suggests this is largely edema, but there may be small nodular opacities in
 the lungs, perhaps cavitated, raising the possibility of disseminated sepsis.
 
 Given such low lung volumes, heart is probably normal size.  Pleural effusion
 is presumed, but not substantial.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is no more 2 cm from the carina and should not be
 advanced.
