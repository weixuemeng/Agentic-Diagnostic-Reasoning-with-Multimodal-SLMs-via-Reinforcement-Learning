                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure and new low
 grade fever // Eval for infiltrate vs. interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT chest on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with chest radiograph on ___, a right basilar opacity is
 slightly worsened, and there has been interval slight increase in pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  There is continued bibasilar
 atelectasis and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to
 prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior.
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina.  A left
 IJ central catheter terminates in the right atrium.  A right-sided central
 catheter terminates in the low SVC.  An enteric tube passes below the level of
 the diaphragm and terminates in the stomach.   Again seen is high density
 contrast agent over the gastric fundus, may reflect prior sclerotherapy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in the right basilar opacity, may represent pneumonia
 versus atelectasis
 2. Interval slight increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 interstitial edema compared with prior.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 similar to prior.
 3. An ET tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the diaphragm, and could be
 advanced 1-2 cm for more secure positioning.
 4. Bibasilar atelectasis, similar to prior.
