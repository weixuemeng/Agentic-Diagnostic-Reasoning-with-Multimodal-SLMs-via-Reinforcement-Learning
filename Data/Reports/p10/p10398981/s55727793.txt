                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o cirrhosis and UGIB s/p intubation now
 with worsening hypoxia.  // Eval for pneumonia (?aspiration) vs. pulmonary
 edema vs. other process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 SINCE THE RECENT STUDY OF EARLIER TODAY, SUPPORT AND MONITORING DEVICES REMAIN
 IN STANDARD POSITION AND CARDIOMEDIASTINAL CONTOURS ARE STABLE. IN ADDITION TO
 WORSENING BILATERAL RETROCARDIAC OPACIFICATION, NEW MULTIFOCAL REGIONS OF
 AIRSPACE OPACIFICATION ARE PRESENT BILATERALLY, WITH RIGHT LUNG INVOLVEMENT
 MORE THAN LEFT.  ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH A COMPONENT MAY REFLECT PULMONARY EDEMA IN
 THE SETTING OF BILATERAL SEPTAL LINES, SUPERIMPOSED SECONDARY PROCESS SUCH AS
 MULTIFOCAL ASPIRATION IS LIKELY.
