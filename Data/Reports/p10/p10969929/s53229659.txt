                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pancreatic mass, malaise  // r/o pna, mass
 r/o pna, mass
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 3 cm wide soft tissue shadow projecting over the left lower chest at the level
 of the anterior fifth rib is not identifiable on the lateral view with
 certainty, but raises concern for any lung mass.  There is no prior chest for
 abdomen CT available for inspection.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal.  Coronary calcification
 projects posterior to the aortic valve on the lateral view.  There is no good
 evidence for central lymph node enlargement.  Small regions of possible right
 pleural thickening are unrelated to a possible lung nodule or pancreatic mass.
 .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Any recent chest or abdomen CT scan should be evaluated
 for possibility of a 3 cm left lung nodule.  If no such CT is available or if
 the nodule remains equivocal, conventional chest CT should be performed.
