                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New PICC line on the right is projecting with its tip somewhere in
 the mediastinum.  Appears to cross the midline, there is concern for potential
 arterial location.  The initial line concerns were communicated over the
 telephone at the time of the wet read.  Repeat PA and lateral radiograph,
 taken approximately an hour after the radiograph demonstrated the PICC line in
 the mid SVC.  Potential small right pleural effusion.  Stable moderate
 cardiomegaly.
