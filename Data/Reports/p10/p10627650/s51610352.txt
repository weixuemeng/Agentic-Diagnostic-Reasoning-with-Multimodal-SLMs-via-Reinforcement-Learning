                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, dyspnea, suggest fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and in an almost globular configuration.
 Correlate with concern for mild pericardial effusion.  Surgical clips are
 noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.  Mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette and a possibly globular configuration, correlate with
 concern for pericardial effusion although if such would be small.
