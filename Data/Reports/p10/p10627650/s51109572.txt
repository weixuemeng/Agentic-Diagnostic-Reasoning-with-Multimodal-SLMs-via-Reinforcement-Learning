                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left lower lobe opacity on KUB.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion which is now moderate
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying left basilar consolidation is not
 excluded.  There is also a patchy right basilar opacity and blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small right pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis, consolidation is not excluded.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in now moderate left pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. 
 Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, better assessed on immediately
 preceding abdomen/pelvis CT.
