                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cirrhosis, portal hypertension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but similar
 to the previous examination.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with similar enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle persists, potentially reflective of a trace
 right pleural effusion.  No left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis and possible trace right pleural
 effusion.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
