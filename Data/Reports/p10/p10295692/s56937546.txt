                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with massive volume right effusion s/p pigtail
 placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 22:42.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pigtail catheter has been placed in the interim with its tip
 projecting over the lateral aspect of the right lower hemithorax.  The
 previously demonstrated large pleural effusion has subsequently decreased in
 size, now moderate.  There is probably a large associated degree of relaxation
 atelectasis as the cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the right.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  There is extensive air under the left hemidiaphragm
 which appears to lie within the stomach.  No left pleural effusion.  The left
 lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Marked decrease in the size of the right pleural effusion, now moderate
 after placement of a pigtail catheter.
 2.  Substantial right lower lung atelectasis.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
