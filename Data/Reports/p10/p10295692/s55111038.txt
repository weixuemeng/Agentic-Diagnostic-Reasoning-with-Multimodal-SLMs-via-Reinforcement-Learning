                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion, now s/p chest tube
 removal.  // Is there any interval change or PTX?      Is there any interval
 change or PTX?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest tube has
 been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The moderate pleural
 effusion at the right base is essentially unchanged.  In the absence of
 mediastinal shift, this implies substantial volume loss in the right lower
 lung.  The left lung is essentially clear.
