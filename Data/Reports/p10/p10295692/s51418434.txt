                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, dullness on R lung base  // ? Acute
 cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with just a small
 amount of aeration seen at the medial right apex.  The left lung is clear.  No
 left pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right aspect of
 the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are difficult to assess due to the
 large opacification over the right hemi thorax.  The left sided borders of the
 heart and mediastinum are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete opacification of the right hemithorax with just a small amount
 of aeration at the medial right apex, likely due to underlying pleural
 effusion and overlying atelectasis.  The mediastinum is shiftly slightly to
 the left.
