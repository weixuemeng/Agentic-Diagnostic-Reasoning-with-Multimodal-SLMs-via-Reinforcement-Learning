                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and weakness, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Linear opacities
 in the bilateral mid and lower lungs could represent plate-like atelectasis or
 scarring.  No definite signs of pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Overall, heart and mediastinal contour appears stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear densities in the bilateral mid and lower lungs, most
 compatible with atelectasis or scarring.
