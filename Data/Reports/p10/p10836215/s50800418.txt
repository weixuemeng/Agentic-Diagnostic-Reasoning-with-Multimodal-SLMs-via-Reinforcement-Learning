                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever, on
 hemodialysis, recent line pulled, feels generally weak with worsening back
 pain and murmur, spinal epidural abscess?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of right-sided dialysis catheter.  Bibasilar opacities
 are seen raising concern for infection/pneumonia.  There are relatively low
 lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is lingular
 and lower lobe atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 Underlying mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities raise concern for infection.
 2.  Epidural abscess cannot be excluded on this study as it is inappropriate
 for evaluation of such and if clinical concern, MRI would be the study of
 choice.
