                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent being a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of
 mild-to-moderate increased in central pulmonary pressure.  Additionally, there
 is silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a small pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette appears moderately
 enlarged. The lungs are otherwise without a focal consolidation.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with left pleural effusion and
 prominence of central pulmonary vasculature suggestive of acute heart failure.
