                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Severe right shoulder pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is faint opacity in the
 right apex, most likely representing summation of shadows but given the
 presence of severe pain, correlation with chest CT is required.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
