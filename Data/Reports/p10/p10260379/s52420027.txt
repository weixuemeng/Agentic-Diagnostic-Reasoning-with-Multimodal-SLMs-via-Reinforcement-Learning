                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with replaced NGtube  // NGtube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided internal jugular port terminates in the mid to distal SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  The left
 basal airspace opacity is similar in extent when compared to the earlier study
 and remain suspicious for a developing pneumonia.  The right lung appears
 grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.  No free air seen under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm, in the stomach.
 
 Similar to slightly worsening airspace opacity at the left lung base
 consistent with developing pneumonia.
