                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CVL  // eval line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest film.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside CT of the chest and radiograph of
 the chest obtained at ___ earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A central venous line in the right neck terminates at the level of the
 confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart size is normal. Apparent
 prominence of the right hilus on this frontal projection is likely due to
 right middle lobe opacity as seen on the prior outside chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right central venous line in place, as described above, with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Focal right middle lobe opacity.
