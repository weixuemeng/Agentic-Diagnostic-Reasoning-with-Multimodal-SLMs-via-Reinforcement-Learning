                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible hepatic abscess history with increasing liver function
 tests andhypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates within the right atrium, similar compared to the
 previous exam.  There is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Atelectatic changes are noted in
 the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively
 unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 The heart size is unchanged and within normal limits.  There are
 calcifications of the aortic knob.  Biliary stents and clips are again
 demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little interval change compared to the previous exam.  Continued marked
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with small bilateral pleural effusions
 and bibasilar atelectasis.  Right PICC tip terminates in the right atrium, and
 should be withdrawn slightly for optimal positioning.
