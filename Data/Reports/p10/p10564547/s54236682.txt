                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Diffuse body aches.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is borderline in size with a left ventricular configuration.  The
 aorta appears calcified.  There are probably trace bilateral effusions.  
 
 An opacity involves the right upper lung and posterior upper and lower lungs
 on the lateral view, probably correlating with pneumonia involving the right
 upper lobe and possibly the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  It is
 difficult to exclude some component of pneumonia at the lung bases, although
 streaky opacities in those areas may be more attributable to atelectasis.  
 
 The bones appear demineralized.  The left humeral head shows extensive bone
 destruction with a mixed lytic and sclerotic appearance, not fully assessed
 here although possibly post-traumatic, including a large loose body projecting
 below the coracoid.  Moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the
 upper thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia.  Chronic-appearing but only
 partly visualized left shoulder deformity.
