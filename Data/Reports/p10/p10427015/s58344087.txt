                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The superior mediastinum appears
 slightly prominent, although likely related to AP technique and possible
 underlying mediastinal lipomatosis.
