                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for presence of pneumonia in patient with multiple dog
 bites.  Also, evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of radiographs from ___ dating back to the
 admission radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new
 uniform opacity overlying the middle and lower right lung fields, through
 which normal bronchopulmonary structures can be seen.  A more dense opacity at
 the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, and probably
 represents atelectasis.  Stable, minimal widening of the mediastinum results
 from mediastinal vascular engorgement.  Minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement
 is also unchanged.  The heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  An
 endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.4 cm above the carina.  The right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is appropriately positioned and
 unchanged.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field
 of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible new right pleural effusion.  Less likely, this could represent
 uniform lower lobe collapse.  It is suggested that the patient be treated
 empirically with chest PT.  These two possibilities may be differentiated by
 performing a right lateral decubitus chest radiograph to demonstrate fluid
 layering, or bedside ultrasound.
 
 2.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting mild elevation
 of central venous pressures.
 
 3.  Persistent atelectasis at the left lung base.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, pneumonia in this location cannot be excluded.
