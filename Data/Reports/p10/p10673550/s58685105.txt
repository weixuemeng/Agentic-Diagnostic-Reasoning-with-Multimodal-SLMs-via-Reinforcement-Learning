                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is markedly tortuous with the
 ascending aorta appearing aneurysmally dilated.  The hilar contours are
 normal, and the pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs appear hyperinflated. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 displaced fractures are seen.  Extensive degenerative changes of the right
 glenohumeral joint are noted.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is seen, with multilevel degenerative changes visualized in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute intrathoracic injury identified.
 
 2. Markedly tortuous aorta with aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta. 
 This can be further assessed with a dedicated chest CTA.
