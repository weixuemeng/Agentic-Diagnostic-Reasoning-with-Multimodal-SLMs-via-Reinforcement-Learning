 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left-sided chest pain radiating down the
 left arm.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Known bilateral pulmonary
 nodules are better seen on chest CT.  Biapical scarring is again noted.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated but clear of consolidation or effusion.  Linear left
 basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis or scarring.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Continued followup of
 pulmonary nodules is recommended per recent chest CT report.
