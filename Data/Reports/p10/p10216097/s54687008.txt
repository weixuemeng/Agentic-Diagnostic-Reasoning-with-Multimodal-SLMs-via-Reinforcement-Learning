 and 3x chest tubes. Anterior chest tube now removed.  // Eval post chest tube

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the anterior chest tube has
 been removed.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Increasing opacification at the
 right base is consistent with effusion and atelectasis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered. Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette process.
