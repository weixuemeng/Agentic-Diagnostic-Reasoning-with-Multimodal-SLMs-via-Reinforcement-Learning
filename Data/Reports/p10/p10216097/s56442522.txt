                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS decortication with basilar ___ drain.
 Please perform ___ AM  // Routine evaluation for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the drain along the base of the right lung. There is minimal
 atelectasis. Equivocal trace pneumothorax at the right lung apex. Previously
 seen lucency at right lung base is no longer visualized.
 
 New on today's exam, there is an ellipsoid opacity in the right mid zone. This
 is partly accounted for by the overlying scapular angle. Doubt pneumonic
 consolidation.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly increased. Upper zone redistribution is also
 slightly more pronounced. No gross left effusion.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lung base drain remains in place. Minimal , if any, residual
 pneumothorax.
 2. Upper zone redistribution bibasilar atelectasis slightly increased. No
 overt CHF.
 3. Ovoid opacity right mid lung -- question artifact due to overlying scapula.
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
