                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right multiloculated pleural effusion in the
 setting of recent thoracentesis c/b hemothorax now s/p VATS  // please
 evaluate right pleural effusion for possible IP intervention     please
 evaluate right pleural effusion for possible IP inter
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again
 there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively
 mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure, raising the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Opacification in the right mid lung is
 again consistent with loculated pleural effusion. If the condition of the
 patient permits, a lateral view would allow better definition of the pleural
 collection.
