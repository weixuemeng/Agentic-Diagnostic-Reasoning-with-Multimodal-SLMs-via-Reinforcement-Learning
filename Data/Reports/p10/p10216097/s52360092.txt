                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent VATS for hemothorax now with new
 hemoptysis.  // Is there a new process in the lung?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, a small right apical pneumothorax is similar to
 prior study.  Hazy increased opacity with oblique orientation A in the right
 mid lung probably represents loculated pleural fluid. New patchy right
 retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely
 developing pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
