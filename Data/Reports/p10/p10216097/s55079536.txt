                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemothorax with multiple chest tubes. Evaluate for change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Three chest tubes are unchanged in position. No definite pneumothorax is
 identified. There has been improved aeration at the right base, likely due to
 improved atelectasis. A small amount of right pleural fluid remains, though
 has decreased since the prior exam. Subcutaneous air along the right chest
 wall is likely from the recent chest tube insertions.
 
 There is mild left basilar atelectasis and a tiny left pleural effusion. Since
 the prior exam, vascular congestion has slightly worsened. There is no
 evidence of pneumonia. No left pneumothorax is identified. The mediastinal
 contours are normal. The cardiac silhouette is significantly enlarged, and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improved aeration at the right base, likely due to decreased atelectasis
 and a slightly decrease in the amount of residual pleural fluid.
 2.  Slight interval worsening of mild vascular congestion.
 3.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette, which is presumably due to cardiomegaly,
 though a pericardial effusion cannot be completely excluded.
