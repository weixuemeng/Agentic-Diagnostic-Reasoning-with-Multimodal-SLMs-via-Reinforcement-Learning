 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. The
 tip of the Swan-___ catheter again extends into the right pulmonary artery
 beyond the mediastinal border. Loculated pleural effusion within the major
 fissure on the right is essentially unchanged. Moderate enlargement of the

 suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is again noted.
