  Bilateral increased lower lung streaky opacities are most likely atelectasis,
  increased slightly from the prior exam, corresponding to slightly lower lung
  volumes in the interim.  The medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is now
  indistinct.  This is also probably from atelectasis, however concurrent
  pneumonia and cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical scenario.
