                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:19 A.M., ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with glioblastoma.  Coughing eating.  Question
 aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  Right infrahilar pulmonary opacification is
 most likely atelectasis, but whether this is due to aspiration is
 radiographically indeterminate.  Upper lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 exaggerated by low lung volumes and partially obscured by the elevated
 hemidiaphragm but probably larger today than on ___ accompanied by
 increased mediastinal diameter suggesting venous distention due to elevated
 central venous pressure or volume.  There is no pulmonary edema, appreciable
 pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
