                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lung volumes are markedly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Evaluation of the lateral
 projections is limited by the patient's arm positioning.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The heart size is likely within normal limits.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study secondary to very low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation or acute process in the chest.
