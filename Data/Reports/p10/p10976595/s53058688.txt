                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain status post esophageal ablation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are low but clear.  There is
 no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or
 overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may
 reflect pleural thickening.  No large pleural effusions are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect
 pleural thickening vs a very trace pleural effusion.  No large pleural
 effusions are evident.
