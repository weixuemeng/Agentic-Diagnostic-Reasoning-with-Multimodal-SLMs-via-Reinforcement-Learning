                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with asthma exacerbation, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimal increased opacity at left lung base is probably due to superimposition
 of breast tissue rather than pneumonia.  Right lung is unremarkable. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Minimal left lower lobe opacity is probably due to superimposition of breast
 tissue.  Standard PA and lateral views may be helpful to exclude a pneumonia
 in this region, if warranted clinically.
