 FINDINGS:  There are slightly decreased lung volumes.  There is a subtle
 opacity overlying the medial right lung base, which most likely reflects
 overlying breast tissue.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:   Subtle opacity overlying the medial right lung base, which most
