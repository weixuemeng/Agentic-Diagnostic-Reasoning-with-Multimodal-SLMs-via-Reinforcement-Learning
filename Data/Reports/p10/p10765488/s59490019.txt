 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:45 PM
  A right chest port is again seen in stable position with distal tip projecting
  over the right atrium.  Again seen are low lung volumes by suboptimal
  inspiratory effort.  There is unchanged mild enlargement of the cardiac
  silhouette.  Diffuse, centrally predominant interstitial prominence is
  compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion and likely mild pulmonary edema.
  A small to moderate right pleural effusion is again noted.  A trace left
  pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Retrocardiac opacification is
  unchanged, likely reflective of relaxation atelectasis.  There is no
  pneumothorax.
