 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMH of rheumatic mitral stenosis, AFib s/p PVI ___, CKD
 ___ mebranous nephropathy following by transplant surgyer p/w shortness of
 breath found to be hypoxic, in AF RVR, with likely combination of pulmonary
 infiltrates and edema.   // please assess for plumonary edema/pleural
 effusion, pericardial effuision   please assess for plumonary edema/pleural
 effusion, pericard
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall
 change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Again there is increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe
 and pleural effusion. Prominence of the right hilum persists. The curvilinear
 opacification extending from the hilum to the periphery is again seen,
 possibly slightly more prominent.
