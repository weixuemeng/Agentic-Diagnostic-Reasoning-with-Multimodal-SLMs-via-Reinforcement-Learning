                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision, unrestrained, struck chest on steering
 wheel with chest wall pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal. Rightward deviation of the
 cervical trachea may be due to a left sided thyroid nodule or goiter.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Linear opacities
 in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No displaced fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis within the lung bases.  No displaced fractures
 identified. Rightward deviation of the cervical trachea may be due to a left
 thyroid nodule or goiter and clinical correlation is recommended.
