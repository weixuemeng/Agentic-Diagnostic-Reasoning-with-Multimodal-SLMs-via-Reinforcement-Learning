                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dizziness.  Evaluate for evidence of
 mediastinal widening, or cardiac pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Otherwise, no focal opacities are noted.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic and
 stable.  Again seen is increased opacity of the periphery of the right lung
 base laterally underlying rib deformities suggestive of prior trauma and
 underlying scarring which is unchanged.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle is compatible with prominent extrapleural fat confirmed by
 prior CT scan.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable
 cardiomegaly and right lung base scarring.
