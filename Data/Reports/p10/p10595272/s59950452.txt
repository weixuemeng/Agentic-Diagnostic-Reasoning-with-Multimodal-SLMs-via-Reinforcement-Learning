 EXAMINATION:  And
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cold symptoms for 1 week, acute shortness

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is atelectasis at the right lung base.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  Persistent pleural and parenchymal scarring at the right lung
 base.  .  There is mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Chronic pleural and parenchymal scarring at right lung base.  This
 baseline abnormality and superimposed dense breast tissue limited assessment

 standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be recommended.
