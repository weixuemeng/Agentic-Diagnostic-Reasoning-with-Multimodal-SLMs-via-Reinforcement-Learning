                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrently obtained chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume without pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly and linear left basal atelectasis is
 noted.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci posteriorly bilaterally is likely
 due to fatty Bochdalek hernias seen on concurrent CT.  Lateral pleural based
 right lung opacity is unchanged.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged
 with mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  Infectious findings on concurrent
 chest CT are not well depicted on this examination.
