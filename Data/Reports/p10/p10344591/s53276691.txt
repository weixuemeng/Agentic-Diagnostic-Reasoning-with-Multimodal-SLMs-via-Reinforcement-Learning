                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 is stable on the frontal view without evidence of pleural effusion on the
 lateral view.  There is anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction, stable since the prior study.  Partially imaged
 metallic surgical hardware is seen in the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary process.  No
 significant interval change.
