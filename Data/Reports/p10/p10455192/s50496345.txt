  No pneumothorax.  Very low lung volumes likely accentuates pulmonary vascular
  congestion.  Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and opacity at the
  left lower lobe.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after bronchoscopy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.  The left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.  There
 is interval progression of pulmonary edema, moderate to severe, associated
 with bilateral pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Of note is that the low lung volumes might potentially accentuate the presence
 of the severity of vascular congestion, but interval worsening of pulmonary
 edema might potentially be present.
