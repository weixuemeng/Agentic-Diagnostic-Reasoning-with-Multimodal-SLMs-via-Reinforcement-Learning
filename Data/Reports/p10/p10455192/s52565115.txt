                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric
 tube in passes into the stomach although its tip is not visible, lying beyond
 the inferior margin of the imaged field of view. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are probably within normal limits, but difficult to assess
 given AP portable technique and low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities at each
 medial lung base are probably due to atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear. There is no definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment suggesting mild basilar atelectasis with low lung volumes. 
 Endotracheal tube in suitable position.
