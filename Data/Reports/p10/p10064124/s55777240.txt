                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma during a motor vehicle collision.  Evaluate for traumatic
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed.  An
 overlying trauma board limits complete evaluation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is no displaced rib fracture appreciated.  A minimal dextroscoliosis of
 the thoracic spine is likely positional and unrelated to trauma.  There is no
 paraspinal hematoma appreciated.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
