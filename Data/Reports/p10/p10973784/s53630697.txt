                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with C. diff colitis, concern for UTI,
 worsening hypoxemia, question fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:54.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate-to-large left-sided pleural effusion and moderate right-sided pleural
 effusion with associated bibasilar airspace disease, most likely representing
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Overall, the effusions appear to have increased in size
 ___ ___.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There continues
 to be a hiatal hernia.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult
 to assess given differences in patient rotation and the presence of the
 effusions, but the heart appears to be stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.  There is a stable thoracolumbar curvature.
