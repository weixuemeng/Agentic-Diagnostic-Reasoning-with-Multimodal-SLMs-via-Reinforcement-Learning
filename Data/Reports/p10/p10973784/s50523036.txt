                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  A large retrocardiac opacity is again
 seen, consistent with a known large hiatal hernia containing segments of
 bowel.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is similar to prior.  There is
 bilateral lung base atelectasis and biapical scarring.  Heart borders are
 obscured but appear unchanged.  Calcified left hilar node and thoracic
 dextroscoliosis are stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bowel-containing hiatal hernia, similar to prior, with bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Superimposed retrocardiac consolidation can neither be excluded nor confirmed
 on this exam.
