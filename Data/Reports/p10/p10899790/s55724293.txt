                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung mass status post biopsy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Right basilar
 opacification is consistent with fluid and atelectasis.  There is again
 evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.
