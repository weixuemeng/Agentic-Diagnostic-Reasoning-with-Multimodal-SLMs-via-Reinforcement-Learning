 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, increasing oxygen requirement, rule out pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting multifocal
 pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly with evidence of mild fluid overload,
 slightly improved as compared to the previous examination.  Unchanged right
 sided and relatively extensive pleural effusion.
