                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The examination is limited
 secondary to patient's inability to cooperate.  The left costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.  There is near-complete opacification of the right
 lung base, likely a combination of new pleural effusion and consolidation. 
 Density in the retrocardiac region is less severe than the right.  There is
 increased central pulmonary vascular congestion as compared to prior.  The
 thoracic aorta appears tortuous.  Cardiac contours remain enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity, likely a combination of airspace disease
 (atelectasis or pneumonia) and effusion.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacities may reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis.
 3.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.
 4.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly
