                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with single lead terminating
 in the region of the right ventricle. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is re- demonstrated, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta again
 noted. The pulmonary vasculature remains mildly engorged, but appears chronic.
 Patchy opacity within the left lower lobe also appears long-standing,
 suggestive of atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. Lungs remain
 hyperinflated. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized with the
 right costophrenic angle excluded from the field of view on the frontal view.
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected. There are moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe could reflect an area of chronic
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly with mild chronic pulmonary vascular congestion.
