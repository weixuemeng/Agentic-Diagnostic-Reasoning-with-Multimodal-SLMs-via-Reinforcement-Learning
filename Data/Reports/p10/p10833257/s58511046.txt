                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam.  There has been an interval increase in the
 patchy opacification at the left base, which on the lateral view, localizes to
 the left lower lobe.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 The heart is moderately enlarged, and unchanged from prior exams.  A
 single-lead left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in the left lower lobe patchy opacification,
 which could be due to mild worsening chronic changes or a superimposed new
 infiltrate.
