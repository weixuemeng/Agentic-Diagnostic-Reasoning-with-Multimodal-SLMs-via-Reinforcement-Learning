                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia in a patient with a history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs aside
 from minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart size is stably minimally
 enlarged, and there is slight widening of the upper mediastinal silhouette
 suggestive of central venous engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild central venous engorgement suggestive of hypervolemia.
 2.  No evidence of decompensated congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
