                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypercarbic respiratory failure  // Eval ETT
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 2 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A new endotracheal tube ends at the right mainstem bronchus.  A nasogastric
 tube terminates off of the radiograph. The right lung is clear. Near complete
 opacification of the left lung represents a combination of atelectasis and a
 small amount of pleural fluid. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no free
 air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal
 borders is limited due to the partial left lung collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube ends at the right mainstem bronchus.  Retraction of
 the endotracheal tube is recommended.
 
 2. Near complete opacification of the left lung likely represent atelectasis
 and a small pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___ discussed with ___ at ___ ___, the time of
 discovery.
