                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged, but stable.  Re-demonstrated is fullness of the hila, with mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases, which are
 increased compared to the prior study, and may reflect areas of infection or
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There is no
 acute osseous finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
