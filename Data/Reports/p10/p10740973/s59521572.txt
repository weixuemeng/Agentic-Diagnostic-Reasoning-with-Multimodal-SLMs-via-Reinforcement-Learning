                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess feeding tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Feeding tube tip is in the stomach.  The tip has a loop at the fundus of the
 stomach.  Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right as before.  Right IJ
 catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Lower lobe opacity likely atelectasis is stable. 
 Sternal wires are aligned.
