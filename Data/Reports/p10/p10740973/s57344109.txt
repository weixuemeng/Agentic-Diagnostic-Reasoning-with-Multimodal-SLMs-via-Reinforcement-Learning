                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed and the Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back and replaced with
 a sheath in the IJ.  A chest tube remains in place, and there is no
 pneumothorax.  The opaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube straddles the
 esophagogastric junction.
 
 Apparent displacement of the mediastinum to the right most likely reflects
 obliquity of the patient.  Nevertheless, there could be some volume loss in
 the right lower lung contributing to this appearance.
