                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with unresponsive substance abuse ? seizure, s/p ETT at OSH,
 intubated sedated transfer.  Eval ? ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA head and neck from the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, but the heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 normal.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is difficult to identify, as it is
 superimposed on the enteric tube.  However, correlation with the CTA head and
 neck suggests that the tip is approximately 3.0 cm above the carina. 
 Bibasilar subtle opacities may reflect changes from aspiration.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm,
 curls in the stomach, and courses out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip approximately 3.0 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Subtle bibasilar opacities may reflect changes from aspiration.  Imaging
 followup to rule out worsening consolidation/aspiration is recommended.
