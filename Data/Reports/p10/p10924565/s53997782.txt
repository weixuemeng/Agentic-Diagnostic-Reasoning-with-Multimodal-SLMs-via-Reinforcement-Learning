                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of lung cancer presents with anemia,
 general weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 from the recent chest CT allowing for differences in technique.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Focal opacity within the left lower lobe
 partially reflects the known cavitary mass seen on the previous CT, with
 probable superimposed infection or atelectasis.  Additionally, multiple
 scattered pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not as well assessed on the
 current exam.  Trace left pleural effusion is present.  No right pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Innumerable sclerotic metastatic lesions
 are again seen within the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity within the left lower lobe likely reflects a combination of the
 patient's known cavitary mass as well as superimposed infection or
 atelectasis.  Trace left pleural effusion.  Known bilateral pulmonary nodules
 are better assessed on the prior CT.  Re- demonstration of diffuse sclerotic
 osseous metastases.
