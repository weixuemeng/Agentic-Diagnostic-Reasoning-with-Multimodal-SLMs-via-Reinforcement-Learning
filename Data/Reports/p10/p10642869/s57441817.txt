                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral upright chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, wheezing, and productive cough when
 running x ___ year, history of prostate ca  // r/o mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a well-circumscribed, circular, 6.3 cm calcified mass present in the
 left upper quadrant. This may represent a calcified splenic lesion/cyst,
 versus a large pancreatic pseudocyst, and less likely a calcified splenic
 artery aneurysm.  The location of the lesion makes this less likely a
 pancreatic pseudocyst.  Correlation with an abdominal ultrasound is
 recommended if this is not a previously known finding.
 
 The mediastinal structures are within normal limits. There is no cardiomegaly.
 The hila are unremarkable. The lung fields are clear without evidence of focal
 consolidation. There are no pneumothoraces or effusions apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Circular calcified left upper quadrant abdominal lesion with differential
 including calcified splenic cyst, versus less likely a large pancreatic
 pseudocyst or calcified splenic artery aneurysm. Recommend correlation with
 abdominal ultrasound.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were reported to the radiology critical
 findings dashboard on ___ at 13:52.
