                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  As
 seen on the prior chest CT there is a mass at the left lung apex suggesting
 primary malignancy.  Upper mediastinal contours are also prominent, although
 unchanged since the chest CT, reflecting prominent mediastinal fat but also
 lymphadenopathy worrisome for metastatic disease.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities suggest minor atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis. 
 Findings similar to a recent prior CT with regard to findings suggesting
 primary pulmonary malignancy and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
