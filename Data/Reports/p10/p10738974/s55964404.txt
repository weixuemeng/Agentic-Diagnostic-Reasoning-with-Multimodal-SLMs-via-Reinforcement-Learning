                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tibial plateau  fracture// pre-op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures likely is due to low
 lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
