                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with dyspnea and decreased pulmonary function
 tests, with evidence of fluid overload on recent chest radiographs in ___.
 The patient is on amiodarone.  Could drug toxicity have caused hemoptysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___, the heart size has returned to normal, bilateral pleural
 effusions have resolved and what was probably right upper lobe pneumonia and
 left lower lobe atelectasis have both substantially cleared.  There is some
 residual atelectasis at one of the lung bases, best appreciated on the lateral
 view and there is a small region of atelectasis in the lingula obscuring a
 portion of the cardiac apex, but there are no findings to suggest active
 pneumonia or cardiac decompensation.
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting. 
 Configuration of the diaphragm indicates severe hyperinflation attributable to
 COPD.
 
 There are no findings to suggest amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.
