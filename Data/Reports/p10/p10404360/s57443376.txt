 FINDINGS:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased compared to prior.  There is
 improved aeration of bilateral lung bases with interval resolution of right
 lower lung consolidation; minimal bibasilar atelectasis persists.  However,
 right upper lobe consolidation persists. No pneumothorax is seen.  There is
 moderate to severe cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal clips
 are noted.  Sternal wires appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved aeration at the right lung base but persistent right upper lobe
 consolidation.
