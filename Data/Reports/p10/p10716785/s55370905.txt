                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Right PICC tip terminates in the
 superior aspect of the SVC.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Linear opacity in left mid lung field likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but
 this is improved compared to the prior study.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are punctate radiopaque densities
 projecting over the right lung base, which are unchanged from the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with improved mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the left mid lung field.
