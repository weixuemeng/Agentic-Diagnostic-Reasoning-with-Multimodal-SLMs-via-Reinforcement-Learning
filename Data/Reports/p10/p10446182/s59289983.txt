                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AIDS, currently hypothermic, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS.  This is a redictation of a report dictated earlier in the day. 
 
 
 Rotated positioning.  A right subclavian central line is present, tip over
 distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely unchanged, allowing for
 differences in positioning.  The aorta is unfolded and possibly mildly
 ectatic.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and small
 posterior bilateral effusions.  Again seen are faint opacities at both bases,
 unchanged, ? atelectasis.  No ___ consolidation is identified.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions.  No definite consolidation.
