                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, dyspnea, ___ edema  // presence of
 infiltrate, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Airspace opacity is seen overlying the right upper lung. There is also
 prominence of the hila and perihilar vessels bilaterally suggesting some
 pulmonary edema. There are low lung volumes. There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace pleural effusion.  Relatively
 linear opacity projecting over the lateral left mid to lower lung, is
 nonspecific.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is
 mild to moderately enlarged. The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lung airspace opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.
 Recommend followup to resolution. Prominence of the hila and perihilar vessels
 suggests some pulmonary edema. Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
