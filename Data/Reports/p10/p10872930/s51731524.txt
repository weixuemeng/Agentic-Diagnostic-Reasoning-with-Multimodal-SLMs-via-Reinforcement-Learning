                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diffuse pain and fever to 102.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Prominence and slight indistinctness of the hila likely
 relates to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is mild interstitial edema. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  Left base retrocardiac opacity most likely
 relates to overlapping vessels and possible atelectasis, although on
 developing consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement and interstitial edema.  Patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to vascular structures and possible
 atelectasis however, developing consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
