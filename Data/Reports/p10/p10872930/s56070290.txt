                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  A mild interstitial abnormality appears similar to
 the prior examination and suggests slight background congestion, but otherwise
 the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Severe degenerative changes again involve the left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild similar background interstitial abnormality suggesting
 pulmonary congestion, but similar to before.
