 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever and elevated white count. 
 Assess for signs of infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There is again seen cardiomegaly, which is stable.  Median sternotomy wires
 and numerous surgical clips are seen.  Calcifications of the thoracic aorta
 are present.  There is again seen some increased density in the left
 retrocardiac area, which may be due to combination of scarring, atelectasis
 and pleural fluid.  Atelectasis at the right base is more prominent than on
 the prior study.  There are no pneumothoraces.  Degenerative changes of both
 shoulders and rotator cuff ruptures are seen bilaterally.
