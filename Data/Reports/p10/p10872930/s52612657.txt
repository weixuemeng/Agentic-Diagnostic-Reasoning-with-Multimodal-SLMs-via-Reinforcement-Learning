 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and productive cough for 1 week.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are mild interstitial opacities
 suggestive of interstitial edema.  On the lateral view, there is increased
 opacity projecting over the lower lobes not definitively identified on the
 frontal noting that the left lung base is not well evaluated due to overlying
 soft tissues.  Superiorly the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is stable with multiple clips and median sternotomy wires. 
 Surgical clips also seen in the neck on the right.  Trachea is deviated to the
 right at the thoracic inlet similar to prior.  Degenerative changes seen at
 the left shoulder.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Possible lower lobe opacity, potentially on the left.  This
 could represent infection in the proper clinical setting.
