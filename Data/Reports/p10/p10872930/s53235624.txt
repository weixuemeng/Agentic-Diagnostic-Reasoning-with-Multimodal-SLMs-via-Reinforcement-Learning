                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypertension.  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonia,
 fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  .
 
 REPORT:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Extensive bypass clips are
 also noted.  Clips are noted over the right side of the neck, possibly
 reflecting thyroid surgery.  There has been a poor inspiratory effort with low
 lung volumes.  There is some patchy changes at the left base, not
 significantly changed from before.  There is probably very minimal congestive
 change with some cephalizationparticularly in the left upper lung zone.  The
 appearances are not as on the prior study.  There is no additional acute
 cardiopulmonary finding.  There is significant pathology in the left shoulder
 where pseudoarthrosis is suggested.
 
 There is likely an old fracture at the thoracolumbar junction.  CT from
 ___ suggested this, although the appearances may have progressed
 since then and dedicated imaging might be useful of the lumbar spine depending
 on clinical symptoms.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Minimal congestive changes.  No additional acute finding.
