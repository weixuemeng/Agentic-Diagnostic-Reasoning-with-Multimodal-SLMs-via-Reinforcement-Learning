                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___/F s/p right TKA with Oxygen requirement, increasing WBC, and
 elevated temp.  Evaluate for pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower, particularly in the
 right lower lobe.  A new right lower lobe opacity on both views is at least
 atelectasis.  Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.  A small right effusion
 is new.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe opacity is at minimum atelectasis.  However given the
 clinical history, superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
