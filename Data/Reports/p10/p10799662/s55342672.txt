                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___ WITH COMPARISON STUDY OF ONE DAY EARLIER
 
 FINDINGS:  Small right apical pneumothorax is minimally decreased compared to
 the prior radiograph, and dependent right pleural effusion also appears
 slightly decreased.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or consolidation
 appears similar, but adjacent small left pleural effusion has apparently
 resolved.
