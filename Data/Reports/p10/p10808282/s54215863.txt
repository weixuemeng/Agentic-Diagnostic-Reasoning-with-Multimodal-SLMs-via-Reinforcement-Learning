                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with end-stage renal disease, missed two
 dialysis sessions, now with crackles right greater than left.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral pleural effusions persist and are likely increased
 slightly.  Heart size is again noted to be enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular
 engorgement persists and is similar.  Lung volumes are low.  Linear opacities
 at the right base appear similar compared to prior and likely represent
 atelectasis or scarring.  Lumbar spine hardware is incompletely imaged. 
 Right-sided dialysis catheter is poorly evaluated on this study, but likely
 terminates in the low right atrium.  Right subclavian stent is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular prominence, and bilateral
 pleural effusions, probably increased somewhat.
