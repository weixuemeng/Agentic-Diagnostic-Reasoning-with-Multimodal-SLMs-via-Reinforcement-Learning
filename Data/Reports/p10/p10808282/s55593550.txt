                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Obtunded.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  As before,
 there is a right tunneled internal jugular dialysis catheter, ending in the
 low right atrium.  A right vascular stent projects over the right
 scapula/clavicle, not significantly changed.  A small left pleural effusion
 may be slightly increased.  A small right pleural effusion is not
 significantly changed.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Opacification at the right lung base is
 similar in appearance to prior radiographs and could be atelectasis and/or
 scarring.  No focal consolidations are noted.  There is fullness of the
 pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged opacification of the right lung base is likely combination of
 atelectasis and scarring and effusion.
 
 2.  Slightly increased left and unchanged right small pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 4.  Fullness of the pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema
