                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral pleural catheters remain in place as well as a right
 PICC.  Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been dramatic increase in
 extent of opacification of the left hemithorax, which is nearly completely
 opacified with the exception of portions of the left upper lobe.  This is
 likely due primarly to an enlarging left pleural effusion in the setting of
 recent clamping of pleural tube by history; near complete collapse of the left
 lung is likely secondary to the effusion with or without a component of
 bronchial obstruction from mucous plugging.  This finding has been
 communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 1:00 p.m. on ___ at
 the time of discovery.  On the right, a small pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis are not appreciably changed.
