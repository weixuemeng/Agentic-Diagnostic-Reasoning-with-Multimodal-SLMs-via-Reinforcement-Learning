                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Free air and blood in the abdomen.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Severe rotary dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is demonstrated.  Large left and moderate-to-large right
 pleural effusions appear slightly increased in size compared to the prior
 study.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is limited due to the
 presence of the bilateral pleural effusions.  There is marked calcification of
 the thoracic aorta.  Hazy perihilar opacities with engorgement of the
 pulmonary vascularity suggests mild pulmonary edema.  There is bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflective compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  Known free air within the abdomen seen on the recent CT at 15:41
 performed the same day is not clearly noted on the current exam.  Excreted
 contrast material is noted within the left collecting system.  Evaluation for
 rib fractures is limited, though no markedly displaced rib fractures are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left and moderate-to-large right, bilateral pleural effusions with
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Known free air within the abdomen is not clearly visualized on the current
 study.
 
 4.  No displaced rib fractures are noted.  The study, however, is limited for
 the detection of rib fractures, though no acute rib fractures in the lower
 thorax were demonstrated on the recent CT of the abdomen.
