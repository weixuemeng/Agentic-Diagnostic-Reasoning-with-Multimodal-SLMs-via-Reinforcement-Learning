                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right pleural effusion status post PleurX
 catheter placement.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a pleural pigtail catheter at
 the right costophrenic angle with improvement in the previously described
 right-sided pleural effusion.  The right lung is well aerated.  There is
 complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflecting components of
 left lung collapse and pleural fluid.  This hemithoracic opacification
 obscures the heart and mediastinal contours.  Again, there is marked
 dextroscoliosis of thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right pleural pigtail catheter placement without evidence of pneumothorax
 and improvement in right pleural effusion.
 2.  Left hemithoracic opacification reflecting components of pleural effusion
 and left lung collapse.
