                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pleural effusion following placement of left-sided
 Pleurx catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In addition to chronic dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine, the
 patient is markedly leftwardly rotated and in a reverse lordotic
 configuration, making assessment difficult.  There has been marked reduction
 in size of the left-sided pleural effusion since placement of the catheter;
 however, there is a new right-sided moderate pleural effusion.  A horizontal
 line underlying the left main stem bronchus is likely the diaphragmatic
 contour, although the presence of an air-fluid level cannot be excluded on
 these limited views.  There is no pneumothorax, and the visualized lung fields
 are clear.  Cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval reduction in size of left-sided pleural effusion with possible
 new moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
 2.  Given the limitations of this current study, a repeat chest radiograph
 with more careful positioning to avoid rotation should be considered.
