                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:39 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  New intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2:39 a.m.:
 
 ET tube is at the level of the sternal notch, no less than 4 cm from the
 carina, but the tip abuts the left wall of the trachea due to severe
 scoliosis.  Lower lobe atelectasis, small-to-moderate left and
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion are unchanged.  I do not think there
 is no pneumothorax but skin folds and anatomic distortion make that
 determination difficult.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Nasogastric tube
 ends in the stomach.
