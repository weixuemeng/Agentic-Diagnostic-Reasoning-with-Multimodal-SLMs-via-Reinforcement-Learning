                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent respiratory failure, effusions, now with right Pleurx in
 place, whiteout of the left lung likely from mucous plugging.  Please evaluate
 left lung atelectasis/mucous plugging and right lung effusion with Pleurx in
 place.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemithorax persists without appreciable
 change.  The moderate right pleural effusion is slightly larger since
 yesterday despite reported good drainage from the Pleurx catheter.  Of note,
 the intrathoracic component of the catheter appears to be sharply kinked.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is nearly completely obscured by the bilateral
 opacities.  There is no evidence of apical pneumothorax.  A right PICC line
 terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax is unchanged and while there
 may be a component of pleural effusion, lung collapse is highly suspected,
 perhaps secondary to mucous plugging as suggested.  
 
 2. The moderate right pleural effusion is slightly larger and the
 intrathoracic portion of the Pleurx catheter appears kinked. 
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at
