                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lymphoma and shortness of breath.  Decreased
 left breath sounds.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  When compared to prior, there is interval improvement in
 the appearance of the left hemithorax now with aerated left upper lobe.  There
 is, however, a large left-sided pleural effusion.  There is also no
 significant aeration of the left lower lobe suggesting underlying atelectasis,
 possible consolidation.  The right-sided pleural effusion has also likely
 decreased in size since prior.  Right basilar infection is not excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given dense opacity in the
 left lung.  Left subclavian line and NG tubes are no longer seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left-sided pleural effusion with increased aeration of the
 left upper lobe when compared to prior.  Decrease in size of right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Presumed left lower lobe and right base atelectasis with
 infection not excluded.
