                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDCATION:  Chylous pleural effusion with left-sided pigtail pleural catheter
 actively draining.  The patient has a history of AML and bladder cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and series of older
 studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest depict the left-sided
 pigtail pleural drainage catheter in unchanged position.  There is a
 persistent small left-sided pleural effusion which appears to be loculated
 into two components, anteriorly and posteriorly.  The drainage catheter is
 within the anterior component.  The size of the effusion on the left has
 decreased from the prior study and the right-sided effusion has almost
 completely resolved.  There is no pneumothorax and the lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Severe cardiomegaly and scoliosis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Loculated small left pleural effusion has decreased in size, and a
 drainage catheter is within the anterior component of the effusion.
 2.  Right-sided effusion has decreased considerably in size.
 3.  Pneumothorax is no longer apparent.
