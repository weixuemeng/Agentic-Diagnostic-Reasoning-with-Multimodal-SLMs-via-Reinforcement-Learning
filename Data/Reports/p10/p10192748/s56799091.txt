 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 16:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lymphoma and recurrent pleural effusion
 status post pigtail placement thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 16:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a left pigtail catheter with decrease in size of a
 left pleural effusion.  There continues to be a right pleural effusion.  There
 is a loculated medial left apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar patchy opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  There is also suggestion of a hiatal
 hernia.  There is a marked thoracolumbar curvature with diffuse osteopenia and
 degenerative changes.  Calcifications of the aortic knob. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
