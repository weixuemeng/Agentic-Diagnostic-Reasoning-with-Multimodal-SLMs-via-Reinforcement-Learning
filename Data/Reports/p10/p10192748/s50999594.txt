                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with PICC line.  To assess position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The tip of the right-sided PICC line has been retracted and probably
 lies at the brachiocephalic/caval junction.
 
 There is an unchanged background change within the left hemithorax.  In the
 right lung, the chest tube remains unchanged, and probably slightly kinked
 shortly after entry through the chest wall.  No right-sided pneumothorax
 though fluid persists in the right base.  Profound scoliosis.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Slight retraction of PICC line.  Unchanged chronic changes.
