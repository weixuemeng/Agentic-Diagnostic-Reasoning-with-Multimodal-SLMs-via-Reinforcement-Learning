                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of lymphoma with prior
 pleural effusion, now with increased shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Significant cardiac enlargement appears to
 be present; however, difficult to identify radiographically as bilateral
 pleural effusions obscure diaphragms and cardiac contours.  The lateral view
 discloses bilateral pleural effusions extending into the posterior pleural
 sinuses.  As before, the patient has marked S-shaped scoliosis and accentuated
 kyphosis in the thoracic spine.  There is evidence of aortic wall
 calcifications both in the arch as well as in the entire descending and
 abdominal aorta.  In comparison with the next preceding similar study of
 ___, the findings are grossly identical although some possible further
 increase of pleural effusion is suggested.  No evidence of new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, although the bases remain obscured by the bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
