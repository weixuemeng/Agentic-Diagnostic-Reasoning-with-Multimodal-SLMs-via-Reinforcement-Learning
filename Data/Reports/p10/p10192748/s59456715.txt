                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hyponatremia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a similar large left-sided pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis involving the left lower lobe and probably the lingula.
 The pleural effusion is similar in size, but there may be increased patchy
 opacity, probably atelectasis, associated with the lingula projecting over the
 left mid lung.  In the right lower lung, a pleural effusion also persists,
 although smaller than the one seen on the left, although likely at least
 moderate in size.  Although lung volumes are lower on this study, increased
 right lower lobe opacification, probably in the left lower lobe, appears new
 or increased.  Otherwise, there has been no significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right lower lung opacity which may reflect an increase
 in atelectasis.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia is also a
 consideration in the appropriate setting, however.
