                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer and CLL presents
 with pleural chest pain.  Outside hospital imaging indicated possible pleural
 effusion.  Study is to evaluate patient for possible thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is a mild left-sided posterior sulcus opacity which might
 represent a small pleural effusion.  Pleural effusion can be confirmed with a
 left down decubitus study.  If diagnostic sample of the fluid is desired,
 thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance would be recommended.  The heart is
 within normal limits for size.  The aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified. 
 There is severe thoracic dextroscoliosis which distorts the lung bases. The
 diaphragm is seen in the higher position relative to previous studies.  No
 acute infiltrates are identified.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left posterior basal opacity might represent small pleural
 effusion.  Thoracentesis, if warranted, should be performed under ultrasound
 guidance.
