 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, low saturation, questionable
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:52 p.m.

 effusion, there is a zone of increased parenchymal density in the lateral
 aspects of the left hemithorax, suggesting the presence of coexisting
 atelectasis.  However, a more acute event such as parenchymal bleeding should
 not be excluded.  Close monitoring is strongly suggested.
 
 There is no evidence of left pneumothorax.  The right lung appears unchanged.
