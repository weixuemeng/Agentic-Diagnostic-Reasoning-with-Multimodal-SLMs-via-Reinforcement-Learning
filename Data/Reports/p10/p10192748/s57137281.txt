                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been little interval change compared to the prior exam.  Marked
 rotary scoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right are similar when
 compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Pleural-based opacity within the left lateral hemithorax likely
 reflects fluid within the fissure.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess
 given the presence of the pleural effusions and scoliosis. Marked aortic knob
 calcifications are present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from the prior exam.  Persistent bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, with bibasilar atelectasis and
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Pleural based opacity in the left lateral
 hemithorax likely reflects fluid within the fissure.
