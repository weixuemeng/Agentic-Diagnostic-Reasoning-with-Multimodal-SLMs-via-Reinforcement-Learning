                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with respiratory failure, left lung collapse and
 followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There has been only minimally improvement of a small area of aerated lung in
 the mid left hemithorax , ther rest of thr hemithorax is opacified, a
 combination of large areas of atelectasis and unknown amount of effusion. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 obscured by the left lung opacities.  Right PICC tip is at the confluence of
 the brachiocephalic vein as before.  Right lower lobe opacity is a combination
 of small effusion and adjacent atelectasis, unchanged from prior.  There is a
 PleurX catheter in the right base, unchanged. Severe scoliosis is again noted.
