                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever status post chemotherapy.  Evaluate
 for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  In the interim since ___ the
 distribution of a moderate left pleural effusion has changed in distribution
 but not appreciably in volume. Small right pleural effusion is smaller.  Left
 lower lobe is probably collapsed, as before. Aside from chronic, mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, lungs are otherwise clear.  Severe rotatory
 scoliosis of thoracic spine is longstanding.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult
 to assess given the left pleural abnormality and scoliosis, but neither
 grossly enlarged nor changed.  Marked aortic knob calcification is a normal
 change of aging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate left unchanged, small right
 slightly improved.  Probable left lower lobe collapse, persistent.  Mild,
 chronic pulmonary vascular congestion, but no edema.
