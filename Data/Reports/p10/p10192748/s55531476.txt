 large areas of atelectasis and unknown amount of pleural effusion.  Right PICC
 tip is in the low SVC.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  Cardiomediastinum
 is obscured by the left lung opacities, is deviated towards the left.  Large
 right effusion is unchanged.  Severe right scoliosis is again noted.  Right
