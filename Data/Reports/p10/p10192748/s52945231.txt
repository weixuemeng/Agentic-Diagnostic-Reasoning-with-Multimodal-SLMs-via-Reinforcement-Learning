                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bladder cancer and confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___ and ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since ___, the left pigtail catheter has been removed.
 Aeration of the left lobe has decreased with volume loss and increased left
 pleural effusion.  An opacity at the left pleura is probably fluid in the
 fissure, less likely a mass or infection. A right pleural effusion is
 unchanged. No pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate given
 the effusions.  Aortic knob calcifications are again seen.  There is marked
 scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Interval increase in left pleural effusion with left lower lobe volume
 loss. Supervening infection cannot be excluded.  
 2. Left pleural opacity is likely fluid in the fissure, less likely mass or
 infection. Follow up radiograph is recommended.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 12:07pm ___.
