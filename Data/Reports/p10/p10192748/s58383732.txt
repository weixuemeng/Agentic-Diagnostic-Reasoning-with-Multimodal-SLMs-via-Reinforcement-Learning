                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  This is an ___-year-old woman with lymphoma and bilateral pleural
 effusions after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small left pleural effusion has decreased substantially and there is no
 pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe still remains largely atelectatic. 
 Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion may have increased.  The heart size
 is indeterminate obscured by adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. 
 Upper lobe vasculature is engorged, but I cannot assess whether mild edema is
 present.
