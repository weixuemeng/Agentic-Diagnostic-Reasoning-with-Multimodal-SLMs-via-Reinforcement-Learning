                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is in unchanged position, approximately 6 cm above the carina.
 NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip being at least in the
 stomach.  Surgical drain is projecting next to the NG tube.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, bibasal atelectasis are unchanged as well as the position of the
 left subclavian line.  Assessment of the mediastinum is difficult due to
 severe dextroscoliosis.
