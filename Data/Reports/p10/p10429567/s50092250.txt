                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob  // r/o worsening CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A severe dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracic spine is again seen.  There is a stable appearance of blunting at the
 left costophrenic angle which could represent a pleural effusion versus
 pleural thickening.  The lungs appear otherwise clear though hyperinflated. 
 Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings.  Stable blunting of the left CP angle on the frontal
 projection which given chronicity of this finding is more compatible with
 pleural thickening/ scarring at this site.  Consider CT to further assess.
