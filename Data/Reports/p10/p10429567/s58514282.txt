                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with wheezing, SOB, weight gain  // ? CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 All there is a diffuse reticular pattern evident within the right lung in the
 mid lower portions within appearance on the lateral film that suggests a
 chronic interstitial abnormality. While the fissures are thickened, there is
 not other definite evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is small left pleural
 effusion and left basilar consolidation that could represent atelectasis,
 though pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is marked cardiomegaly.  Aortic
 arch calcifications indicate atherosclerosis. Bones appear osteopenic but
 there are no definite concerning bone findings though the spine is not well
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly but no definite acute pulmonary edema.  Left pleural effusion and
 likely left basilar atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be completely
 excluded. Suggestion of chronic interstitial disease.
