                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lymphoma, presents with STEMI and pulmonary
 hypertension on echo.  Please evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There appears to be mild interval increase in the diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  There appears to be slight
 interval increase in consolidation overlying the right lower lung.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in the bilateral mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Slight interval increase in focal consolidation overlying the right lower
 lung.  This could be secondary to atelectasis; however, supervening infectious
 process cannot be excluded on this study.
