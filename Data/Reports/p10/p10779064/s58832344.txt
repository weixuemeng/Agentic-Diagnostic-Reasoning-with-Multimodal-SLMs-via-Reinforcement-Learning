                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post mitral valve and tricuspid valve replacement and
 CABG.  Chest tubes removed.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the right internal jugular
 catheter in unchanged position ending in the mid SVC.  There is stable
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are likely unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  Mild pulmonary
 edema persists.  The small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
