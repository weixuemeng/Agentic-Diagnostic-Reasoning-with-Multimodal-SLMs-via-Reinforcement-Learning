                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve and
 tricuspid valve repair and CABG with rising white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
 No definitive pneumothorax is noted on the current study.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasal consolidations are noted.  Overall, no definitive focal
 consolidation which could be new and explain the patient's symptoms is
 demonstrated but bibasal or unibasal pneumonia is a possibility.
