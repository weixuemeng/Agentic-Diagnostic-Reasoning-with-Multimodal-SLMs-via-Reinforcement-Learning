                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, elevated white blood cell count, and
 increased respiratory rate and absent breath sounds at the right lung base. 
 Evaluate for interval change, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right lower lobe opacification is again seen but is improving
 compared to previous chest radiograph.  Continued bibasilar small pleural
 effusions are seen with associated atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette and
 the mediastinal contours are normal.  Mild pulmonary edema continues to be
 seen.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Right lower lobe opacity may be associated with atelectasis, but supervening
 infectious process cannot be ruled out.
