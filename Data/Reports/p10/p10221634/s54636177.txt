 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, no definite
 cardiomediastinal enlargement.  There are patchy opacities at both lung bases.
 No CHF or gross effusion.  
 
 An unusual curvilinear density overlies the left scapular neck, not fully
 characterized, but nonaggressive in appearance.The lower portion of a cervical
 neck fusion plate is noted, not fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:   
 1) ET tube at the level of the lower medial clavicles, slightly high. 
 Clinical correlation requested.
 
 2) Bibasilar opacities. 
 
 3) Unusual opacity overlying left medial scapula, possibly artifact versus
 nonaggressive lucent lesion.  Consider further evaluation with dedicated
 shoulder radiographs.
