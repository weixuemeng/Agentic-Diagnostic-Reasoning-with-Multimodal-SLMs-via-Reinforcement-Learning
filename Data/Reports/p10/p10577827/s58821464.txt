                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pill aspiration  // r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiographs ___, outside CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is slightly increased prominence of the hila compared to prior, as well
 as moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  There
 is mild to moderate right basilar airspace opacity and a trace right effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is moderate, worse compared to prior.
 Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Findings suggesting heart failure.
 3. Right basilar opacities likely represents a combination of atelectasis,
 edema, effusion, and aspiration.
 4. Ground-glass opacity in the inferior right upper lobe is similar to prior
 CT and could be due to aspiration or infection.
