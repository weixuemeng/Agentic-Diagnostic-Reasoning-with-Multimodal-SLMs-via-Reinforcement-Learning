                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with previous history of
 pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism and currently one day of left-sided chest
 pain, was found to have pulmonary embolism and currently has a low-grade
 fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. 
 
 Currently lung volumes are low with bibasal opacities present, left more than
 right, potentially reflecting progression of already demonstrated basal
 opacities that on the left can potentially reflect pulmonary infarct due to
 pulmonary embolism demonstrated on prior CT.  No new consolidation to suggest
 interval progression of pneumonia demonstrated, although it cannot be entirely
 excluded.
