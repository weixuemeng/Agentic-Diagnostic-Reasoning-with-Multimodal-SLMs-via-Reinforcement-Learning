                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, concern for pneumonia, eight days after
 tracheobronchoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved and right lower lobe opacification
 nearly cleared, probably due to deposition of edema in a region of
 atelectasis.  Left lower lobe, however, remains effectively collapsed.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Mild cardiac enlargement is chronic. 
 No pneumothorax.  No change in mediastinal contours.  This study is not
 adequate for assessment of the trachea, much less the post-operative trachea.
