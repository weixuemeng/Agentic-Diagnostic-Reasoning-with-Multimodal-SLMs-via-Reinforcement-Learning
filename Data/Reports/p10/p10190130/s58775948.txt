                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:18 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Postoperative day 7 after tracheoplasty, following bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous left upper lobe collapse has resolved.  Moderate cardiomegaly has
 increased, as has the caliber of pulmonary and hilar vasculature.  New
 opacification in the right lower lung is probably atelectasis, but should be
 followed radiographically.  Pleural thickening surrounds multiple healed
 fractures in the lateral right hemithorax.  No pneumothorax.
