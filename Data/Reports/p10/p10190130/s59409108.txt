                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 05:59.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 15 11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left chest tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  There is improving aeration in the left hemithorax.  However, there
 continues to be partial left upper lobe collapse as well as more patchy areas
 of opacity in the left mid and lower lung, which also could represent residual
 atelectasis.  Overall, when compared to studies dating from ___, the
 previously seen pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is subcutaneous emphysema
 within the neck soft tissues.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures with
 associated pleural thickening and patchy opacity at the right base is stable. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the
 left hemithorax airspace process.  No pneumothorax.
