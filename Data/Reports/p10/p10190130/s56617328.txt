                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheoplasty with continued effusion and edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the series of examinations dating back to ___,
 the opacification in the left hemithorax has somewhat decreased, consistent
 with some improvement in the degree of left upper lobe collapse.  Again,
 lateral view would be most helpful to better evaluate this region.  
 
 There is increasing opacification along the right lateral chest wall.  This
 could be related to the multiple rib fractures and be accentuated by some
 obliquity of the patient.  No evidence of appreciable pneumothorax. 
 Subcutaneous gas persists on the right, especially in the supraclavicular
 region.
