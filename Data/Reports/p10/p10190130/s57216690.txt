                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheobronchoplasty, here to evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. 
 There is deviation of the trachea to the left towards the aortic knob, which
 suggests left upper lobe volume loss.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 greater on the right than the left, as before.  Prominent irregular
 opacification along the right lateral chest wall demonstrates multiple healed
 rib fractures.  The opacification pattern in the left hemithorax is relatively
 stable on the frontal view and thought to represent persistent left upper lobe
 collapse.  Increased lower lobe opacification on the lateral view from ___
 is of uncertain etiology.  No definite pneumothorax is detected.  No loculated
 mediastinal air is seen on the lateral view.  The cardiac silhouette is
 indistinct but likely within normal limits.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 or pulmonary edema is present.  Exaggerated thoracic kyphosis is noted with
 generalized loss of height of multiple vertebral bodies and mild degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent suspected left upper lobe collapse.  If there is clinical
 doubt, CT scanning is recommended for clarification.
 2.  Increased lower lobe opacification on the lateral view from ___ with
 unchanged frontal view of uncertain etiology.  
 3.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
