                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis  // R/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:
 Outside chest radiograph ___ and outside CT torso ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and resulting in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor,
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Bibasilar atelectasis has worsened
 since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier and is accompanied by increasing
 small to moderate left pleural effusion and persistent small right pleural
 effusion.
