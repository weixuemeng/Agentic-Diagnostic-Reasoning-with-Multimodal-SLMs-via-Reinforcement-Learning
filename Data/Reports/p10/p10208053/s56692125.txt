                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post dual-chamber pacemaker.  Evaluate
 lead position and rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:54 p.m. and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views were obtained.  Low lung volumes result
 in bronchovascular crowding.  The pacemaker leads end in the expected
 locations of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right basilar atelectasis. 
 Heart is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal allowing for lung volumes with prosthetic valve and intact median
 sternotomy wires. Multiple wedge compression deformities in the mid thoracic
 spine are seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax. Pacemaker leads in satisfactory position.
