                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachycardia  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are remarkable. 
 Slight prominence of the hila may be due to central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild biapical pleural
 thickening.  Subtle chronic appearing deformity of the posterior right seventh
 and eighth ribs may be sequela of prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary
 edema.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
