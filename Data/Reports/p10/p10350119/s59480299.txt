 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:25 PM
  
  
  Compared with ___
  Bilateral opacities, slightly improved since the prior examination with small
  left-sided pleural effusion, consistent with probable edema, though underlying
  consolidation is not excluded.  Overall similar to most recent comparison.
  
  No definite pneumothorax is identified, though evaluation is somewhat limited
  given semi-upright nature of the examination.
  
  Since the prior examination, the patient has been intubated, with the tip
  terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A right-sided internal
  jugular line terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  A transesophageal tube
  is not entirely visualized.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress  // Assess for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, the patient has been disease with endotracheal tube tip
 terminating approximately 4 cm above the level the carina.  Right-sided
 internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of
 the field of view.  Since the prior study, bilateral opacities have
 significantly improved, with residual opacity seen in the right mid to lower
 lung and slightly at the left lung base.  Obscuration left hemidiaphragm is
 within due to a small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval improvement in previously seen bilateral pulmonary
 opacities with right greater than left bilateral lower lung pulmonary
 opacities remaining.
 
 Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be due to atelectasis with a small
 pleural effusion.
