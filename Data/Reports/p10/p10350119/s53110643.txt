                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Thank you
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with flu and respiratory distress  // Assess
 for progression of lung opacities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral areas of
 consolidation predominantly in the mid and lower lung progressed, particularly
 in the left perihilar region.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are
 difficult to compare to the prior study due to positional differences bladder
 likely unchanged accounting for this factor.
