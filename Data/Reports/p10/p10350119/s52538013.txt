 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with clogged Dobhoff  // Evaluate any interval
 change in Dobhoff position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with the prior radiograph, the dobhoff tube is now malpositioned
 with the tip in the esophagus, and should be advanced.  There is a right
 subclavian catheter, which is unchanged in positioning, terminating in the low
 SVC.
 
 There are bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated compressive
 atelectasis, which are stable in size compared to prior.  The previously
 visualized pulmonary edema has resolved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Malpositioned dobhoff tube with the tip in the esophagus.
 2. Unchanged positioning of right subclavian catheter.
 3. Improved pulmonary edema.
 4. Stable bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
