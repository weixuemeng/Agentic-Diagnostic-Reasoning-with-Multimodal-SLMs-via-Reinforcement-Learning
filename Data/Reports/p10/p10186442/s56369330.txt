                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 Dobbhoff tube with the tip in the mid to lower body of the stomach.  As on the
 previous study, there is increased opacification at the bases, consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobes and layering pleural effusions.  Enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette and evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion persist.
