                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is opacification along the base of
 each hemithorax suggesting moderate-sized pleural effusions with parenchymal
 opacities, most commonly due to atelectasis.  The cardiac contours are partly
 obscured, but the heart is probably at least mildly enlarged.  There is no
 evidence for parenchymal edema.  Mild degenerative changes affect lower
 thoracic levels.  The thoracic spine curves to the left side to a
 mild-to-moderate degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with opacities that can probably be
 attributed to atelectasis, although not entirely specific, as well as
 suspected mild cardiomegaly; however, no parenchymal edema identified.
