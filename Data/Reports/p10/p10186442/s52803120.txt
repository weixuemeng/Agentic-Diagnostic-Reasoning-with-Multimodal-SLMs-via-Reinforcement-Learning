  Since the prior study taken earlier today, there is a new left chest tube
  located in the left lower pleural space, with significant reduction in size of
  the left pleural effusion and reinflation of the atelectatic left lower lobe.
  Right pleural effusion persists. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. ETT and
  OGT are unchanged.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // chest tube patient
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 06:10.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___:10 following insertion of a pigtail pleural drainage catheter at the
 base of the left chest chest, the previous moderate to large left pleural
 effusion has been substantially drained and there is no pneumothorax. Moderate
 right pleural effusion persists.  Pulmonary vasculature is congested, but I
 doubt that pulmonary edema is present. Mild cardiomegaly is improved.  ET tube
 is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the duodenum and out of
 view.
