                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the most important change
 is a newly appeared small lateral right pleural effusion.  This effusion can
 be noncharacteristic, but can also be an indicator for either lung diseases
 invisible on the chest film or right upper quadrant diseases.  For example,
 unilateral small pleural effusions can be indicative for pulmonary embolism. 
 According to the clinical situation of the patient, further evaluation by CT
 should be strongly considered.
 
 Right Port-A-Cath.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
