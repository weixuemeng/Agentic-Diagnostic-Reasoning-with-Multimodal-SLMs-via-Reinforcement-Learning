                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/worsening hip plain s/p right bipolar hemiarthroplasty in
 ___, then car accident in ___ with dashboard injury to right knee. 
 Admitted for right total hip revision.  // productive cough with mild
 leukocytosis
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are flattened diaphragms suggestive of probable background COPD. 
 However, on the frontal view, inspiratory volumes are relatively low.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis.  No air bronchograms or confluent opacity to suggest
 focal consolidation.  No CHF.  Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle. 
 No gross effusion.  Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis, new compared with ___.  An early
 pneumonic infiltrate is considered much less likely.  Suspect background COPD.
