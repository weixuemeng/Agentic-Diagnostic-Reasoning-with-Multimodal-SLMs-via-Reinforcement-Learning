                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath again terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Its
 looped course appears unchanged.  Allowing for decreased lung volumes, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged.  There is a
 persistent small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion, probably largely
 subpulmonic.  It appears apparently decreased on the frontal view but given
 its size on the lateral it may be unchanged.  There is also a small pleural
 effusion on the left.  Interstitial opacification has increased somewhat. 
 Although differential considerations include atypical infectious processes,
 findings probably reflect mild pulmonary edema.  Aeration is better at the
 left lung base, but there is patchy increase in retrocardiac opacity.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased interstitial abnormality, not specific but suggesting mild
 pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increased opacity in posterior left lower lobe, probably atelectasis,
 although it is hard to exclude developing pneumonia.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
