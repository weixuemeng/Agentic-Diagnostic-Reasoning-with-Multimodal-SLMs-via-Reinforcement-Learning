                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a patchy
 opacity in the lateral right lower lung; atelectasis could be considered
 although contusion, pneumonia, or even aspiration in the appropriate setting. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No definite fracture is
 identified.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague suspected opacity in the right lower lung, probably
 compatible with atelectasis; other possibilities that could be considered in
 the appropriate setting are slight contusion or even developing pneumonia or
 aspiration.
