                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with sob  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest wall Port-A-Cath is again seen with catheter tip in the right
 atrium. Blunting of lateral costophrenic angles suggest small effusions as
 seen on prior. Increased bibasilar opacities are seen potentially due to
 atelectasis although developing infection is possible. More dense retrocardiac
 opacity silhouetting the descending thoracic aorta may represent infection.
 These findings are superimposed on diffuse increased interstitial markings
 which may represent edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial markings suggesting
 edema as on prior. Increased bibasilar opacities with more dense retrocardiac
 opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm may represent superimposed infection
 versus atelectasis. Consider PA and lateral views for better characterization.
