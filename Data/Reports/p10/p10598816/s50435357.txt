 The left Port-A-Cath catheter appears to be looping within the tributary of
 the left subclavian vein continuing down through the left brachiocephalic vein
 with its tip terminating at the level of cavoatrial junction.  The left-sided
 pneumothorax appears to be unchanged in size.  Left basal atelectasis is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well.
