                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP chest portable radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The fact that 2, thin parallel lines projecting high over the right apex are
 probably external artifact, rather than pneumothorax, can be confirmed with
 repeat chest radiograph after removal of all external materials.  There has
 been interval decrease in right pleural effusion.  Right middle and lower lobe
 are still collapsed.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion is
 again seen.  Nodular opacity in the left lung is a residual of pulmonary
 infarct, shown on the chest CTA, ___.  The heart is enlarged,
 though unchanged from prior.  Moderate hiatal hernia is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unlikely right apical pneumothorax can be confirmed by repeat chest
 radiograph after removing all external objects overlying the right upper
 chest.
 2. Continuing right middle and lower lobe collapse.  Volume of the right
 pleural effusion secondary to lobar collapse is indeterminate, but not large.
 3. Resolving left pulmonary infarct, persistent left lower lobe atelectasis
 and small left pleural effusion.
