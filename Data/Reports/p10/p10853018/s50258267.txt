                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, known lung CA and hx pleural effusions  //
 infiltrate or effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The loculated right pleural effusion is not dramatically changed since prior. 
 Right hilar/subcarinal mass was better seen on prior CT scan.  Right basilar
 opacity is likely component of potentially postobstructive atelectasis
 although infection would be difficult to exclude.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion.  Left lung is otherwise clear.  Moderate hiatal hernia is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Loculated right pleural effusion
 is again seen with persistent right basilar opacity.  Known infiltrative right
 hilar mass is better characterized on prior CT scan.
