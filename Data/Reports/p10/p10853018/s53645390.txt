                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung ca on right side, pleural effusion on
 left side, low O2 sats last week at 90% now with wheezing at office visit.  //
 pleural effusion worsening?     pleural effusion worsening?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there has been the development of a
 substantial left pleural effusion, which appears slightly less than the prior
 effusion on the right.  Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally with
 substantial volume loss in the lower lobes.
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  In view of the extensive pulmonary
 opacifications, it would be almost impossible to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
