                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R MPE. New L pleural effusion  // s/p L
 thoracentesis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval decrease in left base opacity, interval decrease in
 left pleural effusion, which appears essentially resolved.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  Patient is rotated somewhat
 to the right.  There has been interval increase in right mid to lower lung
 opacities which may in part relate to differences in patient positioning,
 however, there is concern for increasing right-sided pleural effusions.  Known
 subcarinal and right hilar masses better assessed on CT.
