                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, and the aorta is tortuous.  Chain sutures are
 noted within the right lower lung field, compatible with prior resection, with
 evidence of slight volume loss in the right lung as denoted by mild rightward
 shift of mediastinal structures.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation demonstrated.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged, and there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Multilevel degenerative changes are present within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence for pulmonary edema.  Postsurgical changes in the right lung lower
 lung field, and atelectasis in the lung bases.
