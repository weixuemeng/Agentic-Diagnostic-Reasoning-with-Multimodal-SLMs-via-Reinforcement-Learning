                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with one day of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  New subtle
 opacity at the right lung base in the setting of similar lung volumes with
 increased opacity on the lateral view may be atelectasis, but could represent
 early or developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity is probably atelectasis, but could
 represent early or developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
