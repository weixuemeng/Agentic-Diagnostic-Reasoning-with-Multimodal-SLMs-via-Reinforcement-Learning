                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia after surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Slight hyperinflation, chest CTA prior to surgery did not show emphysema.  It
 did show mild to moderately severe bronchiectasis, particularly in the left
 lower lobe.  Postoperatively, left lower lobe consolidation is probably due to
 atelectasis, stable since ___.  There is new peribronchial
 opacification on the right, conceivably aspiration.  Exacerbation of
 bronchiectasis is another possibility.  There is no pulmonary edema, and the
 upper lungs are clear.  Tiny left pleural effusion is of no clinical
 significance.  Heart size is normal.
