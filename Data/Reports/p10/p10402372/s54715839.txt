                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonia, now with increasing cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___,
 extent of peribronchial thickening and impaction of extensive bibasilar
 bronchiectasis may have increased slightly since the most recent prior lateral
 chest radiograph, ___.  There is really no change in the appearance of
 the frontal views as recently as ___.  Generalized hyperinflation is
 due to emphysema.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 consolidation.  A tiny right pleural effusion may be new, but probably not
 clinically significant.  Findings would therefore be attributed to
 decompensation of emphysema and bronchiectasis.
