                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, history of pseudomonas pneumonia, question new
 infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.  Heart size is
 borderline.  There is hazy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with a
 small left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate in this area.  Crowding
 of vessels in the right cardiophrenic region and left infrahilar regions are
 noted.  These findings are similar but slightly more pronounced compared with
 multiple earlier films and could reflect atelectasis, as well as patient's
 known bronchiectatic changes.  A Dobbhoff-type tube is present, extending
 beyond the inferior edge of the film -- the visualized segment of the
 radiopaque portion is seen overlying the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the differential would include a pneumonic
 infiltrate.  Findings discussed with the covering house officer on the
 afternoon of the exam.
