                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Patient
 has known bronchiectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally.  Bronchial wall
 thickening has worsened in the lower lobes bilaterally.  Faint patchy
 peribronchial opacities in the lower lobes, right greater than left, have also
 minimally increased.  This is consistent with worsening inflammatory or
 infectious process.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
