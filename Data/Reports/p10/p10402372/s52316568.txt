 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough, fever, rash and new oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated suggesting
 the presence of COPD.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion.  There is evidence of bronchial wall thickening in the
 lower lobes bilaterally, more so in the left consistent with bronchitis.  Of
 note, in ___ CT, there was evidence of an infection process in the
 lower lobes bilaterally; this has not worsened, probably improved.  The
 comparison is difficult due to the difference in technique.
