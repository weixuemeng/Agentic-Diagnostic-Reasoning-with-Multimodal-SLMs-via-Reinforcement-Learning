                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right ankle osteo, history of diabetes // preop
 CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Old subtle fracture deformity of the posterior lateral right
 seventh rib, stable, may be sequela of prior trauma.  8 mm sclerotic focus at
 the distal right clavicle is nonspecific, but could represent a bone island in
 the absence of history of malignancy.  However, this finding is more
 conspicuous as compared to chest radiograph from ___.  Correlate
 with history of malignancy.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlate with history of malignancy for the 8 mm
 sclerotic focus in the distal right clavicle which is nonspecific, but more
 conspicuous as compared to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Correlate with history of malignancy for the 8 mm sclerotic focus in the
