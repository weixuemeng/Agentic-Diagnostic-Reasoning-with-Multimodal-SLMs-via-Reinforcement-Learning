                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain status post fall, concerning for rib fracture.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  A pectus deformity of the
 chest cavity is noted.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  No acute fracture or dislocation is seen, although this study
 is not sensitive for chest cage trauma.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No acute fracture or
 dislocation, but this study is not sensitive for chest cage trauma.  If
 concern for fracture persists, detailed rib views in areas of carefully marked
 focal findings could be performed.
