                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p cvl  // s/p cvl
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ from 2 hours prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine radiograph shows interval placement of a left-sided subclavian
 line, the tip of which terminates in the upper to mid SVC.  An endotracheal
 tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina.  A transesophageal tube
 is seen, the tip is not visualized.  Supine technique exaggerates central
 pulmonary vasculature engorgement.  Again seen is a right basilar opacity, not
 significantly changed since the prior examination, which may represent
 aspiration or edema in the appropriate clinical context.  No definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though sensitivity is limited on
 supine film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left subclavian line terminating in the proximal to mid SVC.  Otherwise
 largely unchanged examination with right basilar opacity which, in the
 appropriate clinical context, may represent aspiration/a component of edema.
