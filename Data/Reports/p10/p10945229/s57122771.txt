                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fall and mild hypoxia.  Evaluation for rib
 fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are
 hyperexpanded, consistent with underlying COPD.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  The
 heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is tortuous, as before.  Median
 sternotomy wires and vascular clips are again seen.   A tendon anchor is
 present in the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Emphysema.  Conventional chest radiography
 is insensitive for the detection of rib fractures, and if clinically
 suspected, dedicated rib views are recommended.
