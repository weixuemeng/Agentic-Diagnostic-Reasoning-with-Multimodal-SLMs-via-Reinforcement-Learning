                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, hypotension  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs the most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette size remains mild to moderately
 enlarged. The mediastinal contour is stable. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis
 though consider followup PA and lateral views of the chest with improved
 inspiratory effort for better assessment of this region.
