 re-assess ETT position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube lies approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well
 into the stomach.  Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure. Part of the haziness of the lower lungs could be a
 manifestation of scatter radiation related to the size of the patient.
