                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including cardiac
 enlargement.  There is a persistent pleural effusion on the left, but with
 substantial decrease. Parenchymal opacification involving the left lower lobe
 and probably the lingula persists but similar to improved and not optimally
 assessed with this technique.  The left lung apex, as well as the entirety of
 the right lung ,appear well-aerated and clear, as before.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Reduced pleural effusion on the left without persistent opacification at the
 left lung base, compatible with pneumonia in the appropriate setting. 
 However, even if pneumonia were successfully treated, it might take several
 more weeks for the opacity to clear more definitely.  Atelectasis is also a
 differential diagnosis.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 clearance within ___ weeks.
