                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, presenting status post syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no
 overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Minimal streaky opacities are seen in
 the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Mild to moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
