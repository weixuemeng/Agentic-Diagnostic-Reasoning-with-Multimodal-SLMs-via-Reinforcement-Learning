                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG with high chest tube output.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a somewhat better inspiration.  Opacification at the left base is again
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. 
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged and the right lung is
 clear.
