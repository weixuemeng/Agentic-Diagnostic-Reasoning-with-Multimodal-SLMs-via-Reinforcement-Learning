                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lightheadedness, status post CABG, question pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate
 interval removal of the right IJ central venous catheter.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is small amount of
 residual pleural fluid tracking along the fissure on the left, likely
 accounting for the hazy minimal opacity projecting over the left hemithorax. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Heart size is top normal, though this is
 unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Chronic deformity and
 post-surgical changes of the right AC joint noted.  Otherwise, bony structures
 appear unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace pleural fluid on the left tracking along the fissure,
 overall improved from prior.   Otherwise, no acute abnormalities.
