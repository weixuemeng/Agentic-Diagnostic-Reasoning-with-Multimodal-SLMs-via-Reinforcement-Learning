                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Increased AP diameter of the chest
 with flattened hemidiaphragms suggest COPD, unchanged from prior. 
 Bronchiectasis and peribronchial opacities have progressed in the left lower
 lobe and may reflect aspiration or inflammation.  No confluent consolidation
 is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperexpanded lungs with increased left lower lobe peribronchial
 opacities, possible interval aspiration.
