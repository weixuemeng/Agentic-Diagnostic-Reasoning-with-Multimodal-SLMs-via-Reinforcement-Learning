                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // eval for chf or pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyper inflated, suggesting background COPD.  There is moderate
 to moderately severe cardiomegaly.  There are diffusely increased interstitial
 markings, of indeterminate acuity.  The possibility of mild right hilar
 prominence cannot be excluded.  The left hilum is obscured by overlying
 structures.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly,
 consistent with small bilateral effusions.  There is a 9.9 mm rounded nodular
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, not definitively identified on the
 lateral view.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable background COPD.
 2. Moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly.
 3. Diffusely increased interstitial markings.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could represent CHF and small bilateral effusions are noted. 
 However, depending on the clinical presentation, the differential diagnosis
 includes other etiologies for increased interstitial markings, including
 atypical infection, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.
 4. Possible prominence of the right hilum.  Attention to this area after
 resolution of acute symptoms is requested.
 5. Nodular opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  The possibility of a
 pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Again, attention to this area after
 resolution of acute symptoms is requested.  Unless this proves to be a
 calcified granuloma or something on the patient's skin, then further
 evaluation with chest CT would be recommended.
