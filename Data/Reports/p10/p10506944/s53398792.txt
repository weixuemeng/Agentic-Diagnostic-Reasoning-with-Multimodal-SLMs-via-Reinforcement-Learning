                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, the
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  There are bilateral effusions
 with compressive atelectasis at the bases and some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  There is some
 prominence of the left hilar region.  It is unclear whether this is merely a
 reflection of central edema or a sign of an infectious or even neoplastic
 process.  This area should be closely scrutinized on subsequent images.
 
 There is some area of increased opacification in the retrocardiac region on
 the lateral view.  This overlies the somewhat calcified aorta and may merely
 reflect superimposed normal markings.  However, if there is serious concern
 for infectious process, an area of consolidation could be considered.
