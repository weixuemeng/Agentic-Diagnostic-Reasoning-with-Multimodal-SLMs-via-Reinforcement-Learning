                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures, right-sided pneumothorax after accident,
 clamp tube, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, 5:02 a.m.
 
 Right-sided chest tube is present.  Compared to the previous film and allowing
 for differences in positioning, no definite change is detected.  
 
 Again seen is relatively small volume of the right lung, with multiple rib
 fractures and some pleural fluid and/or thickening and patchy opacity at the
 right lung base, with some additional markings throughout the right lung.  No
 increased effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Mediastinum and left lung are probably unchanged, with band-like atelectasis
 noted at the left lung base medially.  
 
 Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the lower right chest
 wall.  This is similar to findings on a ___ radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval clamping of chest tube.  No gross change identified.
