 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:07 PM
  Right pleural tube is in stable position. Lung volumes are low and there is
  bibasilar atelectasis, but no enlarging pleural effusion. Multiple right rib
  fractures and right apical thickening again noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate chest tube, question increase in effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 A right-sided chest tube is present.  Apparent epidural catheter is present.
 
 Positioning is rotated, more so than on the prior film.  Allowing for this,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Again seen is diminished size of the right hemithorax, with multiple rib
 fractures.  There is some pleural thickening along the right apex and lateral
 chest wall as well as blunting of the costophrenic angle.  The degree of
 blunting has not grossly changed.  Asymmetric prominence of the vascular
 markings on the right is probably similar, allowing for differences in film
 technique.  The left lung shows atelectasis at the base, with minimal blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle, slightly worse.  No obvious pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Right chest tube present.  No definite change in right-sided pleural
 effusion, allowing for differences in positioning.  
 2) Minimal atelectasis and blunting of the left costophrenic angle is slightly
 worse compared with ___.
