                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube projects over the base of the right hemithorax.  There is a small
 quantity of subcutaneous emphysema but no indication of substantial
 pneumothorax.  A trace pneumothorax is suspected, however, on the right. 
 There is no evidence for pleural effusion.  The lungs appear clear.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the
 limitations of technique. Right second through fourth rib fractures are
 markedly displaced.  There are also non-displaced fractures involving right
 posterior sixth and seventh ribs although the age of the latter fractures is
 difficult to assess.  Given the limitations of technique, additional injuries
 are difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly displaced right second through fourth rib fractures. Right-sided
 chest tube in place with no substantial pneumothorax.
