                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polytrauma, rib fractures, right pneumothorax, right shoulder AC
 separation, right tibial plateau fracture status post ORIF.  Evaluate rib
 fracture, pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:55 p.m..
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The chest tube at the right lung base is again seen.  No definitive
 pneumothorax is identified.  Compared with ___, findings are similar, with
 possible very subtle increased opacity seen in the right lung midzone compared
 to the prior film.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 unchanged, consistent with a small effusion. Relative small size of the right
 hemithorax is unchanged.  Extensive rib fractures in the right upper chest and
 separation of the right AC joint again noted.  On the left, band-like
 atelectasis, with tenting of the left hemidiaphragm and minimal blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, is similar.  The degree of vascular plethora is
 also similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No definite change.  No gross pneumothorax.  
 
 2) Possible faint increased opacity in the right mid zone -- ? area of
 hemorrhage or pleural fluid.  Attention to this area on followup films is
 recommended, as any perceived difference between the two films is subtle.
