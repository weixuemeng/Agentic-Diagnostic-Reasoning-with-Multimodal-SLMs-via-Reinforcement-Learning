                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube again projects along the right lower hemithorax.  There is
 probably a small right apical pneumothorax but not well visualized. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema appears unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion.  Several right-sided
 rib fractures are better demonstrated on a recent prior CT. The right
 acromioclavicular joint is widened.  There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite short-term change in the appearance of the chest.
