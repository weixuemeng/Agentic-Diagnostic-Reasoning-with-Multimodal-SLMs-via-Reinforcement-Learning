                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man ___ with poly trauma, rib fractures,
 hemopneumothorax,  // assess for hemopneumothorax since chest tube to water
 seal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, no obvious change is detected involving the
 right lung. Again seen is a right chest tube, with some stable blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and overall decreased size of the right chest, with
 multiple rib fractures again noted.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 Markings in the right chest are similar to the prior film, without frank,
 focal consolidation.
 
 There is a small left effusion, which is slight increased compared with the
 prior film, and minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, similar to the
 prior film.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged, but appears slightly
 decreased in size compared to the prior film. It remains midline. Tortuous
 aorta is unchanged. Azygos vein is probably decreased in size.
 
 Apparent interval removal of an epidural catheter.
 
 The current film includes the AC joint, which is clearly separated, with
 elevation of the distal clavicle with respect to the acromion and associated
 widening of the AC joint and coracoclavicular interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right chest, including minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, 
 essentially unchanged. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Multiple right-sided rib fracture again noted. AC joint separation again
 noted (previously seen on right shoulder radiographs from ___).
 3. Small left pleural effusion slightly increased.  Continued minimal
 atelectasis of left base.
 4. Apparent slight improvement in cardiomegaly and interval normalization of
 previously distended right azygos vein.
