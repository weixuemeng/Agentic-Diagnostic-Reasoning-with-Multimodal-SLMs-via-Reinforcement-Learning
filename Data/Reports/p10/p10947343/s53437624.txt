                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of rib fracture.  Now with fall and
 worsening rib pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 clear of focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette
 is at upper limits of normal.  Median sternotomy wires.  Posterior left
 seventh and eighth rib fractures are identified, which are not necessarily
 acute given suggestion of some absorption of the fracture sites; however,
 clinical correlation is suggested.  No definitely acute displaced rib
 fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Posterior left
 seventh and eighth rib fractures, which may be recent but not necessarily
 acute; however, clinical correlation is suggested.
