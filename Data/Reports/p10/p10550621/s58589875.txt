                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening hypoxia, decreased breath sounds on right.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, some of the apparent change
 may reflect the supine rather than PA upright view.  There are bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the right with underlying compressive
 atelectasis.  Continued right hilar mass with areas of opacification adjacent
 and possible air bronchograms.  This could reflect secondary infectious
 change.  There is also hazy opacification in the left mid zone.  Although
 overlying scapula may be contributing to this appearance, the possibility of
 an infectious process in this region must also be considered.  Another
 possibility could be some central vascular congestion related to
 overhydration.
