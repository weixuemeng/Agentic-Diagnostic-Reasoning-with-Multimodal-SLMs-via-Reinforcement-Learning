                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer with worsening hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Right hilar
 opacity is progressed when compared to the prior chest radiograph, likely
 reflecting a combination of the patient's known malignancy with right middle
 and lower lobe collapse though infection is not excluded.  A small pleural
 effusion on the right appears increased when compared to the prior study. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Streaky opacity in the left
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Known hiatal hernia is better seen on the prior CT. No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.  Levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 unchanged.  Ring-like calcification in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen
 is compatible with a calcified splenic artery aneurysm, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening right hilar opacification likely reflecting the patient's known
 malignancy with right middle and lower lobe collapse, though infection is not
 excluded.  Interval increase in size of small right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
