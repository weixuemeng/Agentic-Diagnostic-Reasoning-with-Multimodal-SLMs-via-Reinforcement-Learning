                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.  Question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS: ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is substantial elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 associated opacification that may be due to pleural effusions and atelectasis.
 This study indicates that the pleural effusion component is similar to perhaps
 slightly smaller.  The left lung remains clear.  There is no evidence for
 pleural effusion on the left.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with suspected pleural
 effusion, not incompletely characterized, although apparently similar to
 decreased.  A decubitus view or CT could be helpful to evaluate how much of
 the appearance is truly due to pleural effusion if needed clinically.
