                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LEFT LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lung carcinoid, admitted for
 chemotherapy, now with cough, question infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ and
 ___.  Best selected images from a CT chest study performed on ___. 
 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The left lung remains well inflated and clear.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with opacification at the right base
 which appears stable but likely represents a combination of right middle and
 lower lobe collapse as well as a mass with a small pleural effusion as
 evidenced on the CT study of ___.  Overall, the appearance of the chest
 has not changed.  The aerated right lung is unremarkable.  Cardiac size is
 difficult to assess but the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
