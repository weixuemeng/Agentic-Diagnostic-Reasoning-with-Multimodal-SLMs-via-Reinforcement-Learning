                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of several SBO's presenting with high grade SBO,
 hypotension and elevated lactate now s/p ex-lap, SBR, left in discontinuity. 
 // Interval assesment     Interval assesment
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  There are lower lung volumes, which accentuate the
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic
 contour is again seen with atelectatic changes above it.  Central
 opacifications on the left probably represent engorged pulmonary vessels
 related to low lung volumes, essence on the right there is no evidence of
 substantial vascular congestion.
