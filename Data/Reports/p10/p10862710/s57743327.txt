                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left sided weakness, hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears borderline enlarged. Additionally, low lung volumes cause
 apparent widening of the superior mediastinum, but the aortic knob appears
 distinct. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted without overt
 pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Apparent superior mediastinal widening is likely related to
 the presence of low lung volumes, but repeat PA and lateral views with
 improved inspiratory effort is recommended. No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality otherwise noted.
