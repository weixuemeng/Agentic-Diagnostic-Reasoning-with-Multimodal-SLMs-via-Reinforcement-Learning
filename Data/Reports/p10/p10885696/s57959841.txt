                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 UPRIGHT FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The patient is status post
 left upper lobectomy, with expected persistent left lung volume loss and shift
 of mediastinal structures.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 unchanged, allowing for differences in technique and rotation of the patient. 
 Biapical scarring is again seen.  There is no pneumothorax or new
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: Post left upper lobectomy changes,  with no superimposed acute
 intrathoracic process detected.
