                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Tracheostomy tube and postoperative changes of left upper
 lobectomy are again seen.  Right basilar opacity silhouettes the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Superiorly, the right lung is clear and appearance of the left
 lung is stable.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable as do the osseous
 and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, possibly
 due to any combination of effusion, atelectasis or consolidation.  Clinical
 correlation recommended.  Two-view chest x-ray may also offer additional
 detail.
