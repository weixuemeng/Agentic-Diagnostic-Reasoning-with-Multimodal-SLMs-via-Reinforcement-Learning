                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bicycle accident trauma.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.  Extreme right inferior chest wall
 excluded from the film.  Trauma board artifact present.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but likely exaggerated by AP supine
 technique.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. 
 No apical capping is identified.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is
 identified.  No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected. There is
 suggestion of very slight asymmetry of the sternoclavicular joints, wider on
 the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Prominence of the cardiac silhouette likely related to technique. No acute
 pulmonary process identified. 
 2) Slight assymetry of sternoclavicular joints.
