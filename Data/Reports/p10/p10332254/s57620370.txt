                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette is less pronounced.  There is some fullness, especially in
 the right hilar area that could represent some asymmetric elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Some increased opacification in the retrocardiac
 region on the lateral view could possibly be an indication for acute
 pneumonia.  There is also mild asymmetry in the right mid zone that could
 reflect an infectious process.
