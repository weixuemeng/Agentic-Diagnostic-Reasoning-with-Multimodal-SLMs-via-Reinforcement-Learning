 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, the inspiratory lung
 volumes are slightly decreased.  There is no focal consolidation concerning
 for pneumonia.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on
 this single frontal view.  The pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct,
 suggesting minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged allowing for slight patient rotation on the current study. 
 There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, stable
