                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, status post chest tube
 removal, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 7:26.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 11:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left chest tube.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with
 stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm with some adjacent streaky opacities, suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small
 effusion.  There is also possibly a tiny right pleural effusion.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
