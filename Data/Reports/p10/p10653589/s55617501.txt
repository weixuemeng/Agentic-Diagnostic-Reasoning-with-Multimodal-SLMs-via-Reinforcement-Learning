                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, congestive heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with single lead terminating in the region of
 the right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is present.  Marked mitral annular
 calcifications are seen.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mild upper zone
 vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness suggests mild pulmonary edema. 
 Large right and small left bilateral pleural effusions are noted with
 associated compressive bibasilar atelectasis.  Ring like opacities projecting
 over the right hilum may reflect bronchiectasis.  Additionally the lungs
 appear hyperinflated which is supportive of underlying chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with large right and small left bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis.
