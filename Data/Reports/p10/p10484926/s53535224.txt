                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain, question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are
 likely atelectasis.  Irregular lucent opacity with dense borders overlying the
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes is likely artifact.  The bones are intact. 
 There is no evidence of free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process or free air. Likely artifact
 projecting over the cardiac silhouette.  Can obtain repeat film for further
 clarification.
