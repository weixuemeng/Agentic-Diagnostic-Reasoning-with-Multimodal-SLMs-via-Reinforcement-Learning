                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, status post chest tube removal, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Compared with ___ at 15:23 p.m., ET tube, NG tube, right IJ central line,
 and left-sided chest tube have been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is
 more pronounced, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. 
 On today's exam, there is also a small right pleural effusion which may extend
 into the minor fissure.  This likely account for hazy opacity at the right
 base, though the possibility of some underlying atelectasis cannot be
 excluded.  Doubt overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumothorax detected status post removal of chest tube.
 2.  New small-to-moderate-sized right pleural effusion with underlying
 atelectasis.
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation significantly progressed
 compared with ___, with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Possible small left effusion.
