 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, COPD, pleural effusions p/w dyspnea  //
 eval effusions, consolidations
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight increase in mid to lower lung opacities due to moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis ; associated moderate pulmonary
 edema is seen as well.  Underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude
 although no discrete focal consolidation is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis with mid to
 lower lung opacities increased compared to the prior study.  Moderate
