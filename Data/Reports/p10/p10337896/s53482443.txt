 Please evaluate for interval change in bilateral pleural eff
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14 59
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged
 position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal
 esophagus but the tip is not identified. Multiple calcified lymph nodes,
 multiple bilateral calcified parenchymal opacities and pleural calcifications
 are unchanged consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Given the
 extensive parenchymal abnormality, this does limit the sensitivity of plain
 radiography.  Bilateral apical pleural thickening, left greater than right,
 which is unchanged. There are stable bilateral layering effusions, left
 greater than right, with probable associated compressive atelectasis in the
 lower lobes.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Heart remains stably enlarged. 
 Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes with deformity of the left humeral
 head.
