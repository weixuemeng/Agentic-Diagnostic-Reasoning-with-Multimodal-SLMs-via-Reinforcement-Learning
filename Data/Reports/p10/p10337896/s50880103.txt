                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on trach collar s/p sepsis (likely PNA source) in
 SICU.  // eval infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, and
 chest CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings on the chest CT ___ showed probable multi focal pneumonia,
 predominantly in the right lung, and mild interstitial edema. Edema improved
 between ___ and ___, and then opacification in the right lung
 increased again accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion. The
 progression of these associated findings this suggested that the interval
 change was primarily due to cardiac decompensation. Today edema has worsened
 in both lungs, and the moderate right pleural effusion is larger, although the
 opacification in the left lower lung is heterogeneous enough to suggest
 concurrent pneumonia or large scale aspiration. . Mild cardiomegaly and
 chronic mediastinal widening are chronic.
