                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the left mid lung does not persist on repeat frontal view
 and thus unlikely to reflect acute pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
