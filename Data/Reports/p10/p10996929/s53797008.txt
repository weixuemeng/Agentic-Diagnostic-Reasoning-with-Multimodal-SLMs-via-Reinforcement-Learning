                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and chest pain.  Study obtained prior to VQ
 scan.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuates bronchovascular markings.  There is no pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Linear opacity in the left lung base likely
 represents atelectasis.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. 
 Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Moderate hiatal hernia is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
