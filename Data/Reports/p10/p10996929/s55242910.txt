                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Clinical deterioration, requiring intubation, here to evaluate ET
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to significant patient rotation at the
 neck.  Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube is in place with the tip
 terminating 4.5 cm above the carina.  A right Port-A-Cath is in place with the
 tip in the proximal right atrium.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low with
 resultant bronchovascular crowding and exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this
 supine AP view.  The left lung base is opacified, which likely reflects
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion and Kerley B line suggesting mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip 4.5 cm above the carina.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Probable left basilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
