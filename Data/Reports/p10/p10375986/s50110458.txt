                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.
 The aorta is tortuous.  Bilateral hilar enlargement may suggest underlying
 lymphadenopathy of pulmonary arterial enlargement.  Right pleural thickening
 or fluid is seen along the minor fissure. Streaky opacity in the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis. No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, and the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  No displaced fractures are identified. There is marked gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Streaky left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis.
 3. Thickening of the right minor fissure could be due to fluid.
 4. Gaseous distention of the stomach for which enteric tube placement is
 recommended.
