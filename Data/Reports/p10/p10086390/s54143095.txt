                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever to 103, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion which is similar to the
 prior examination of ___.  There is opacification in the
 retrocardiac area which may represent layering pleural effusion with adjacent
 compressive atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia appears
 more likely.  Biapical parenchymal scarring is noted.  There is near total
 resolution of the right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pleural effusion with consolidation. Repeat
 imaging post treatment to document resolution and rule out underlying mass.
