                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, now with tachypnea and wheezing.  Rule out
 obstruction, aspiration pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:28 p.m.
 
 Again seen is a right-sided PICC line, with tip over the proximal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is cardiomegaly, with prominence of the pulmonary arteries, with a tapered
 appearance, which can reflect pulmonary hypertension.  The aorta is calcified
 and slightly unfolded.  There is borderline upper zone re-distribution,
 without other evidence of CHF.  There is some patchy opacity at both lung
 bases, unchanged.  No gross effusion is seen on either side.  Possible minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle. 
 
 IMPRESSION:   Bibasilar patchy opacities, unchanged compared with ___. 
 Differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, particularly given stability over
 time.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the ddx could include aspiration
 pneumonitis or early pneumonia, but these are  considered less likely.
