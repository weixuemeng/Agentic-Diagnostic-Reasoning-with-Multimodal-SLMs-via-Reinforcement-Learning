                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent serotonin
 syndrome and persistent fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been obvious evidence of overall improvement
 of widespread parenchymal opacities that are involving both lungs with nodular
 patchy pattern and no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 the findings might be consistent with gradual improvement of both previously
 demonstrated pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
