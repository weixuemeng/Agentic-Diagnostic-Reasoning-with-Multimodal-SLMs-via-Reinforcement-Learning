                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post suicide attempt and aspiration. 
 Assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate interval increase in diffuse bilateral heterogeneous
 opacities with air bronchograms and focal increased opacity in the right lower
 lobe.  Heart size, mediastinal contour are obscured by the pleural parenchymal
 process.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Worsening diffuse pulmonary opacities, which appear to wax and wane on
 serial radiographs, most likely due to pulmonary edema.  Consider followup
 chest radiographs to assess for clearing status post diuresis.
 
 2. Focal right lower lobe opacity may be related to history of aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 Results conveyed to the primary team by Dr. ___ on ___
 at 1:20 p.m. within five minutes of observation of findings.
