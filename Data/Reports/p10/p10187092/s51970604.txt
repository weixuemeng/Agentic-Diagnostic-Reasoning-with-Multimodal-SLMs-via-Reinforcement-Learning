                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for hypercarbic respiratory arrest status post transfer
 from outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying and terminates approximately 2.8
 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes are noted.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears to be present. 
 Opacity within the retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  A possible trace left pleural
 effusion is noted.  The right lung is free of consolidation.  No right-sided
 pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  S-shaped scoliosis of
 the thoracolumbar spine is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though
 aspiration or infection is not excluded.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3. Endotracheal tube is slightly low lying, terminating 2.8 cm from the
 carina.
