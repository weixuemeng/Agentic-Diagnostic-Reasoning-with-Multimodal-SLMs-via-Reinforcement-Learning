                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever to 105 degrees.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Clips are noted within the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.
