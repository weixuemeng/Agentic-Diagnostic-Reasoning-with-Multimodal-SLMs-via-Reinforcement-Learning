                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:
 CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There are
 streaky opacities at the left lung base but decreased compared to the prior
 study, most suggestive of improving atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. Internal-external biliary drains have been revised in two
 internal drains.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement in opacification at the left lung base. Interval exchange of
 internal-external for internal biliary drains.
