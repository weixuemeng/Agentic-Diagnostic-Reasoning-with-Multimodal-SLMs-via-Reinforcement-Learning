 PA AND LATERAL CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Lung volumes remain low.  Bibasilar lung opacities have rapidly
 improved, with residual opacity most prominent in the right lower lobe
 retrocardiac region.  Additional residual linear opacities are also
 demonstrated.  No new areas of consolidation are present, and there are no
 definite pleural effusions.
