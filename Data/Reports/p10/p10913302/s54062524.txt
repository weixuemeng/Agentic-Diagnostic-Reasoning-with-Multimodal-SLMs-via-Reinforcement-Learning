                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AML complicated by GvHD now with subjective
 fever, abdominal pain  // ?  Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC/right
 atrial junction.  Low lung volumes accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged but similar.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  A small right pleural effusion is unchanged compared to the
 previous chest CT.  No focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple remote bilateral rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small right pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes without focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
