                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, here to evaluate for acute injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report of chest radiograph performed on ___.  No
 prior images are available for comparison due to inability of PACS to fetch
 images from archive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are significantly decreased, which
 accentuates the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is well visualized, and the right costophrenic angle is clear. 
 The left hemidiaphragm is obscured, which likely reflects a combination of
 pleural fluid and associated atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, related in part to lung
 under-inflation.  Scant calcification of the aortic knob is noted.  The
 trachea is deviated to the right by the aortic knob.  No displaced rib
 fractures are detected; however, evaluation is limited due to
 underpenetration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
 2.  No displaced rib fractures; however, a dedicated rib series should be
 obtained if there is clinical concern.
