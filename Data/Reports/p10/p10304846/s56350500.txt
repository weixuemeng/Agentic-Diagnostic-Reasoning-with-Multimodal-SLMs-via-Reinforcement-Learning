                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cough, please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is opacification at the lung bases likely secondary to
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion.  Scant calcification of the aortic
 knob is again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous
 structures demonstrate marked degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but infectious
 process cannot be excluded.
