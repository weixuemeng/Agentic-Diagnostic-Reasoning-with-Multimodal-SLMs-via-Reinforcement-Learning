                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Minimal aortic knob calcifications are
 demonstrated.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Minimal
 leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is likely due to a
 right thyroid goiter, as seen on the prior CT.  There are mild atelectatic
 changes in the lung bases.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
