                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 7:26.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stab to left chest and axilla, left
 chest tube to suction.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 11:48.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 7:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left chest tube remains in place.  There has been interval decrease in size
 but a persistent small left apical pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low.  There
 continues to be patchy opacity in the left mid lung that may represent an area
 of hemorrhage or resolving contusion.  The right hemidiaphragm is slightly
 elevated, suggesting that there is likely atelectasis at the right base as
 well.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.
