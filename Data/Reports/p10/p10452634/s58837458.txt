                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wound to the chest with left-sided pneumothorax, evaluation for
 interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The previously noted endotracheal tube has since been removed.  Previously
 noted left-sided chest tube appear stable in position.  Lucency is noted
 overlying the left diaphragm and suggestive of small left pneumothorax.  
 
 Previously noted left-sided opacity persists and likely represents a
 combination of previously noted left hemothorax as well as adjacent
 atelectasis/trauma in the region of the chest tube. There are now increased
 right basilar opacities which may represent atelectasis/new developing
 infectious process. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left pneumothorax is again noted. Left-sided chest tube appears
 stable in position. 
 
 2.  Increased right basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis versus a
 new developing infectious process on the right.
 
 3.  Persistent left-sided opacities. These findings are likely representative
 of persisting left hemothorax and adjacent atelectasis/trauma in the region of
 chest tube. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 the time of discovery at 9:35 am on ___.
