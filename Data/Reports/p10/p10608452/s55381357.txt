                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain  // assess for intra-abdominal
 free air, please do upright CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low which results in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is present. 
 Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is no subdiaphragmatic
 free air.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and possible trace
 right pleural effusion.
