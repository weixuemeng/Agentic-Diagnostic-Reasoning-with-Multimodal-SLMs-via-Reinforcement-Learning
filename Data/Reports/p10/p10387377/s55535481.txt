 angle and suggestive of effusion and possible associated atelectasis. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are
 the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small persistent left basilar opacity suggestive of small
 effusion and possible atelectasis.  Two-view chest x-ray may offer additional
