                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:33 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman transferred from an outside hospital for presumed
 COPD exacerbation and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new, but there is no pulmonary edema. 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the
 left lung could be early pneumonia, but is also readily explained by mild
 atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.  Conventional radiographs
 recommended when feasible for a more complete evaluation.  Mild cardiomegaly
 stable.  No pneumothorax.
