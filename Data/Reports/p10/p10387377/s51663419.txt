 EXAMINATION:  AP chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD and CHF now with worsening oxygen
 requirement  // please assess for interval change      please assess for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema, vascular congestion and small pleural effusions
 have improved reflecting decreasing cardiac decompensation.  Chronic moderate
 cardiomegaly with a configuration suggesting particular left atrial
 enlargement, is unchanged.
 
 There may be new small region of opacification in the axillary areas of both
 upper lungs.  I would recommend repeat upright chest radiographs with
 overlying devices removed, in order to look for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute
 pulmonary embolism.  .
