                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the jugular
 catheter remains in place.  Some opacification is again seen at the bases,
 more prominent on the right.  Although this could reflect merely atelectasis,
 the possibility of superimposed pneumonia must be seriously considered.  No
 evidence of congestive failure.
