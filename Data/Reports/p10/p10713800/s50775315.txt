 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid
 superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Heart size is slightly
 increased and is accompanied by new distention of the azygos vein.  New
 bibasilar opacities are present, more confluent on the right than the left,
 and note is also made of a few basilar septal lines.  There is also an
 apparent new small right pleural effusion extending into the minor fissure. 
 These findings could be due to fluid overload or transfusion related acute
 lung injury.
