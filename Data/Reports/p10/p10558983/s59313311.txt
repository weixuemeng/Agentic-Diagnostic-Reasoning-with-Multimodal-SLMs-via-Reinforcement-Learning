                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post trauma.  Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:12 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lying ET tube
 with tip 3.6 cm below the upper margin of the clavicle, extending to the
 region of the carina, likely accentuated by kyphotic position of the patient. 
 This could be retracted by 1-1.5 cm cm to ensure safe positioning.  An enteric
 tube traverses below the diaphragm out of view.  The lung volumes are low,
 accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly low lying endotracheal tube.  Recommend retraction by
 1-1.5 cm to optimize safe positioning.
