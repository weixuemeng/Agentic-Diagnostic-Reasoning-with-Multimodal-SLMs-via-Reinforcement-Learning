                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ screw ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes have improved and left infrahilar opacification has decreased. 
 The improvement is due to resolving atelectasis but the residual consolidation
 at both lung bases left greater than right is still of concern for pneumonia. 
 The perihilar right lung appears newly edematous.  Heart is borderline
 enlarged, but the mediastinal vasculature is not clearly abnormal.  ET tube is
 in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the mid portion of
 nondistended stomach.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.   Bibasilar pneumonia not excluded. 
 New mild pulmonary edema.  Lines and tubes in standard placements.
