                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elevated white count, presenting with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal with a mildly tortuous aorta.  Hilar
 contours are normal.  There has been interval significant improvement in
 interstitial edema and pulmonary congestion.  A subtle focus of increased
 opacity remains in the right mid-to-upper lung.  Left lung is clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Residual barium within the GI tract
 projects over the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of interstitial edema but with subtle
 focus of opacity in the right mid-to-upper lung which may represent asymmetric
 clearing of edema; however, given history, this is suspicious for infection.
