                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NGT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower body of the stomach. 
 Endotracheal tube has been removed.  Continued low lung volumes may have some
 effect on the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
