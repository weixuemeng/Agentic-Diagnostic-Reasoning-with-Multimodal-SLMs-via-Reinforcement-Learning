                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Trauma.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube is too high, at the thoracic inlet; it should be advanced at least
 3 cm.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged.  No interval development of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or
 consolidations has been demonstrated.
 
 Of note is that the endotracheal tube cuff is hyperextended and should also be
 readjusted after advancement of the ET tube.
