                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with intra-abdominal trauma evaluate pulmonary
 edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes remain very low.  Mild edema has substantially cleared in the
 right lung.   On the left there is substantial lower lobe atelectasis and at
 least a moderate pleural effusion, so 1 would expect less clearing of edema. 
 With the chin down, ET tube at the thoracic inlet, though no less than 2 cm
 from the carina is probably optimally placed.  An upper enteric drainage tube
 is traceable only as far as the mid esophagus, although it may go further. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from exaggerated
 by persistently low lung volumes.
