                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer, now with possible edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs,
 which could reflect some chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Dual-channel pacer device is in place
 with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.
