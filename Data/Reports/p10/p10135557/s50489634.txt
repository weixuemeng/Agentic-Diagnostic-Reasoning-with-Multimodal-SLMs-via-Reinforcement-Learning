                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new CVL in R IJ  // IJ  placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid
 to lower SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5
 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube is not well seen beyond the midchest. 
 There is moderate pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mild to
 moderately enlarged.  Left base opacity may be due to atelectasis although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.
