  Distal aspect of endotracheal tube difficult to accurately assess but likely
  terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.
  
  Enteric tube courses into the lower chest is not well seen distally; suggest
  repeat with image centered along the lower chest to better assess position of
  the distal enteric tube.
  
  Moderate pulmonary edema.
  
  Slightly prominent mediastinum may relate to pulmonary hypertension.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with resp failure  // eval for tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:

 terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses into
 the lower chest, but is not well seen distally.  Suggest repeat with the image
 centered along the lower chest tp better assess position of enteric tube.
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinum is slightly prominent which may relate to
 pulmonary hypertension.  There is moderate pulmonary edema.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
