                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory distress.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Multiple plate and screws overlie the chest in the midline presumably related
 to a sternotomy procedure.  There are slightly low inspiratory volumes but I
 suspect background COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, but no overt CHF.  A
 small right pleural effusion is again noted.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is new.  No frank consolidation identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular plethora.  Small right and left effusions.
