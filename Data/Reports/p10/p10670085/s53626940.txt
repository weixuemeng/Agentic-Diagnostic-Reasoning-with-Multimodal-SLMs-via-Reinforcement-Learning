                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Sternal brackets and fusion devices are again re- demonstrated, in unchanged
 position.  Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the
 cardiac silhouette which is moderately enlarged.  The patient is status post
 aortic valve replacement.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle appears chronic, and may be due to a small right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  Remote right-sided rib
 fracture is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable small right
 pleural effusion.
