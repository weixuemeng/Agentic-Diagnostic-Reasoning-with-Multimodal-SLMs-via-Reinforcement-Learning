                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is mild increase in the interstitial
 markings suggesting mild interstitial edema.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  Thoracic scoliosis is again
 noted.  The aorta remains calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  A linear radiopaque structure is seen projecting over the lower
 neck, unclear whether internal or external to the patient.  There is diffuse
 osteopenia, and there are degenerative changes at both shoulder and
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in the interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally,
 mild interstitial edema.
