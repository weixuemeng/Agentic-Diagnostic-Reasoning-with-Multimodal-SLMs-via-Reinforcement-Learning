  Patchy bilateral mid to lower lung opacities appear slightly increased as
  compared to the prior study, particularly in the left lower lobe, worrisome
  for worsened multifocal pneumonia, slightly progressed on the left.
  
  Findings involve bilateral lower lobes and possibly right middle lobe and/or
  lingula.
  
  Gaseous distention of partially imaged bowel.

 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities appear slightly increased as compared to
 the prior study, particularly in the left lower lobe.  Patchy opacities
 involve the mid to lower lungs bilaterally.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 There is gaseous distention of partially imaged bowel.
