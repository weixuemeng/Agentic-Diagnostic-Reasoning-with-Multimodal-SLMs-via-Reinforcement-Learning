                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever, please evaluate for infectious
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is mildly enlarged. There are mild bibasilar opacities
 suggestive of atelectasis, left greater than right. Increased opacity at the
 right lung base could also relate to supervening early infection.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.   
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased right basal lung opacity may be due to atelectasis, but
 follow up CXR may be helpful to exclude early infection.
