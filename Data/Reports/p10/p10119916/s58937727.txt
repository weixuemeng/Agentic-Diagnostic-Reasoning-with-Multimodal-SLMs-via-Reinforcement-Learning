                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with interval gain of ___ pounds,
 progressive exertional dyspnea, recent noncompliant with furosemide, assess
 for cardiopulmonary architecture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with several preceding chest examinations dated
 ___, ___ and ___.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement.  There is no typical configurational abnormality, however,
 beginning double contour on the frontal view and straightened left cardiac
 border suggestive of some mild enlargement of the left atrium supported by the
 mild deviation of the descending aorta to the left at that level.  The
 pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and
 there is some increased perivascular haze on the bases.  Although there is no
 clear evidence of fluid in the pleural spaces, the lateral view discloses some
 mild blunting of the posterior dependent portions of the pleural space.  There
 is no evidence of any acute pulmonary infiltrate such as were diagnosed on the
 latest preceding chest examination ___ ___, to exist in the mid left
 lung field.  In comparison, it is extended to examinations ___ and ___. 
 Comparison with today's study demonstrates a mildly increased upper zone
 redistribution, coinciding with some increased interstitial elements and
 subtle changes of pleural effusion in the posterior pleural space.  These
 findings are in support of the clinically suggested diagnosis that the patient
 had significant interval weight gain, probably related to noncompliance with
 Lasix medication.  Thus, there is no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates,
 but comparison suggests mild degree of chronic CHF.  A followup examination in
 two to three weeks could confirm suggested diagnosis, if the subtle vascular
 changes return to normal.
