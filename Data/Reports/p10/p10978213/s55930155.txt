                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pacemaker upgrade.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extraction and replacement of the right ventricular lead was done. A new lead
 goes to the coronary sinus, ending in one of the cardiac vein over the left
 ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax. Minimal pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening is seen on the lateral view at both costodiaphragmatic angles. 
 Air-fluid level is seen adjacent to the pacemaker in the soft tissue, probably
 due to recent manipulation.  Except for minimal left lower lung atelectasis,
 the remaining of the lungs is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Adequate positioning of new pacemaker leads.
 
 2.  There is no pneumothorax.
