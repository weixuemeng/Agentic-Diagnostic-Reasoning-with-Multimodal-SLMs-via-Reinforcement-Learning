                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with
 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac
 silhouette is markedly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 While there is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, no pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, though an
 underlying effusion cannot be excluded, nor can infection be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac
 opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection, and a left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.
