                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided pleural effusion after thoracentesis, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 substantial decrease in the degree of right pleural effusion, though some
 fluid in the pleural space remains.  Specifically, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The remainder of the study is unchanged from the previous
 examination.
