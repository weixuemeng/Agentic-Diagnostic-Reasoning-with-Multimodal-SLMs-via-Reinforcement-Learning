                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, rales, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Multiple leads and lines overlie the chest.  
 
 There is a small left effusion with some associated left base atelectasis. 
 Possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate in this location cannot be
 excluded.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 minimal atelectasis at the right base.  There are prominent interstitial
 markings in both lungs, with pleural scarring at the left lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interstitial markings in both lungs, likely reflecting CHF.
 
 2.  Left effusion with left base atelectasis.  An early infiltrate in this
 area cannot be excluded.
