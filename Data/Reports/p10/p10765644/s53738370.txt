                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CHF and primary effusion lymphoma
 with new right pleural effusion, status post drainage in-house on ___. 
 Evaluate for reaccumulation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable single view
 chest examination of ___.  Previously described marked cardiac
 enlargement, permanent pacer with ICD line, and atrial electrode as well as a
 right-sided electrode, probably abandoned, remain unchanged.  The on previous
 examination still present right pleural tube with typical pigtail end has been
 removed.  The at that time existing small basal loculated pneumothorax at the
 catheter entrance has now filled in with some pleural effusion.  The amount is
 small and does not compromise significantly the pulmonary volume.  The right
 lung remains well aerated.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates
 or significant pulmonary congestion.  On the lateral view which was included
 in today's examination, one can only identify very small pleural effusions
 blunting the ultimate sinuses posteriorly.  This view also illustrates well
 the rather demineralized vertebral column of the thoracic spine with
 accentuated kyphosis and multiple moderately depressed vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, marked cardiomegaly but absence of acute
 pulmonary congestion or edema.  The amount of bilateral pleural effusions is
 rather small.  No pneumothorax residual is present.
