                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, status post trach, choking episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a midline tracheostomy tube. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  In the
 right infrahilar region, there is a 2.3 x 2.3 cm rounded opacity which while
 could relate to vascular structures, an underlying nodule is not excluded, and
 further evaluation is recommended with chest CT.  No focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  2.3 x 2.3 cm rounded opacity in the right infrahilar region
 conceivably could be vascular; however, is quite round and raises concern for
 underlying pulmonary nodule.  This may have been obscured on the prior study. 
 Suggest oblique views or chest CT for further evaluation.  The remainder of
 the lungs show no focal consolidation.
