                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain status post fall.  Question
 acute process or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate top normal heart
 size, unchanged.  There is unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The lungs are clear, with the
 exption of ill defined opacity in the right middle lobe, which appears long
 standing.  There is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 Current exam is not tailored to assess for rib fractures; however, there is a
 minimally displaced fracture of the lateral right ninth rib.  Slight wedge
 deformity along the anterior aspect of T12 vertebral body is unchanged since
 at least ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimally displaced lateral right ninth rib fracture.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable T12 compression.
 3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 4.  Consider repeat PA/Lateral radiographs once rib fracture heals to ensure
 re-expansion of the right middle lobe.
