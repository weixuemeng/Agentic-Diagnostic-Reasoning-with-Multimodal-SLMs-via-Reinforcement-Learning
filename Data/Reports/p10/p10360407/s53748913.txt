                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ years of cough.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with subsequent increase in
 density at the lower aspect of the right hilus, likely reflecting local
 atelectasis.  The aorta continues to be tortuous.  There is minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small pleural scar. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No acute lung parenchymal changes.
 No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
