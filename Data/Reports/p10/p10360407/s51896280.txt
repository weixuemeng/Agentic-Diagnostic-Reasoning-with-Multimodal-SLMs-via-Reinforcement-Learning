                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with emphysema and productive cough
 for one week with abnormal right lower lobe lung examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged, and no typical configurational
 abnormality is seen.  Unchanged appearance of the thoracic aorta which is
 moderately widened and elongated.  No local contour abnormalities are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of new
 acute parenchymal infiltrates can be found.  As before, the right-sided
 hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated and the lateral pleural sinus blunted
 indicative of old pleural scar formation.  Note also that the patient had
 experienced a minimally displaced rib fracture of the ninth rib on the right
 side laterally related to a fall.  This fracture cannot be seen anymore, but
 suggests that the mild elevation of the diaphragm and the pleural scar may
 relate to this incident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of acute CHF or infiltrates. 
 Stable scar formations.  No new skeletal abnormalities.
