 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation of left hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:53 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased
 transparency of the left hemithorax, likely reflecting improved ventilation. 
 The position of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been adjusted, the tip of the
 catheter is now at the outflow tract of the right ventricle.  The other
 monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  Slight decrease in size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No larger pleural effusions.
