                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M Afib (on Coumadin), CAD (s/p CABG x2), DM, prostate CA (s/p
 XRT), chronic back pain, s/p elective anterior lateral L1-L2 fusion (on
 ___, required debridement of ?phlegmon) with post-operative course
 complicated by RP bleed and delirium.  Now with cough and concern for
 aspiration  // evaluate for infiltrate   evaluate for infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ through
 ___.
 
 Multi focal  heterogeneous opacification in both lungs has developed since ___ when consolidation was restricted to the left lower lobe.  Although this
 could be asymmetric distribution of mild pulmonary edema which is probably
 present,, the relatively discrete nature of new more consolidative looking
 opacities in the right upper lobe and right lower lung suggest concurrent
 multifocal pneumonia, alternatively but less likely, pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 Heart is top-normal size, unchanged.  Pleural effusion is small, on the left
 if any.  No pneumothorax is present.
