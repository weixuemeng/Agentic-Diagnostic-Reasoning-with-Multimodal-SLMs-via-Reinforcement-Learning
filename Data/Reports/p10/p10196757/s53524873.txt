                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post redo sternotomy and CABG with sternal
 clicking.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Sternal wires are aligned and
 unchanged in position and appearance.  Bibasilar opacities are likely
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  Surgical clips
 project in the right axilla, and right upper hemithorax.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.  Evaluation of the sternum is
 limited, but the appearance in the lateral view is unchanged.
