 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, leukocytosis  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart appears enlarged, which may be exaggerated
 due to low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits. Bibasilar opacities are likely related to small pleural
 effusions and atelectasis however, in the appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely related to small pleural effusions and atelectasis
 however superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
