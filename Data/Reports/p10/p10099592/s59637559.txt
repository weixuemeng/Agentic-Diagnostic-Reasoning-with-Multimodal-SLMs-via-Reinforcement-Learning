                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain with possible widened mediastinum on portable
 radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day as well as chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal
 and previously visualized apparent bulging of the right upper outer
 mediastinum is no longer seen, consistent with artifact.  A nodule is again
 noted in the right upper lung.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild dextroscoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine with moderate degenerative changes appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process with resolution of artifact at
 the right upper outer mediastinum.
