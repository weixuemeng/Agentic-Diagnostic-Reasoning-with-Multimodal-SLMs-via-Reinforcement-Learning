                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart is mildly enlarged and the
 lung vasculature mildly engorged.  Rightward rotation exaggerates the contour
 of the ascending thoracic aorta which is nevertheless very tortuous or
 conceivably dilated.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or
 pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Possible early cardiac decompensation; no edema or pneumonia.
 2.  Tortuous or, less likely, dilated ascending thoracic aorta
