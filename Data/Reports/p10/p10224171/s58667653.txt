                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG x3.  Chest tube placed to waterseal.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged with the tip in the
 mid SVC.  Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains are unchanged.
 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  A right basilar consolidation is similar to
 the prior exam.  There is no overt pulmonary edema, though there are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has an expected
 postoperative appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged right basilar opacity, which is nonspecific and may be
 atelectasis.  In the proper clinical setting, infection or aspiration is a
 consideration.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
