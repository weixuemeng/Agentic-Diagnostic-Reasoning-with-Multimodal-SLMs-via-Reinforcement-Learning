                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of lung cancer resection who presents
 shortness of breath and chest pain  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and right lower lobectomy.  Heart
 size is top normal. Aortic knob calcifications are re- demonstrated.
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Compared to the prior chest radiograph,
 the degree of diffuse right lung opacification has improved, with improved
 aeration particularly in the right upper lung field.  Emphysematous changes
 are again seen within the right apex.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion. Patchy opacities within the medial aspect of the left lung base are
 unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the right lung compared to the prior
 study, but there is persistent hazy opacification within the right lung base
 concerning for persistent pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is present. 
 Continued patchy opacity in the medial aspect of the left lung base, also
 concerning for additional site of infection.
