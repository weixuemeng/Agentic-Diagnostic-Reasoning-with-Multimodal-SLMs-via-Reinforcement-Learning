                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions appear similar. 
 Very small loculated right apical hydropneumothorax is similar to the prior
 radiograph.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Multifocal consolidations
 in the right mid and both lower lungs show interval improvement in the left
 lower lobe.  Otherwise, no relevant short interval change.
