 AP CHEST, 9:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure after intubation.  Check line positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 1:24 a.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.  Dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous
 catheter ends in the low SVC and at the superior cavoatrial junction, left
 internal jugular line has been pulled back to the junction of brachiocephalic
 veins.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 and severe cardiomegaly persists.  Heterogeneous quality of the lungs raises
 the possibility of pneumonia though some of the abnormality could be due to
 emphysema or even dilated vessels contrasting with aerated lung.  No
 pneumothorax.
