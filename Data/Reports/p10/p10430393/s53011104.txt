                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with T9 rib fx with hemothorax, evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A small to moderate right pleural effusion has increased compared with the
 prior study.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Markedly enlarged
 and tortuous aorta is similar to recent prior studies.  Severe right
 acromioclavicular degenerative changes and glenohumeral degenerative changes
 are noted.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Unchanged
 small left pleural effusion.
 2. Markedly dilated and tortuous thoracic aorta, more fully evaluated by
 recent CT chest.
