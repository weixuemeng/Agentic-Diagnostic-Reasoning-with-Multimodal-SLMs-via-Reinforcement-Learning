 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal and there are
 areas of atelectasis both at the right and the left lung bases, more severe on
 the left. However, the appearance of the lung parenchyma at the lung bases is
 otherwise unremarkable, there are no typically radiographically signs
 suggesting aspiration.  Moderate elongation of the descending aorta.  No
 pneumothorax.  Healed right-sided rib fractures. Part of a right mandibular
 fixation device is visualized.
