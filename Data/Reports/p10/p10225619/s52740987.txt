                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with runs of ventricular tachycardia, now
 requiring assessment of the position of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal chest radiographs demonstrate a right IJ Swan-Ganz
 catheter with the tip located in the main pulmonary artery, unchanged from
 previous imaging.  An NG tube is seen passing to the stomach and out of view. 
 ET tube is visualized with the tip 8 cm above the carina.  The ET tube needs
 to be advanced 1 cm.  Left IJ is visualized with the tip in the low SVC. 
 Diffuse lung opacities are again seen with slight improvement on the right and
 no change on the left.  Opacities could be consistent with pulmonary edema,
 pneumonia, or both.  The cardiac size is top-normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the main pulmonary artery. 
 Slightly improved diffuse lung opacities on the right with no change on the
 left.  ET tube needs to be advanced 1 cm.
