 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p aorto-bifemoral bypass c/b aortoenteric fistula s/p aorto
 uni-iliac stent graft, L iliac plug, and fem-fem bypass PTFE ___ s/p graft
 debridement and SBR .  Desats and SOB  // eval for interval change    eval for

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung
 volumes.  Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural
 effusion and volume loss in the lower lobe.  The right hemidiaphragm remains
 sharply seen.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be extremely difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
