                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status, vomiting.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior studies, a right-sided Port a cath with tip terminating
 in at the cavoatrial junction is new.  Lung volumes are lower, causing a
 component of bronchovascular crowding.  The left heart border is silhouetted,
 with a suspected left basilar opacity.  Interstitial lung markings are more
 prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Silhouette sign of the left heart border and left basilar opacity may be due
 to aspiration, given the clinical setting.
