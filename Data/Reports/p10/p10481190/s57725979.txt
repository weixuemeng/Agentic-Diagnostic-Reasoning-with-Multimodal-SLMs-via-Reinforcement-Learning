 As compared to the previous radiograph, the air collection in the right-sided
 chest wall has completely resolved. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  A
 paramediastinal right-sided abnormal contour is unchanged in extent and
 density as compared to the previous examination. The abnormality could be
 postoperative in origin and should be monitored what radiographically. A
 minimal right-sided pleural effusion persists and is visible on the lateral
 radiograph only. Otherwise, the right lung has returned to normal volume. No
 cardiomegaly. Mild tortuosity of the descending aorta.
