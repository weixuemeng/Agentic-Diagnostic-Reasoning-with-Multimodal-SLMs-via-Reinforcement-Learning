                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // evidence of fluid or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful to
 detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded, but clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. A 1.5 x 0.7 cm hyperdensity
 projecting over the anterior right second rib on the frontal view is
 incidentally noted, and not visualized on the lateral view.LAD stent is in
 place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight hyperexpansion, otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary pathology. 
 Hyperdensity projecting over the anterior right second rib on the frontal view
 is likely musculoskeletal in origin, but followup radiographs can be performed
 in 3 months to ensure stability unless more remote studies become available
 for direct comparison.
