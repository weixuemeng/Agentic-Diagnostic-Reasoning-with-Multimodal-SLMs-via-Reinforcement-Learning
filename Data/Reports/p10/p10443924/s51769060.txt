 INDICATION:  ___M with fever abdominal pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and abdominal CT from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for changes due to low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal

 and aortic arch calcifications.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  There
 are bibasilar opacities, more conspicuous on the right than on the left. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right greater than left basilar opacities, on the right compatible with trace
 effusion and consolidation, potentially infection, as seen on recent CT.  Left
 base likely atelectasis.
