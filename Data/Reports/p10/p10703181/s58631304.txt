                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leg swelling, chills, concern for possible DVT versus cellulitis.
 Also with increased lactate.  Please evaluate for other possible infectious
 sources.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CTA chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Limited evaluation of PA and lateral radiograph due to body habitus
 and arm positioning.  Streaky opacification in left lower lung likely reflects
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.  Cardiac, hilar, and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute intrathoracic process.
