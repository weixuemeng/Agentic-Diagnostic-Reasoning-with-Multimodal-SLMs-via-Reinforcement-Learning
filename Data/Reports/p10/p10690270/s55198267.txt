                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough for months, never smoker, history of PPD. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Of note is a relatively
 dense right hilus without pathologic contours.  On the left, the hilar area
 appears normal.  No evidence of mediastinal abnormalities.  The finding should
 be compared to previous radiographs, if unavailable, CT should be considered
 to evaluate potential hilar pathology.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Mild
 degenerative spine disease.
