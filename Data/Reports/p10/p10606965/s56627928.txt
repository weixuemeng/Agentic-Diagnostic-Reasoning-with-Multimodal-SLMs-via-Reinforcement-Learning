                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the region of
 the right atrium and right ventricle as well as an abandoned lead within the
 left anterior chest wall. The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG,
 and mitral valve replacement. Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance. The aorta is markedly tortuous. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic with linear opacities in both lung bases
 compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis. There appears to be minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angle posteriorly on the left suggestive of the
 trace left pleural effusion. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 visualized. There is gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel. No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with trace left pleural effusion. Chronic elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with gaseous distension of the colon.
