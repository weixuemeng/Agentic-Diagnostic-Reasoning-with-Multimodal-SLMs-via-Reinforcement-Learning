 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been interval development of a right basilar
 opacity. Retrocardiac opacity is somewhat improved although there is a
 probable small residual left pleural effusion. Superiorly the lungs are clear.
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Mitral valve replacements and
 left chest wall pacing device are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity potentially atelectasis noting that infection is not
 excluded. Otherwise no significant interval change of probable residual left
 pleural effusion.
