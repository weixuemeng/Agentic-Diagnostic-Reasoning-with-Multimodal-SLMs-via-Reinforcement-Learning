                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scoliosis series of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest are provided.  A severe kyphosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is noted, which slightly limits evaluation.  Lung volumes
 are low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  Possible very mild
 perihilar vascular congestion is present.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  Partially
 preserved imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited evaluation due to severe thoracolumbar spine kyphosis.  Low lung
 volumes.  Possible very mild perihilar vascular congestion.  No large
 consolidation or pleural effusion.
