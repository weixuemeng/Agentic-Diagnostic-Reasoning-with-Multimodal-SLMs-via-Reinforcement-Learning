 INDICATION:  History: ___M with RUQ pain.  // Assess for consolidation or R rib
 injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral

 There relatively low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation is seen. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is identified.
