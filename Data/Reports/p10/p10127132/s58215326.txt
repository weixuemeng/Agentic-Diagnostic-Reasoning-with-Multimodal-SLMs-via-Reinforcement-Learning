                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base.  In addition,
 indistinctness of the right heart border may be due to infection versus
 atelectasis.  A better evaluation would be provided on a chest CT, which has
 already been ordered.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid-to-low
 SVC.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carina.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  Possible right middle lobe
 pneumonia.  This will be better evaluated on patient's upcoming chest CT.
