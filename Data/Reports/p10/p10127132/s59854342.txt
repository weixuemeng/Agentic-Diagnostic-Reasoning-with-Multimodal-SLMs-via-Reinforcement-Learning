                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with lymph node enlargement worrisome for
 lymphoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs.  Prominence of interstitial markings could
 reflect chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
 
 If there is any serious clinical concern for mediastinal or hilar adenopathy,
 CT would be the next imaging procedure.
