                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, which may be due
 to chronic lung disease, no priors available for comparison.  Atypical
 infection, thus, is not entirely excluded.  No lobar consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is minor right apical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, which
 may be due to chronic lung disease.  However, given lack of priors for
 comparison to assess for chronicity, an atypical infection is not excluded.
