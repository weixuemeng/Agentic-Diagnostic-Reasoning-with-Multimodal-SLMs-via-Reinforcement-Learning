                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sharp right chest pain with cough or sneeze. 
 Evaluate for fracture, acute process to cause pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest and left rib radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette is likely exaggerated by low lung
 volumes on the PA view.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The ribs are not well penetrated on chest radiography for
 better visualization of the lungs, and the inferior ribs are not fully imaged.
 No obvious rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for active cardiopulmonary disease.  If clinically warranted, the
 right ribs could be better assessed by dedicated rib radiographs.
