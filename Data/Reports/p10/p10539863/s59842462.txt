                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p ACDF with neck hematoma  // Eval for pna
 and interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Significant interval improvement, with marked decrease in the bilateral
 airspace opacities predominantly in the upper lobes.  There is persistent
 dense left retrocardiac opacity.  No pneumothorax.  No significant pleural
 effusions.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval improvement in the bilateral airspace opacities.  Given
 the rapid improvement in the airspace opacities, noncardiogenic pulmonary
 edema is favored over diffuse pneumonia.
