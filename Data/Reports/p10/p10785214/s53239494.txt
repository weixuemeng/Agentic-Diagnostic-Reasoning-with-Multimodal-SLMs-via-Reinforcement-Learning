                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including borderline cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration as
 well as moderate tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta and aortic
 calcification.  A moderate-sized eventration is noted along the anterior right
 hemidiaphragm.  Streaky associated opacities at the right lung base have
 increased somewhat, but most suggestive of atelectasis associated with the
 eventration.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A vague
 calcified nodular density measuring about 15 mm, projecting both over the left
 mid lung and course of the left posterior lateral seventh rib, appears
 unchanged; given lack of change, presumably this is a benign finding.  There
 is mild rightward convex curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine. 
 Mild degenerative changes involvement through lower thoracic levels.  The
 bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right basilar opacities, probably due to atelectasis,
 associated with an eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. Stable nodular
 focus projecting over the left mid lung.
