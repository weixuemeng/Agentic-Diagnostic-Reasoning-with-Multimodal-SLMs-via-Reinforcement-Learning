                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes elevation of the right hemidiaphragm persist.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity
 is most likely due to atelectasis in appears similar to prior studies,
 however, the poor but clinical setting, difficult to entirely exclude
 infectious process.  No pneumothorax seen.  The lateral view is suboptimal due
 to underpenetration.  No large pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 Morgani hernia.  Patchy left base opacity most likely due to atelectasis
 although in the appropriate clinical setting infection is not excluded.
