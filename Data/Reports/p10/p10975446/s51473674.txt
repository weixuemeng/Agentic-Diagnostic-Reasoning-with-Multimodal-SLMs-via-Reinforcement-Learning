 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Question worsening congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a similar mild
 interstitial abnormality with prominence of central pulmonary vascularity,
 suggesting mild vascular congestion.  In addition, patchy streaky opacities in
 the right mid and lower lung suggest a background of minor scarring or
 atelectasis.  Although evaluation is limited, there is no definite pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated, although it is noted that the left
 lung apex is obscured by a flexed chin.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially stable findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
