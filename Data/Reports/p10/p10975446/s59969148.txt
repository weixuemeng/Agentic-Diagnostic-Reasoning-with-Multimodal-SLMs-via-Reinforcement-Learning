                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two AP semi-erect portable views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a somewhat heterogeneous but generally diffuse mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.  One of two
 views shows a slightly more confluent right upper lobe opacity of uncertain
 significance, quite vague, and there is also focal left infrahilar opacity.
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  More focal patchy
 right upper lobe and left infrahilar opacities of uncertain significance but
 possibly due to coinciding atelectasis or scarring.  If developing infection
 is a clinical consideration then short-term followup radiographs could be
 considered.
