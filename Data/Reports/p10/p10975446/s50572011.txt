                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  Patchy opacities persist at
 the bases, and likely reflect atelectasis.  Followup radiographs may be
 helpful to exclude pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
