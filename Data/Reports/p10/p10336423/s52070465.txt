                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again opacification
 at the right base seen posteriorly on the lateral view.  This is consistent
 with lower lobe pneumonia and probable small pleural effusions.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
