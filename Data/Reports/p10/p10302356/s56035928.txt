                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent right hip fracture.  Patient
 with delirium, now with fever and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is a large hiatal hernia which is now filled mostly with fluid.  This
 limits evaluation.  There has been development of bilateral pleural effusions
 since the previous study.  Some coarsening of the bronchovascular markings. 
 Atelectasis or consolidation to left retrocardiac area cannot be excluded due
 to the hiatal hernia.  There is some generalized demineralization.
