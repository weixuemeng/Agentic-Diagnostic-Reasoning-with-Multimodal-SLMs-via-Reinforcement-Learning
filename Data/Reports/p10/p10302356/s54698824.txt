                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, weakness  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evidence of a large diaphragmatic, hiatal hernia is again seen with
 intrathoracic stomach and loops of bowel. There is slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle and there may be trace pleural effusion. Retrocardiac
 opacity likely relates to large hiatal hernia with associated atelectasis.
 Underlying consolidation is not excluded although felt less likely. Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Diffuse osteopenia.
