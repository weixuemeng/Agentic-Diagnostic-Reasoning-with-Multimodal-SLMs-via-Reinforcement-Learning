                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Series of chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright radiograph provided.  There are bibasilar
 heterogeneous linear opacities, similar in appearance and extent to the prior
 studies and consistent with atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  There is a tracheostomy tube and collar in place.  There is a
 markedly distended gastric bubble with a distended loop of colon overlying the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis without evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Gaseous gastric and colonic dilation, incompletely imaged.  Abdominal
 radiograph may be obtained if clinically appropriate
