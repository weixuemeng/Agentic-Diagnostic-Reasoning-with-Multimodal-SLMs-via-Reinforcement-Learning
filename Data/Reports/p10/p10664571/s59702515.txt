                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are very low likely due to severe abdominal distention
 from dilated large bowel.  There are bibasilar opacities, which likely
 represents atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  The patient
 has tracheostomy in appropriate position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 large pleural effusion identified.  Please see dedicated abdominal films for
 better characterization of the abdominal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Very low lung volumes, likely given distention of abdomen.  This is
 causing bibasilar atelectasis, however, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
 ruled out given the basilar opacities.  No free air identified.
