                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and chest pain and rales in the left
 axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces.  Mild pectus
 deformity noted.  Right nipple should not be mistaken for a lung nodule.
 
 Suggestion of leftward displacement of the trachea above the clavicles
 warrants physical evaluation for possible enlargement of the right lobe of the
 thyroid gland.
