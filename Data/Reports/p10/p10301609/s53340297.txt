                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement for patient with metastatic colon cancer and
 esophageal obstruction.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that is within the fundus of the stomach just beneath the
 left hemidiaphragm.  Extensive opacification persists at the left base, most
 likely consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia must be considered.
