                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that is coiled within the fundus of the stomach.  There is
 increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  This
 raises the possibility of developing pneumonia or substantial atelectatic
 change in the lower lobe.  The tip of the Port-A-Cath is difficult to see.  It
 probably is within the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
