 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, obstruction, history of chest pain,
 evaluation for nasogastric tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the
 nasogastric tube is unchanged.  The tip projects over the proximal parts of
 the stomach.
 
 Newly appeared are bilateral basal parenchymal opacities that are symmetrical.
 Given the short-time interval since the normal previous radiograph, the most
 likely explanation for these opacities are atelectatic changes.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
