 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain with history of multiple surgeries.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Right-sided Port-A-Cath
 tip terminates in the lower SVC.   No free air is noted on the hemidiaphragms.
 However, prominent loops of small bowel are noted in the left upper quadrant
 and raise suspicion for obstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No free air is noted under the hemidiaphragms.  However, dilated loops of
 small bowel is noted in the upper quadrant and raise suspicion for possible
 obstruction.  Please correlate clinically and with an abdominal CT if further
 characterization is necessary.
