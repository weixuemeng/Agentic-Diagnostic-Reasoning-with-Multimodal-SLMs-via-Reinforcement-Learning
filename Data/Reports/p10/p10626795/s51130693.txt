  8 mm perihilar density is present on the left.  This most likely is a vessel,
  but a small nodule cannot be excluded.  Would recommend follow up with a
  non-emergent CT of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  An 8 mm round density is present in the left perihilar region, most
 likely a vessel, but a small pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without consolidations or edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Small left perihilar density is present and most likely represents a
 vessel, although a small pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Finding will be
 further evaluated on pending chest CTA.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
