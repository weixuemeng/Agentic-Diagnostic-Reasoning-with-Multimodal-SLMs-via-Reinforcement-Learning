                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man with shortness of breath, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable single view chest x-ray in upright position shows
 reduced lung volume with new bilateral widespread opacification and interval
 increase of the vascular pedicle, compatible with new moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Heart size is still moderately enlarged in a patient who has had
 median sternotomy for cardiac surgery.  Bibasilar opacities, denser in the
 left lung base are probably due to the bibasilar pleural effusion, larger to
 the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate pulmonary edema with central vein distention,
 moderate cardiomegaly and bibasilar pleural effusion, larger to the left.
