 HISTORY:  Status post CABG and reintubated.  Evaluate for collapse or
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates multiple sternotomy, a
 nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube, and left PICC, all of which are unchanged
 in position.  The exam is not significantly changed from prior chest
 radiograph, and redemonstrates mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well
 as bibasilar atelectasis and a small to moderate left pleural effusion.  Right
 base atelectasis may be slightly improved.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible minimal improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise
 unchanged chest radiograph.
