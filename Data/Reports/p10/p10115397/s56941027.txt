 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:24 PM
  Lung volumes are very low with bibasilar atelectasis.  The ET tube is
  approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube and right internal
  jugular central venous catheter are in stable position.  A new left subclavian
  transvenous pacer terminates in the right ventricle.  Numerous epicardial
  pacing leads are faintly visible projecting over the heart. There is no
  pneumothorax or evidence of other post-procedural complication.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:38 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  This is an ___-year-old man after AVR and CABG with a new pacing
 wire.  Assess lines and tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New left subclavian pacer lead passes along the expected path to the floor of
 the right ventricle.  ET tube, right internal jugular line, left pleural and
 midline drains are in standard placements.  An upper enteric drainage tube
 ends in the stomach.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Worsened slightly since ___ is a combination of consolidation at the
 right lung base and ground-glass opacification more superiorly in the right
 lung.  These findings preceded surgery.  Peripheral consolidation in the left
 lung worsened appreciably after surgery some time between ___ and
 ___.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative
 appearance, comparable to the preoperative ___.  No pneumothorax.
