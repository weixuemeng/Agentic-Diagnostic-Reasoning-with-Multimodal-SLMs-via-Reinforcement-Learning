                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is dense right basilar
 opacity compatible with pneumonia.  Less significant retrocardiac opacity and
 left mid lung opacity seen as well, potential additional sites of
 consolidation.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  There is no definite
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but likely accentuated due
 to relatively low lung volumes, particularly on the frontal view.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle and lower lobe opacities compatible with infection
 in the proper clinical setting.  Smaller region of consolidation in the left
 lung laterally.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution, to
 exclude underlying lesion.
