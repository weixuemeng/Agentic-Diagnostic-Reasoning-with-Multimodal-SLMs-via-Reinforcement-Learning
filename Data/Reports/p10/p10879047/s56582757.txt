                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged including tortuosity and calcification of
 the aorta.  The pulmonary arteries are prominent including upper zone
 redistribution and an indistinct character which suggests mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis.  There is a non-displaced right posterolateral fractures
 involving the seventh and eighth ribs of uncertain acuity but not necessarily
 recent.  In fact, the eighth appears to show some remodeling on the prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Non-displaced right-sided rib fractures although not necessarily acute.
