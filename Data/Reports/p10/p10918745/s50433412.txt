                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stroke, non-responsive, NG tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 20:13.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 10:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of a right internal jugular central line.  Interval
 placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip within the stomach, although
 the side port is near but just below the gastroesophageal junction.  It would
 be prudent to advance the tube somewhat to minimize the risk of aspiration. 
 The right lung is grossly clear.  There continues to be patchy opacity at the
 left base which does not appear to be significantly changed since ___ may
 reflect an area of atelectasis, aspiration, early pneumonia or possibly
 asymmetric edema given the fact that there is pulmonary venous hypertension
 and a suggestion of mild interstitial edema.  Correlation is advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcifications in the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  No pneumothorax.
