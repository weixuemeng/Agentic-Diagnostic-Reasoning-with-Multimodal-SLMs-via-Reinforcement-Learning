                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CVA, acute fulminant hepatitis, decreasing
 responsiveness, now with tachypnea.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___ at 15:42 p.m.:
 
 A right IJ central line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for differences in positioning,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably not changed.  There is left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  No CHF.  No gross effusion, though small effusions would be difficult
 to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt CHF.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No
 gross effusion.
