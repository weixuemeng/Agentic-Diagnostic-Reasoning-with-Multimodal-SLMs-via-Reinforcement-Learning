                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest tube, hemothorax.  Please evaluate and chest
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate cardiomegaly with
 mild central vessel congestion.  Right lower lung opacification likely
 represents a combination of elevated hemidiaphragm, atelectasis and reported
 hemothorax.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect small
 pleural effusion versus scarring.  No pneumothorax identified, though there is
 subcutaneous gas within the right chest wall surrounding a right chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung opacification, likely combination of elevated
 right hemidiaphragm, atelectasis, and reported hemothorax.  No pneumothorax. 
 Possible small left pleural effusion.
