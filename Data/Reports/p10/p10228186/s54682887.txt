                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new leukocytosis.  Any opacity?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size appears to have decreased mildly in
 comparison with the next previous study of ___.  Appearance of
 thoracic aorta as well as findings indicative of old left-sided lobectomy with
 multiple surgical clips in the left hilar area, unchanged.  No new
 pneumothorax is identified.  Comparison also reveals that the previously
 present pulmonary vascular distension with perivascular haze has regressed
 markedly and appears quite normal presently.  This indicates that the
 previously encountered pulmonary congestion of ___ was temporary and
 the chest appearance has returned to a finding similar as encountered on an
 older examination of ___.  Whether this improvement relates to
 successful dehydration or the successful cardio-conversion may be questioned. 
 On the present examination, there is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary
 infiltrates that might be the cause of the  new leukocytosis in this patient
 with lower extremity ulcers.
