                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman ventilated for shock of unknown etiology with
 pulmonary infiltrates.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left IJ line projects slightly more distal, near the cavoatrial junction.
 Lines and tubes are otherwise grossly unchanged.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen are extensive patchy opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in
 the right upper and mid zones but also seen at the right and left bases and
 left perihilar region.  The overall distribution is similar.  Changes in the
 right upper and suprahilar zones may be slightly less dense.  No gross
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.  Prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive multiple bilateral opacities, non-specific, but compatible with
 multifocal pneumonia.  These are overall similar to the study from 1 day
 earlier.  There has been possible minimal improvement in the right upper/
 suprahilar zones.
