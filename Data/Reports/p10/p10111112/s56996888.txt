                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 with enlargement of the hila bilaterally compatible with pulmonary arterial
 enlargement.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy right upper and
 lower lung field opacities appear improved compared to the prior study.  A
 moderate size left pleural effusion may be minimally increased from prior with
 continued left basilar opacification, likely compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper and lower lung field patchy opacities may reflect areas of
 infection, but appear improved compared to the previous radiograph.  Moderate
 left pleural effusion appears mildly increased from prior, with continued left
 basilar compressive atelectasis.
