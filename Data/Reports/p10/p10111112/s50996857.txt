 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation  // please evaluate for tube
 placement
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the chest x-ray from ___ at 05:12,  there has been
 increase in degree of confluent opacity in the right upper and mid/perihilar
 zones and in left perihilar region.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is also
 present behind the right an left cardiac silhouettes.  Minimal blunting of
 left costophrenic angle is again noted.  Mild vascular plethora is likely
 present.  The right costophrenic angle is clear.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Compared to the prior film, an ET tube is now in place, tip approximately 4.6
 cm above the carina, at the level of the upper clavicular heads.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening opacities in both lungs with prominent confluent opacity in the
 right upper and mid zones and left perihilar region as well as in the
 retrocardiac region.  The differential remains similar and includes asymmetric
 CHF related to or independent of mitral valve or papillary muscle
 abnormalities or edema with concurrent right upper lobe pneumonia.
 2. ET tube tip 4.6 cm above the carina, at the level of the upper clavicular
 heads.
