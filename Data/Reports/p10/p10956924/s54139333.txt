 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve
 replacement.  There is evidence of coronary artery stenting.  The heart size
 is mildly to moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is cephalization of
 the pulmonary vascular markings with mild engorgement, suggestive of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of
 the diaphragms possibly due to underlying COPD.  Small right pleural effusion
 is present.  There is adjacent compressive atelectasis in the right lung base.
 No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion.
