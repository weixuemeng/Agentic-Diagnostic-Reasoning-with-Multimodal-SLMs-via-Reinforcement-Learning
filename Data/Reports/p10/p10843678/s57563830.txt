                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female postop day #1 status post lap chole with
 shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic sulcus could reflect a small effusion.  The heart is normal in
 size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Free air seen under the right
 hemidiaphragm but is compatible with the patient's cholecystectomy from one
 day prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with free intraperitoneal air
 compatible with recent surgery.
