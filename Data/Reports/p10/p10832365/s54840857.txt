                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset AFib, assess for acute process in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained.  Several calcified
 pleural plaques project over the lungs.  There is no definite sign of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusion is seen, though the left CP angle is
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is within normal limits of
 size.  A retrocardiac density containing gas lucency is compatible with a
 hiatal hernia.  The aorta is somewhat unfolded with partially calcified aortic
 knob.  Bony structures appear intact with an old left mid clavicular shaft
 deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION: No signs of CHF or pneumonia.  Hiatal hernia noted.
