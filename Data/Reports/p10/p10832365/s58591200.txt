                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  COPD.  Patient with dyspnea and low-grade fever.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study, ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened consistent with COPD.  There
 is no evidence or pulmonary edema.  Increasing opacities in the right lower
 lobe are consistent with pneumonia.  Followup is recommended to assess
 resolution.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Several
 wedge-shaped compression fractures in mid thoracic vertebral bodies are
 present.  There appear to be bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
