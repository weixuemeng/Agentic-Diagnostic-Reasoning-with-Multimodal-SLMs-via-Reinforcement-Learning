                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left costophrenic angle is incompletely imaged on frontal view.
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild
 interstitial prominence is likely chronic, most commonly due to smoking or
 other respiratory irritant.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality, probably not related to the
 patient's acute chest pain.
