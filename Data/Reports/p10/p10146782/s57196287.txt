                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, COPD, dyspnea, productive cough, question
 infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is no lobar
 consolidation, though streaky perihilar opacities are slightly diminished in
 overall conspicuity compared with prior exam, which could represent
 improvement in acute airways inflammation.  No effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal perihilar streaky opacities which could represent
 residual mild airways inflammation.  Overall improvement from prior exam.
