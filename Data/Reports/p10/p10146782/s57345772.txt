                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, multiple intubations
 related to asthma.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 On the frontal exam, there is increased patchy opacity at the right lung base
 obscuring the right heart border which is less conspicuous on the lateral
 view.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear, costophrenic angles are sharp. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unchanged.  Changes at the right humeral head are less clearly
 seen on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the right middle lobe, more conspicuous on
 the frontal exam and potentially due to atelectasis; however, underlying
 pneumonia is not excluded.
