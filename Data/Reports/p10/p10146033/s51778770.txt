                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for AP technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  The lateral view is somewhat limited, particularly
 with respect to visualization of more anterior structures, because the arms
 are down.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
