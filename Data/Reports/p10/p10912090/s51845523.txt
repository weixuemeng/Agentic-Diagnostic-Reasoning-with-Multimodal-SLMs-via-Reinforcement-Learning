                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of HIV status post seizure or syncopal episode.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Within the left mid lung field medially, there is a new,
 approximately 2-cm focal opacity identified which is nonspecific but could
 reflect an area of infection.  The right lung is clear.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple clips
 in the right upper quadrant indicate prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New focal opacity in the left mid lung field, not seen on the prior studies. 
 This is nonspecific but could reflect an area of infection.  Follow
 radiographs are recommended after treatment to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
