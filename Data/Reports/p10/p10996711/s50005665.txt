 interval appearance of patchy opacity predominantly at the right base which
 may represent layering of fluid as there is also a linear opacity in the right
 mid lung which may represent fluid tracking within the horizontal fissure. 
 Pneumonia or atelectasis are also in the differential.  Followup imaging would
 be advised.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pulmonary venous
 hypertension.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
