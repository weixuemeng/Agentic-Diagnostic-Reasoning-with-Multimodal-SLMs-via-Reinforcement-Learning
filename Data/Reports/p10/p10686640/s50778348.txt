 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Diffuse veil-like opacity in the right hemithorax is consistent with
 a layering moderate-sized right pleural effusion.  Adjacent lung parenchymal
 opacities in the mid and lower lung regions may be due to atelectasis and/or
 infectious consolidation.  Note is also made of a questionable small left
 pleural effusion.
