                                 FINAL REPORT

 Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Two AP views of the chest demonstrate the process of insertion of the Dobbhoff
 tube which is currently terminating in the stomach.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged as well as bilateral basal consolidations and
 pleural effusion most likely present bilaterally, right most likely larger
 than left.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.
