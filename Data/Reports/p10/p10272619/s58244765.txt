                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal radiograph of the chest of the same date obtained
 approximately two hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interim from the prior examination, a nasogastric tube has
 been placed with tip in the stomach and side port still within the distal
 esophagus.  An endotracheal tube is in standard position.  The lungs appear
 grossly clear with mild basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal placement of endotracheal tube.  Esophageal catheter tip
 is within the stomach; however, side port in the distal esophagus.  This
 should be advanced at least 5 cm to ensure the side port is within the
 stomach.
