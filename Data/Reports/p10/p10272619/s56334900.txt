 INDICATION:  Productive cough and intermittent chest tightness.  Report of

 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiographs dated ___, and correlation with CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No new focal parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  A
 subtle opacity seen at the left base on the frontal radiograph has been
 present on prior examinations including the exam of ___ and ___.  Additionally, suggestion of opacity in the region of the inferior
 lingula is seen on the lateral radiograph, again unchanged.  In correlation
 with prior CT examination of ___, these findings could represent
 chronic atelectasis/pleural thickening.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No new focal parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Findings suggestive of chronic atelectasis and/or pleural thickening in
