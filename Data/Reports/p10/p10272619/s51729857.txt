                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with aspiration, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates increasing air space
 opacity in a right infrahilar location, which is compatible with given history
 of aspiration although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There
 has been interval extubation and NG tube removal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right infrahilar air space opacity which is compatible
 with given history of aspiration, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The
 interval increase in the extent of the opacity weights the differential
 diagnosis towards pneumonia rather than atelectasis.
