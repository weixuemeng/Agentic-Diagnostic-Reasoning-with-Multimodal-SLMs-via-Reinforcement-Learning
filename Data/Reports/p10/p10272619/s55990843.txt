                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent fever, COPD
 exacerbation despite doxycycline, ? pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal, and no
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Similar as on the preceding
 examination of ___, the diaphragms are somewhat low in position and
 slightly flattened, a finding which may indicate the presence of COPD.  Acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be seen.  The lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free, and no pneumothorax is present in the apical area on
 the frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  General chest findings compatible with some COPD but no evidence
 of acute infiltrates can be identified, and no cardiac enlargement or
 pulmonary congestion is seen.
