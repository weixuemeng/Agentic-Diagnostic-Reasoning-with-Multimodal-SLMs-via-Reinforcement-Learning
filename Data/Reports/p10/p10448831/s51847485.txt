                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New LV lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the various pacer leads.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 There are lower lung volumes, which accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Pulmonary vessels again are not well or sharply seen, consistent with
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
