                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Ultrasound recently with 6cm solid mass in the lower pole of the
 right kidney likely renal cell carcinoma.  // Please rule out pulmonary
 metastases
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. The lung
 volumes are normal. Bilateral apical thickening. Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Left pectoral
 pacemaker in unchanged position. There is no evidence of pulmonary metastasis,
 pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac of hyperlucency seen on
 the lateral radiograph only could represent small hiatal hernia.
