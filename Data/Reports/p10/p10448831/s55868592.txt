 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is similar to somewhat
 less striking, mild vascular congestion.  Streaky opacity at the left base
 suggests minor atelectasis associated with low lung volumes.

 Findings suggests mild vascular congestion, similar to slightly improved.
