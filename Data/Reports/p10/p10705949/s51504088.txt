                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with worsening shortness of breath,
 wheezing, and asthma/COPD exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Unremarkable appearance of the thoracic aorta and no abnormal
 mediastinal structures are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 There exists, however, a rather uneven peripheral vascular distribution in the
 pulmonary circulation with some increased linear densities on the bases and
 hyper-translucent appearance.  This coincides with rather low positioned and
 somewhat flattened diaphragmatic contours.  No evidence of any acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, and the pleural sinuses are free laterally and
 posteriorly.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly within normal
 limits.
 
 There exists no prior chest examination in our records available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  General findings compatible with rather advanced COPD, but no
 evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates can be identified.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
