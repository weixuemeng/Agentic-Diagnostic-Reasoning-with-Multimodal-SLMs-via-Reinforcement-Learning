                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Probable COPD exacerbation, though no improvement, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature
 compatible with emphysema.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest the
 presence of pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of congestive
 heart failure.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without superimposed pneumonia.
