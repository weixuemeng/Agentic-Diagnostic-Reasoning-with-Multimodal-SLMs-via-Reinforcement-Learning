                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and wheezing, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal hyperlucencies in the left upper lobe, potentially caused by
 mild pulmonary emphysema.  Two millimetric calcified granulomas in the left
 upper lobe.  The remaining lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  In particular,
 there is no evidence of pneumonia (not on the frontal nor on the lateral
 radiograph).  The spine sign is not applicable in this patient, given
 scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  Normal size of
 the cardiac silhouette.
