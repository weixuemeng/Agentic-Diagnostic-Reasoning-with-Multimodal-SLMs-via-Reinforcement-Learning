                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with leg swelling  // ?pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains at least mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Crowding
 of bronchovascular structures is present without pulmonary edema.  Elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are mild to moderate degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
