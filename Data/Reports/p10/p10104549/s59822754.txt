 HISTORY:  Report of a lung mass on outside hospital exam, rhonchi on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post right lower lobectomy with surgical sutures in the
 right hilar region.  Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Apart from minimal atelectasis
 in the right lung base, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  No mass lesion is clearly identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 No lung mass identified.  Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  Status post
 right lower lobectomy.  
 
 CT of the chest should be considered for further assessment given the history
 of a lung mass.
