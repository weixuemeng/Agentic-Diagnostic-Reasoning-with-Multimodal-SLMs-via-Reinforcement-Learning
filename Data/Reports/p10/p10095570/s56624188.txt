  1. The endotracheal tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea. A nasogastric
  tube terminates in the stomach. A left subclavian line terminates in the mid
  SVC.
  2. Multifocal pulmonary opacities, which could represent pulmonary edema
  versus multifocal pneumonia.
  3. Right upper lobe mass better evaluated on CT chest from the same day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation, resp failure  // ETT placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, endotracheal tube is in standard
 position, as well as a left subclavian vascular catheter and nasogastric tube.
 Abrupt widening of cardiomediastinal contours is likely due to a combination
 of increased volume status of the patient along with accentuation by lower
 lung volumes and supine technique.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by mild edema. Known right upper lobe mass and poorly defined left
 upper lobe lung nodules are seen to better detail on separately dictated CT of
 the chest from the same date.
