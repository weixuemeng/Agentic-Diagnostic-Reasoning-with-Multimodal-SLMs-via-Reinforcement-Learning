 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 persistent since the prior study, with overlying atelectasis.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No pulmonary edema is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.

 Low lung volumes with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and
 overlying atelectasis.  Given differences in lung volume, no definite change
 from the prior study.
