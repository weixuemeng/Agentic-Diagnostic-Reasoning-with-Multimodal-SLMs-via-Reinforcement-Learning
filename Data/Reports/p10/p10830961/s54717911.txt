                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of smoking with persistent cough and wheezing on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes accentuates the size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
 The heart size appears at least mildly enlarged.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 Assessment of the lung bases, particularly the left lung base, is limited due
 to the presence of low lung volumes and exclusion of the left costophrenic
 angle. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No right-sided
 pleural effusion is visualized.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis, though the left lung base is not completely
 imaged.  Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort
 when the patient is able to better assess the lung bases.
