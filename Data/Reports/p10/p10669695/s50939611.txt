                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been little change in the appearance of the
 chest since recent study, with persistent large left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left mid and lower lung
 region.  Slight worsening opacity in right lung base most likely represents a
 combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion, but superimposed
 aspiration or infection are possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
