                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left pleural effusion, increased since the prior
 study in ___ with subsequent shift of the mediastinum to the right. 
 There is resultant extensive atelectasis at the left lung base, and underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  There is likely also a small right pleural
 effusion, but aeration of the right lower lung is mostly improved.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary edema is also noted. The cardiac silhouette
 size cannot be assessed due to obscuration by the left pleural effusion.  
 Calcification in the aortic knob is again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pleural effusion, increased compared to prior, with
 presumed subsequent collapse of the left lower lobe and probably lingula. 
 Underlying consolidation is not excluded.
