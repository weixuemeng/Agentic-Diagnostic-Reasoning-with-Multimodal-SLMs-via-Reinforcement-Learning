                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left lower lobe collapse.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no significant change and decreased volume and left basal
 opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions are unchanged with subsegmental right basilar atelectasis.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 notable for enlargement of the aortic knob contour, consistent with known
 dissection. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and known large hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged left lower lobe collapse.
 2.  Abnormal aortic knob contour, consistent with patient's known aortic
 dissection is not enlarging.
