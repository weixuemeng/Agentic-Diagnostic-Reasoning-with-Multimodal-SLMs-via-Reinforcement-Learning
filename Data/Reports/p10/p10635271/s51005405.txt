 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic stenosis, chronic aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pleural
 effusions have bilaterally decreased in extent.  There is persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis, but no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  The effusions are better appreciated on the lateral than on the
 frontal radiograph.  Moderate valvular calcifications.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  Left pectoral pacemaker, the leads show normal course and
 position.
