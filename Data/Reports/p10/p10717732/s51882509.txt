 hemothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 20:11.

 Moderate residual multiloculated left pleural fluid collection is unchanged
 since the prior study.  Substantial atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 persists.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is also stable.  Right lung is
 grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  2 left pleural drains are in place,
 but I am not familiar with their appearance so I do not know if their
 positioning is standard.
 
 Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
