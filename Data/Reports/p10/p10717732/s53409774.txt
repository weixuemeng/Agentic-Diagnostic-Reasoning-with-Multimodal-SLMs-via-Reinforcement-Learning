                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with  leukocytosis s/p AVR.  Evaluate for
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right internal jugular venous catheter has now been removed.  Hazy opacity
 in the left lower lung with slight blurring of the left hemidiaphragm suggests
 moderate left dependent pleural effusion, and is slightly increased from the
 prior exam.  Mild pulmonary edema is probably overall unchanged when
 accounting for redistribution.  Lung volumes are low, unchanged.  Focal region
 of opacity in the right lower lung is more conspicuous on today's exam and
 concerning for pneumonia in the setting of leukocytosis.  Moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly persists and is probably overall unchanged.  The replaced aortic
 valve and median sternotomy wires appear intact and unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lung pneumonia and slightly increased moderate left pleural
 effusion.
