                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  History: ___F with generalized weakness  // r/o PNA      r/o
 PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is minimal streaky density at the right base and in the left upper lobe
 most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  In addition, there
 is increased density projected in the aortopulmonary window and lateral to the
 aortic knob on the frontal view that was not apparent previously.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.
 
 The left heart border is partially obscured by what appears to be epicardial
 fat.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified.  Mediastinal structures are
 otherwise unremarkable and appear stable.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.
 
 Increased density projected in the aortopulmonary window an adjacent left
 upper lobe on of the frontal view.  Further evaluation with oblique views or
 CT is recommended.
 
 Results discussed with Dr. ___ at 16 45.
