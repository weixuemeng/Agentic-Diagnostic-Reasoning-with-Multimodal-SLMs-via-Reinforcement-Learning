                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post ___ foot fall from horse, to assess
 for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT torso from an outside hospital and a chest
 radiograph done at an outside hospital earlier today.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is hypoaeration of the left lung, with a dense opacity in the
 retrocardiac left lung base, concerning for atelectasis versus lung contusion.
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen with overlying minimal chest
 wall/subcutaneous gas.  Known small left pneumothorax is not well visualized
 in the current study.  Small left pleural effusion is present.  The right lung
 is well expanded and clear.  A dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive left sided rib fractures, with a small left pleural
 effusion and left basal consolidation. Please see concurrent CT torso for
 further evaluation.
