                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the torso from
 ___.  Comparison is also made to radiographs of the chest from
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is some
 linear scarring and upward retraction of the bilateral hila, consistent with a
 history of lymphoma status post XRT.  This finding is unchanged since the
 prior radiographs.  Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and clear.  The
 cardiac size is normal.  There is no focal pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Note is made of a calcified lymph
 node in the right axilla, not significantly changed since ___. 
 Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the left upper quadrant and mid
 abdomen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
