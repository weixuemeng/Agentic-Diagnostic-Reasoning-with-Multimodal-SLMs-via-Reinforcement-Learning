                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral chest tubes.  // Evaluate for
 interval change, PTX etc.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC line terminates in lower SVC.  Bilateral chest tubes are in
 unchanged position.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Lung volume has decreased compared to prior.  Interval worsening of bilateral
 lower lobe opacification is partly due to atelectasis but the right side is
 concerning for pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural pole effusions have worsened. 
 The cardiac silhouette has increased slightly.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Worsening bilateral lower lobe opacification is partially due to worsening
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  However, the right side is worrisome for
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  No pneumothorax.
