                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML, dyspnea.  // ___ year old man with AML,
 dyspnea.      ___ year old man with AML, dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is increasing opacification at
 the left base consistent with pleural fluid an substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in this region.
 On the right, the hemidiaphragm now sharply seen with mild blunting of the
 costophrenic angle, consistent with decrease in the pleural effusion on this
 side.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no
 evidence of vascular congestion.  The tip of the Port-A-Cath again is in the
 right upper right atrium.
