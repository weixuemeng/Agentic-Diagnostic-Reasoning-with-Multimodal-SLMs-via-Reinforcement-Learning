                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of asthma and several weeks of
 shortness of breath with negative x-ray six weeks ago.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is left
 lower lobe collapse, causing mild leftward mediastinal shift.  In the setting
 of asthma one can assume initially that the cause is mucus plugging of central
 bronchi.  If this does not clear with treatment, inspection or imaging of the
 bronchial tree would be justfied.
 
 The lungs are otherwise clear and the heart is normal size.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse probably due to asthmatic mucus
 plugging. Suggest repeat chest radiograph after two weeks' treatment to
 document resolution.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ pager at
 11:00, five minutes after discovery was made and were subsequently discussed
 over the telephone.
