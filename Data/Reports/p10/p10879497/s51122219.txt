                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension  // eval for infection
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. Low lung volumes limits
 evaluation.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A small left Bochdalek's fat containing hernia is better
 assessed on prior CT though accounts for a small posterior opacity at the
 level of the left hemidiaphragm.  The heart is top-normal in size with an
 unfolded thoracic aorta again noted.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
