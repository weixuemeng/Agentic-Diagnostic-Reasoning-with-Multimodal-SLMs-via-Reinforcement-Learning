                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion and falls, on coumadin

 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size remains normal. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Lungs are grossly clear though assessment of the left
 apex is limited due to the patient's neck projecting over and obscuring this
 region. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Right shoulder arthroplasty is
 incompletely imaged. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
