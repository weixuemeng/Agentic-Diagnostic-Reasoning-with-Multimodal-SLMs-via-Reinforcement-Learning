                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Septic shock and worsening respiratory status, here to evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC and enteric tube are unchanged in position.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy.  An aortic valve prosthesis is in
 place.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Widening of the
 mediastinum is also grossly unchanged from ___.  There is no
 significant interval change in the extensive moderate-to-severe pulmonary
 edema. There is maturation of the right upper lobe consolidation from
 ___ with concern for developing cavitation.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is unchanged, likely reflecting a combination moderate left
 pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Maturation of right upper lobe consolidation with concern for cavitation.
 2.  No significant interval change in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
