                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ventral hernia status post wound VAC and IR-guided drain. 
 Evaluate PICC position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained quarterly.  The
 right PICC now ends at the origin of the SVC.  Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Right basilar
 atelectasis is very mild. Mild cardiac enlargement and the mediastinal
 silhouette are stable allowing for patient position and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC ends at the origin of the SVC.
