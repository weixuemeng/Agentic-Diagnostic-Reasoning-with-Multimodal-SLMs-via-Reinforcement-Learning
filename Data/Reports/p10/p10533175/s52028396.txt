                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low-grade temperature, increased white count, question free air
 under diaphragm.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, heart size is
 borderline, with a left ventricular configuration.  There is patchy opacity at
 both lung bases, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  Doubt CHF. 
 No gross effusion.  
 
 An unusual vertical linear lucency is seen along the left lateral border of
 the trachea.  The appearance is not suggestive of acute mediastinal air and it
 is of uncertain etiology, not suggestive of acute mediastinal air -- ? unusual
 bulla or artifact.  If clinically indicated, this could be further assessed
 with a lateral chest x-ray and/or chest CT.  
 
 Tubing noted over the upper abdomen.  No free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy opacity at both bases.  While this may very well represent
 atelectasis, the possibility of an early infectious infiltrate cannot be
 entirely excluded.
 
 2.  No free air detected beneath the diaphragm.
 
 Unusual lucency in the left paratracheal region, question artifact or unusual
 bulla.  Mediastinal air is considered much less likely.  See comment above.
