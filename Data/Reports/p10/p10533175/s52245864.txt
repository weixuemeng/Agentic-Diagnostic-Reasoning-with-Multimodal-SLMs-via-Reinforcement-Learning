                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Biliary drainage, evaluation for new cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a
 right upper quadrant drain.  The extent of the right pleural effusion has
 minimally increased, as has the atelectasis at the right lung bases. 
 Otherwise, no relevant change is seen.  In particular, there is no evidence
 for pneumonia.  Crowding of the vascular structures in the perihilar areas is
 caused by a decrease in lung volumes.
