                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  AP chest x-ray ___, PA and lateral chest x-ray
 ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis.  Evaluate for right pleural
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The
 band-like area of atelectasis at the right lateral lung base is improved;
 however, there are worsening opacities in the bilateral retrocardiac areas. 
 There is also blunting of the bilateral costophrenic sulci.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Worsening bilateral retrocardiac opacities likely representing
 atelectasis.
