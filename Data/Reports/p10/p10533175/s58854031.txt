                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacity at the right lung base is most suggestive
 of atelectasis.  Lungs are clear of confluent consolidation or pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Previously identified left PICC is no longer seen.  Stents identified in the
 right upper quadrant may be biliary in location and as seen on prior.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity most suggestive of atelectasis, noting that
 infection cannot be excluded.  Please correlate clinically.
