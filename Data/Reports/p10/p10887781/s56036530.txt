 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia and
 congestive heart failure, on diuretics and antibiotics, interval change.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 07:33 a.m.
 
 There is substantial interval progression of multifocal bilateral opacities
