                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain after bicycle accident.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Streaky medial right lower lung opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Along the mid thoracic spine, there is a mild
 wedge compression deformity, which is age-indeterminate and not necessarily
 recent but somewhat unusual in this age group.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild mid thoracic wedge compression deformity, indeterminate as to
 age and not fully characterized, although possible due to an older injury. 
 Further investigation could be considered with CT, however, if focal findings
 suggest that it may potentially represent an acute process; correlation with
 physical findings and any history of prior trauma is recommended.
