                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. 
 No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 There is apical nodularity and calcification, most likely reflecting old
 granulomatous disease.  However, in the absence of images at least ___ years
 previously demonstrating no change, activity of this process cannot be
 unequivocally excluded.  All effort should be made to obtain prior chest
 radiographs from another facility.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
