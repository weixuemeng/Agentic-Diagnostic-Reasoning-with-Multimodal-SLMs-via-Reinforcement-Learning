                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistant cough  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable well-marginated area of increased opacity overlies the apical region of
 the left lung, and could potentially continue beyond the confines of the left
 apex. Additionally, a second area of asymmetrical increased opacity is present
 just below this region at the level of the first anterior rib and medial left
 clavicle.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There are no
 pleural effusions or acute skeletal structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetrical area of increased opacity overlying left lung apex, potentially
 external to the patient.  A followup apical lordotic radiograph with
 repositioning of the patient area removal of any external structures would be
 helpful for initial further evaluation, particularly to exclude left apical
 infectious pneumonia or other acute lung process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 11:36 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
