                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest for graft demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable relative to prior examination
 dated ___.  Nodular opacities within the right infrahilar region
 are likely within soft tissue when correlated with the lateral projection and
 are present on prior exams. There is no evidence of pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes involve the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No opacity convincing for pneumonia.
