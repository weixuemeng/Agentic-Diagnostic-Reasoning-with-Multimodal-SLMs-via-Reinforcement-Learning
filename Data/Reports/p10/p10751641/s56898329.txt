                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and near syncope.  Question
 infiltrate, pneumonia or failure.
 
 FINDINGS: Compared with prior, there has been no significant interval change. 
 Again seen are subtle peribronchial wall thickening identified in the right
 lower lobe.  Nodular opacities are also seen in the right mid lung. 
 Elsewhere, lungs remain clear.  Costophrenic angles are sharp.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bronchial wall thickening in the right lower lobe and
 nodular opacities in the right mid lung.  Given persistence of these findings,
 CT chest should be considered.
