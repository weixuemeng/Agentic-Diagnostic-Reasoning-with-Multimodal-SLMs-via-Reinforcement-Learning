                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year old woman with CHF exacerbation and acute chest pressure
 and cough  // Acute pulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and multiple priors.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Subtle interstitial changes are mildly
 increased from prior imaging.  Atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally is
 mild.  The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Aortic calcifications are
 dense.  A small amount of pleural thickening or pleural fluid is seen at the
 right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle increased interstitial changes could represent progression of mild
 interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia or asymmetric edema.
 
 2.  Aortic valve calcifications on prior CT were considerable and could be
 contributing to the patient's symptoms.
