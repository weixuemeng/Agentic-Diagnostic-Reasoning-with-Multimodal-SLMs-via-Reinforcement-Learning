                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased secretions  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP view of the chest provided.   An ET tube ends 2.0 cm above the
 Carina. An orogastric tube extends below the level of the diaphragm, the
 distal tip is not visualized. A left PICC ends at the distal SVC.
 
 Retrocardiac and left basilar consolidation is unchanged. There is suggestion
 of a mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures, however this may be due to
 rotation.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac and left basilar opacity are unchanged. Additionally, there is
 suggestion of a mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures, however this
 may be due to rotation. A nonobliqued image may be useful to assess whether
 the retrocardiac and left basilar opacities are due to volume loss or possibly
 pneumonia.
