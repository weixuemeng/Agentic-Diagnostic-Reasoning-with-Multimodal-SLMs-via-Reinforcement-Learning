                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left subclavian catheter has
 been removed.  The tracheostomy tube and right subclavian catheters remain in
 good position.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter
 of the heart in this patient with moderate pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac
 opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Probable bilateral small pleural
 effusions.
