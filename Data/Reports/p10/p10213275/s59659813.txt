                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post trachea revision.  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally increased.  Increasing opacities in the
 right perihilar region and right lower lobe could be asymmetric edema but
 aspiration cannot be excluded; attention in followup is recommended.  Small
 right effusion has increased.  Small left effusion is stable. 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Tracheostomy is in standard position.
