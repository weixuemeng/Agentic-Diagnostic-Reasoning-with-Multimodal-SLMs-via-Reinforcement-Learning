                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position, unchanged from the
 prior exam.  A right PICC is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC.
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower, somewhat accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is unchanged mild edema.  The right basilar
 atelectasis has improved.  There is no new opacity, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.  Improving atelectasis.
