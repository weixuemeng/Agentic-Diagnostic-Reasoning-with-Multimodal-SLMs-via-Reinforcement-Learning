                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough and fever with
 yellow sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left lower
 lobe consolidation is worrisome for pneumonia.  The right lung is clear.  No
 definite pleural effusion is seen although a trace left pleural effusion will
 be difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  There may be minimal
 apical pleural thickening.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
