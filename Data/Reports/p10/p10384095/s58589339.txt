                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  NONE AVAIL
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Thumb the act enlargement is accompanied by a tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 a. Lung volumes are slightly low, and the lateral radiograph is further
 limited by respiratory motion.  Lungs are clear except for a nonspecific
 patchy opacity at the right lung base. No pleural effusion. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lobe opacity could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration,
 or an early focus of infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs
 may be helpful in this regard.
