                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle collision with rib fractures; please
 evaluate for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  Rounded opacity projecting over the
 right upper lung adjacent to anterolateral fourth rib deformity may reflect
 sequaelae of trauma.  Known acute left lower limb fracture is not well
 appreciated on current study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Opacity projecting over right upper lung with adjacent rib deformity may
 reflect prior injury. Recommend re-evaluation in 6 weeks to assess for
 resolution.
