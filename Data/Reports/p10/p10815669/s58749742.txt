                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with PICC line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is limited due to the field of view.  The lower aspect of the
 lung field has been cut off.  There is a new left-sided PICC line with distal
 lead tip at the cavoatrial junction/distal SVC.  There is again seen
 prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with the patient's
 known pulmonary fibrosis.  Overlapping pulmonary edema would be difficult to
 exclude.  There are no pneumothoraces.
