 measures 1.5 cm. Left pigtail pleural catheter is positioned with side holes
 within the pleural space. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema extends along the
 left lateral chest wall. A fiducial marker in the left upper lobe is new with
 ill-defined surrounding opacity consistent with post ablative changes. Lung
 volumes are low. Heart size is stable.
