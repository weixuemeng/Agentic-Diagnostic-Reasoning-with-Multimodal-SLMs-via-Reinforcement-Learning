                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is not substantially changed in the interval. 
 The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is a mild pulmonary
 edema, worse in the interval with moderate size bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left, also increased since the previous study.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect areas of compressive atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  A fiducial marker is noted within the left
 upper lobe.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multiple compression fractures within
 the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is
 difficult to exclude.
