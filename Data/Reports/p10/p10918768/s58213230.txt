 INDICATION:   ___F with cough, hx effusion and ptx and pna , recent admission,
 pls eval the above differential  // History: ___F with cough, hx effusion and

 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to previous exam, prior left-sided pneumothorax known longer
 visualized. Prior left pleural catheter is also been removed. There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions, similar to prior. Fiducial marker in left upper
 lobe region of consolidation is again noted. Increased interstitial markings
 throughout the lungs are likely due to chronic lung disease with superimposed
 vascular congestion. Linear right basilar opacity suggests atelectasis.
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior. Compression deformities in
 the thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small bilateral effusions with COPD and likely pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
