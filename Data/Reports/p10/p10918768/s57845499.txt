                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with two days of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated but clear of focal consolidation or effusion.  Slightly
 increased interstitial markings are seen throughout.  The cardiac silhouette
 is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the
 aortic arch.  There is a severe compression deformity in the lower thoracic
 spine, age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflation without focal consolidation.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs could be chronic and due to
 underlying chronic parenchymal changed although interstitial edema is also
 possible.
 2.  Severe compression deformity in the lower thoracic spine which is age
 indeterminant given lack of priors to document chronicity and clinical
 correlation is suggested.
