                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pharyngitis, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view of the chest provided.  Evaluation is
 somewhat limited due to underpenetration of the lung bases, though allowing
 for technical limitations, the lungs appear clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with
 possible borderline cardiomegaly.  The bony structures are intact.
