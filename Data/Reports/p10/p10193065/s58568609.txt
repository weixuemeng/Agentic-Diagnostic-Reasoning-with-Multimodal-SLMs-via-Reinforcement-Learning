                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with respiratory failure, s/p intubation  // ? ETT
 placement, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina.  An enteric tube
 extends to at least the body of the stomach, but the inferior aspect is not
 captured on the current study.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild alveolar pulmonary edema.  No other consolidation.
 No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar
 to the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina.  Repositioning
 should be considered.
 2. Mild alveolar pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.
