                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMH of heart issue (pt is confused and no
 records), now with CP and SOB, edema on exam  // any e/o pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately a markedly enlarged.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  In the left mid to lower lung retrocardiac region there is an apparent
 rounded opacity, measuring approximately 1.9 x 1.5 cm ; the differential
 diagnosis being pulmonary nodule versus artifact.  Recommend follow-up chest
 CT for further assessment.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 1.9 x 1.5 cm rounded opacity in the left mid to lower hemi thorax, projecting
 over the cardiac shadow, differential diagnosis includes pulmonary nodule
 versus artifact.  Recommend followup non emergent chest CT for further
 assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Non emegent chest CT for further evaluation of left mid to
 lower hemi thorax nodular opacity.
