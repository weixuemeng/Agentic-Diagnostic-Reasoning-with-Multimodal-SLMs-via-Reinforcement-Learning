                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia, ?  Altered mental status, diffuse
 abdominal tenderness  // Eval for pneumonia, acute abdominal pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again noted.  The aortic
 contour remains tortuous with dilatation of the ascending aorta appearing
 unchanged.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures
 and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  12 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the left lower lobe is better demonstrated on the
 previous chest CT.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 2. 12 mm nodular opacity within the left lower lobe, better assessed on
 previous chest CT, and for which PET-CT is suggested for further assessment.
