                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess lines and tubes, patient with aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.  
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Cardiomegaly is partially imaged.  Consolidation in the right lower
 lobe has markedly improved.  There are still large consolidations in the right
 lung. Large consolidation in the left lower lobe associated with loss of
 volume has worsened.   Amount of pleural effusion on the left is probably
 small.
