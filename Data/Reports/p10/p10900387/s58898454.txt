                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis status post flash pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, the ET tube and NG tube has been removed.  
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly involving both right and left ventricles,
 with unfolding of the aorta.  There is upper zone re-distribution and mild
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, improved compared with the prior film.
 No gross pleural effusion is now visible, consistent with interval clearing of
 the effusions.  There has also been re-expansion of the left lower lobe and
 resolution of the increased retrocardiac density.  Some patchy opacity
 overlying the right lung base medially is again noted.  Increased density in
 the right paratracheal soft tissue density again noted, similar to the  
 ___ chest CT scout film, where it appeared to represent mediastinal soft
 tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) Marked cardiomegaly again seen.
 2) Interval improvement in previously seen CHF, LLL collapse, and pleural
 effusion. 
 3) Right paratracheal soft tissue density, unchanged.
