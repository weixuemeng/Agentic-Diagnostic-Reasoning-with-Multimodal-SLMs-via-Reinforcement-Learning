 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with. New tachypnea and and low grade fever ? new
 PNA  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single view at ___ 7:33 PM
 
 COMPARISON:   ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC line is noted. Persistent interstitial lung disease
 remains. I remain concern that there may be a left basilar process although
 this appears improved since the previous study.  The heart is borderline.. 
 The osseous structures are normal for age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change in the interstitial disease which has been present on multiple
 previous examinations.
 
 Increased markings in the retrocardiac area which could indicate early
 consolidation.  This has improved since the previous examination although this
 could be a matter technique.
