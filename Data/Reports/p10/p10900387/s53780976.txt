                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, multiple medical problems with fever 
 // Eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous rapid clearing of relatively severe consolidation in the right lung,
 and interstitial edema in the left between ___ and ___ suggests that
 edema was the explanation for abnormalities in both lungs. Today there is a
 return of the widespread interstitial abnormality in both lungs which I think
 is probably edema, particularly because the mild cardiomegaly is worse and
 pulmonary vasculature is engorged.
 
 There is also greater consolidation in the left lower lung, due to atelectasis
 or pneumonia. No pneumothorax is present.
