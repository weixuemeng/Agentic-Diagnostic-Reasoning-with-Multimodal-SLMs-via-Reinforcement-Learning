  1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
  2. Orogastric tube terminates in the distal esophagus and needs to be advanced
  by at least 18 cm.
  3. Persistent opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward shift of
  mediastinal structures indicative of left lung collapse. Probable small left
  pleural effusion. Abrupt cut off of the distal left mainstem bronchus suggests
  an endobronchial lesion such as mucous plugging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath s/p intubation  // ET
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip terminates in the distal esophagus with side port in the
 upper/mid esophagus. There is persistent left hemithorax opacification with
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures indicative of left lung collapse.
 Probable small left pleural effusion is likely present. As noted previously
 there is a abrupt cut off of visualization of the distal left mainstem
 bronchus. Right PICC tip remains in unchanged position within the lower SVC.
 Remainder of the right lung is unchanged. Punctate radiopaque densities in the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen likely reflect ingested material within the
 bowel.
