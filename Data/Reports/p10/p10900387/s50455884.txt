                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CTA chest dated ___, and chest
 radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior exam dated ___, the right lower lobe
 opacity is essentially unchanged.  Given that no lesion was identified on the
 more recent CTA exam, this focus likely represents overlying pectoral muscle. 
 The remainder of the lungs are essentially clear without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged from the prior exam.
