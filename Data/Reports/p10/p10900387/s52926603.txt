                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly with worsening bilateral
 interstitial opacities and fissural thickening compatible with worsening
 pulmonary edema.  Somewhat more dense opacity of the right base may reflect
 pneumonia.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly with worsening interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Dense opacity in the right middle lobe obscuring the right heart border
 may reflect pneumonia although the appearance was similar during prior
 episodes of pulmonary edema.  Followup chest radiographs are suggested after
 treatment of pulmonary edema to ensure there is no underlying pneumonia.
