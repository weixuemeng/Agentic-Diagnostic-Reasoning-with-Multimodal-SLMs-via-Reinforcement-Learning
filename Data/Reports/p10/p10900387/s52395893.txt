                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of PEA arrest, status post intubation.  Please evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 6.6 cm above the carina. 
 Right-sided PIC line terminates in the low SVC.  Opacities at the lung bases
 bilaterally have increased compared to the prior exam.  There is persistent
 mild pulmonary edema, overall unchanged compared to the prior exam.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable compared to exams dated back to ___.  There
 appears to be an increase in a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 evidence for pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in opacities at the lung bases bilaterally.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Enteric tube terminates just below the gastroesophageal junction; if this
 tube is to be used for feeding, this must be advanced further into the body of
 the stomach.
