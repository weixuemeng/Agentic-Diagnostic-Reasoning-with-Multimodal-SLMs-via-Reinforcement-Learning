 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a fever of unknown, on dialysis, HIV,
 presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC terminates near the cavoatrial junction. There is complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift,
 consistent with left lung collapse. A small component of a left pleural
 effusion is also likely present.  There appears to be an abrupt cut-off of
 visualization of the left mainstem brochus. The right lung is grossly clear.
 Possible 4 mm nodular opacity is seen projecting over the right mid lung
 field. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung collapse with probable small component of left pleural effusion. 
 Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
