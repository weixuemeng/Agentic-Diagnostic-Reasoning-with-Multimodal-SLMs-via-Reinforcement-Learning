 INDICATION:  ESRD on HD (___), HIV on HAART (CD4 373), HCV,
 polysubstance abuse on methadone, cryoglobulinemia, sCHF ___ NICM, resistant
 hypertension and GERD, s/p PEA arrest w/ neurologic devastation on ___ in
 the setting of HTN emergency (flash pulmonary edema), in MICU w/ myoclonic
 seizures prior to cooling protocol, and since protocol completed has continued
 to have seizures on quadruple AED therapy and new tachpnea  // eval pulm
 edema, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Also prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrate increased
 opacification of the right hemithorax, with persistently enlarged cardiac
 silhouette and engorged hilar vasculature, consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 There is dense opacification of the retrocardiac space which may represent
 atelectasis, however pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right-sided PICC line ends at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Increased opacification the right hemithorax with persistent large
 cardiac silhouette and engorged hilar vasculature, consistent with pulmonary
 edema.
 
 2.  Dense opacification of retrocardiac space may represent atelectasis,
 however pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
