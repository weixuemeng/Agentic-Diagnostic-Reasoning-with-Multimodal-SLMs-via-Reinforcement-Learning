                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left basilar opacity has improved since the prior study, with similar
 appearance of bilateral interstitial opacities. Medial right lung base opacity
 is likely atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There
 is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, has slightly increased; and left
 basilar opacity has improved since the prior study.
 2. Bilateral interstitial opacities persist, most likely edema, however PCP
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting, as it can
 have a similar radiographic appearance.
