 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest.  There is persistent elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle suggestive
 of small effusion versus atelectasis, unchanged from remote prior.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 The trachea is deviated to the right at the thoracic inlet suggestive of
 underlying asymmetric thyroid enlargement, unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
