                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits for age. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. No
 obvious pneumothorax is detected. Linear density seen at the right lung apex
 immediately above the clavicle is equivocal for pneumothorax. No significant
 atelectasis is detected. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Faint linear density at right lung apex is equivocal for pneumothorax. If
 this is of clinical concern, then further assessment with an AP view obtained
 at end-expiration of the respiratory cycle could help for further assessment.
 2. Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process is identified. No focal infiltrate
 detected to suggest pneumonia.
