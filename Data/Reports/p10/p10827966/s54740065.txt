                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with line readjustment
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip has been slightly withdrawn
 with tip projecting over in the region of the upper SVC however curved
 appearance of the distal aspect of the catheter may suggest that it is
 approaching the azygos vein.  Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  Bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is present.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is re-
 demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema.  Assessment of the medial lung
 apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of left internal jugular central venous catheter projects over the upper
 SVC however the curved configuration of the distal aspect of the catheter
 suggests that it may lie within the azygos vein.  A lateral view may help
 confirm positioning of the line.
