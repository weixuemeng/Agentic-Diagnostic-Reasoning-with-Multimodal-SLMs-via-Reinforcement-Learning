                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diffuse abdominal pain, tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is
 calcified.  The aorta appears tortuous but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but
 no pulmonary edema is present.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 thorax is seen.  Clips are demonstrated overlying the left lung apex medially.
 There is no free air under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
