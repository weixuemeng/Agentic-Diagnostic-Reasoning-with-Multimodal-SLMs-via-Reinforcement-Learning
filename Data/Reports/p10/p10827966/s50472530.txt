                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Aside
 from streaky left basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis, which has improved,
 the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Endplate sclerosis suggests sequela of renal
 osteodystrophy ("rugger ___" spine).  There is similar exaggerated kyphotic
 curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
