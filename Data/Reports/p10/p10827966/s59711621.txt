                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and productive sputum, rule
 out process, post-hemodialysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar examination of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement as
 before.  Somewhat widened and elongated thoracic aorta unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature again somewhat congested, but no acute interstitial or
 alveolar edema is identified, nor is there evidence of pleural effusion in
 lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  As already identified on the preceding
 chest examination, there is a sizable triangular density in the mediastinal
 contours of the left hemithorax blending and obscuring the central half of the
 left-sided diaphragm.  In the left basal periphery, a thin plate additional
 atelectasis can be seen.  No pneumothorax is identified.  In comparison with
 the next preceding examination of yesterday, the findings are stable.  Review
 of the next preceding chest examination of ___ demonstrates
 beginning changes that herald this atelectasis but still the major portion of
 the left lower lobe pulmonary parenchyma was aerated.  Older chest
 examinations include that of ___, in which some beginning
 atelectasis could be seen on the left base but by no means as massive as it
 exists now.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progressing sizable left lower lobe atelectasis as seen on PA and
 lateral chest examinations.  Cause of this lesion is unclear.  If evaluation
 is required, the next step would be a chest CT.  As before, patient has a
 marked kyphotic curvature on the lateral view and typical endplate sclerosis
 as a characteristic for chronic renal osteopathy.
