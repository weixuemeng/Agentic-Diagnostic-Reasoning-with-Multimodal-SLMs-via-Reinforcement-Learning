                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chills and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Streaky left retrocardiac opacities are not significantly changed compared to
 the prior study from ___, likely atelectasis, although infection
 cannot be excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is minimal fluid or
 thickening within the minor fissure.  The heart size is top normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  No definite pleural effusions are seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Marked thoracic kyphosis is redemonstrated, with
 mild loss of height of several thoracic vertebral bodies, not significantly
 changed. There is widespread endplate sclerosis, compatable with renal
 osteodystrophy. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper abdominal quadrant,
 as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky retrocardiac opacities, not significantly changed
 compared to radiographs from ___, likely atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be excluded.
