                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and weight gain,
 evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  An
 exaggerated thoracic kyphosis is again noted.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.  Increased bilateral perihilar opacification and diffuse
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature reflects mild pulmonary edema, 
 slightly worse compared to the prior examination.  Mild thickening of the
 minor fissure persists. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema has increased.
 2.  Stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly.
 3.  Improved left lower lobe atelectasis.
