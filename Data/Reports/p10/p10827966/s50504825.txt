                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia or effusion 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular
 congestion are slightly worse from prior study.   No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.   Bibasilar opacities could represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema; however, infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 context.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Skeletal changes of renal
 osteodystrophy are accompanied by mild compression deformities of several
 thoracic vertebral bodies.
