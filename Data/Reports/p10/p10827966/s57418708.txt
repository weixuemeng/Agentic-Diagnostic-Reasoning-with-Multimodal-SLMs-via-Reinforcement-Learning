                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Hilar engorgement is
 indicative of fluid overload along with patchy scattered increased
 reticulation compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.  Linear retrocardiac
 densities are similar to prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.  Infection cannot be excluded given the
 appropriate clinical circumstance, particularly with slightly more prominent
 retrocardiac opacity.
