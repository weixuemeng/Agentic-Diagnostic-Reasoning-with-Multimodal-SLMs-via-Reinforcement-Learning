 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.

 imaged femoral-approach tip overlies the lower right atrium
 
 There is diffuse severe kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with partial loss of
 vertebral body height at seevral levels and "rigger ___" appearance
 suggestive of hyperparathyroidism, probably unchanged c/w ___ CT.
