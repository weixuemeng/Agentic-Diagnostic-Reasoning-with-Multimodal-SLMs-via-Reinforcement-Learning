                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and history of end stage
 renal disease on hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a
 persistent streaky retrocardiac opacity which is nonspecific in character but
 given chronicity is probably due to scarring or atelectasis.  Elsewhere the
 lungs appear clear within the limitations of technique.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity, but unchanged, so no definite acute process.
