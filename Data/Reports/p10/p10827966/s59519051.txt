                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and cough, to rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are extremely low
 resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Within this
 limitation, no definite consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Left lower lobe opacity, likely represent
 atelectasis.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are stable with minimal calcification in the aortic arch. Again seen
 is severe kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with a rugger ___ spine
 appearance, indicating renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology in this limited study.
