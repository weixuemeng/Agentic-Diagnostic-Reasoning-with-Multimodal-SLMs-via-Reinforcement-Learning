                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypotension, cough, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Subtle linear
 opacities at the lung bases likely represent basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise,
 the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  An
 exaggerated thoracic kyphosis with several mid thoracic vertebral body
 compression deformities is unchanged in appearance in comparison to prior
 exams.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar atelectasis.  No focal lung consolidation.
