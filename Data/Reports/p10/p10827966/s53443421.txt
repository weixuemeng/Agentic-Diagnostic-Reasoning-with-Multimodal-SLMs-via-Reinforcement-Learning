 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:09 PM
  A left internal jugular central venous line is present, its tip which projects
  at the anticipated location of the superior vena cava.  Relative to prior
  examination, PICC catheter tip no longer takes a turn caudally.  A lateral
  would be helpful for definite confirmation out of the azygos.  The heart is
  stable in size.  Calcifications involve the aortic arch. Lung volumes are low.
  Streaky opacities at the bases reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or large
  pleural effusion is identified.
