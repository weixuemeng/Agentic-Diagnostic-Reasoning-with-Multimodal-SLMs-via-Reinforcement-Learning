                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___, and CT chest without contrast on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is segmental atelectasis of the
 left lower lobe.  No other focal opacities are identified.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is reidentified but the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  Apparent engorgement of the azygos vein is unchanged
 from prior examinations.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Exaggerated kyphosis increases anteroposterior diameter of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly, left lower lobe atelectasis and engorged
 azygos vein are chronic. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia
 pneumonia.
