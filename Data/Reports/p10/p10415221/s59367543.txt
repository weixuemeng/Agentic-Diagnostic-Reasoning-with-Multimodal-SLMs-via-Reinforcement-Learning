                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal, AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited due to the patient's body habitus and low
 lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for this
 limitation, there is no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly
 may be present but assessment is limited by lung hypoinflation and AP
 projection.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited due to low lung volumes. No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
