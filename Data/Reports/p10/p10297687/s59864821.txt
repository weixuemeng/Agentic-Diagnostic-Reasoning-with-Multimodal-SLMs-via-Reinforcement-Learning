                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain.  Evaluate for evidence of
 basilar pneumonia or abdominal free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for vascular crowding. 
 The right lung does not demonstrate any focal opacities. The left lung apex
 demonstrates an ill-defined opacity projecting over the posteromedial aspects
 of the second and third ribs.  No other focal opacities are noted on the left.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of abdominal free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity in the left apex might represent summation of
 structures, and it could be further evaluated with AP lordotic view to assess
 for underlying opacity.
