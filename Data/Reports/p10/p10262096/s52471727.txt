 HISTORY:  Hypoxia with possible evolving infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is
 continued low lung volume.  This may account for much of the fullness of the
 pulmonary vasculature and mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  Areas of
 more patchy opacification are seen at the left base and just above the minor
 fissure on the right.  This raises the possibility of developing
 consolidation.
