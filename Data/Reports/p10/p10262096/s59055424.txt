                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  For ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube
 in place.  It is difficult to precisely see the tip, but it appears to be
 extremely close to the carina and should be pulled back several cm.  This
 information was telephoned to the resident taking care of the patient.
 
 Otherwise, there is slightly better inspiration.  Continued opacification at
 the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
