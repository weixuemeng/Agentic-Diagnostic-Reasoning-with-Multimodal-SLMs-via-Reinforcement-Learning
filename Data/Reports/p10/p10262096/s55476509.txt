                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, failed left subclavian 9.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:  5.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes with likely bilateral pleural effusions.  Perihilar
 opacities likely relate to pulmonary edema.  Patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity could relate to pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  Mildly
 heart size cannot be adequately assessed, grossly, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable to prior.  There may again be prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural
 effusions, left base opacity could be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis, although consolidation is not excluded.  Likely component of
 pulmonary edema.
