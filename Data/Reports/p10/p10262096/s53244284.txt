                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  As previously noted, lung volumes remain low.  There are
 subtle patchy opacities in the lungs bilaterally.  There is possible
 left-sided pleural effusion.    Left diaphragm is not clearly delineated. 
 Prominence of the hila again noted.  Cardiac silhouette is stable. 
 Degenerative changes are again seen at the glenohumeral joints.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited portable exam.  Bilateral patchy opacities, potentially
 due to atelectasis given low lung volumes and; however, pulmonary edema is
 also possible, underlying aspiration/infection difficult to exclude.  Possible
 left effusion  If possible, repeat two-view chest x-ray would help to further
 characterize.
