 Comparison to ___ at 12:16.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 17:40 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line tip in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm, coiled within the stomach.  Endotracheal tube
 has been removed.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with probable layering bilateral effusions.  Bibasilar
 patchy opacities are seen which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature
 with no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  Calcification of the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  Mild thoracolumbar curvature with associated
 degenerative changes.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
