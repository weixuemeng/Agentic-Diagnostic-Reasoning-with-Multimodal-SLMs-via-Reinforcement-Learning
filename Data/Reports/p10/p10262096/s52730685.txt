                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained
 for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which coils within the proximal stomach
 before terminating within the distal stomach.  With the exception of a change
 in the position of a nasogastric tube, there is otherwise no relevant change
 in the appearance of the chest since the recent study performed earlier the
 same date.
