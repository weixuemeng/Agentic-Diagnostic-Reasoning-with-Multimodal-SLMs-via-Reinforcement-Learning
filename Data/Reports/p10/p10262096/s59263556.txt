                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New left IJ central venous line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:42.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided internal jugular
 central venous catheter terminating at the proximal SVC/brachiocephalic-SVC
 junction.  Low lung volumes persist and there are increasing perihilar
 opacities worrisome for worsening pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are again seen.  Again, left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which
 may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis; however,
 underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminating at the proximal SVC/brachiocephalic-SVC junction without evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Persistent low lung volumes.  Perihilar opacities raising
 concern for worsening pulmonary edema, somewhat similar compared to the study
 from 16:05 but appear worse as compared to the study from 17:42 today.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion; however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.
