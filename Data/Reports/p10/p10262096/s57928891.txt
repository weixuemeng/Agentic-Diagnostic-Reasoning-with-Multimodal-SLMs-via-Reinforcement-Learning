                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, hypotension, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest provided.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions with ground-glass opacities in the upper lungs,
 which could reflect pulmonary edema.  Consolidative opacities in the lower
 lungs, difficult to exclude.  The heart size cannot be assessed.  The
 mediastinal contour is optimally assessed due to patient leftward rotation. 
 Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with associated ground-glass
 opacities in the upper lungs, likely pulmonary edema.  Commence followup to
 resolution.
