                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, status post intubation, check ET tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  An ET tube is present. The carina is not optimally
 demonstrated, but ET tube likely lies approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A right
 subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 As noted, there are low inspiratory volumes.  Superimposed on this, there is
 cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution and diffuse interstitial edema
 with some more confluent alveolar opacities in both lung bases.  Probable
 small bilateral effusions.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is
 again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) ET tube in satisfactory position above the carina.  Lines and tubes as
 described.  
 2) Suspect increased CHF compared with ___ at 16:18 p.m.  Also, small
 effusions and bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  Please note that these
 findings can all be accentuated by low lung volumes, but the degree of
 inspiration is similar to the earlier film and the opacities are new.  
 3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation itself is unchanged.
