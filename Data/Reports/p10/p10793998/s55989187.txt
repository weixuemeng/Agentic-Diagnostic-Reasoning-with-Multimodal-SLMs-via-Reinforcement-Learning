                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia.  For followup.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is left lower lobe opacification, most compatible with healing pneumonia
 with an associated small left pleural effusion.  There are no other areas of
 focal parenchymal opacification.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with healing left lower lobe pneumonia
 and an associated pleural effusion. Recommend repeat radiographs in six weeks
 to ensure resolution.
