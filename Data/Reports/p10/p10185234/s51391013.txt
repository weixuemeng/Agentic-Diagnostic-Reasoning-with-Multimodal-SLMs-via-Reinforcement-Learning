                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, nausea and vomiting, and decreased breath sounds. 
 Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior radiograph, there has been interval decrease
 in lung volumes, which accentuates the cardiomediastinal contours and
 bronchovascular structures.  Small right sided pleural effusion is unchanged
 since the prior study. Right lung base opacity may represent infection or
 atelectasis, and is similar since the prior study. No pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal contours are otherwise within normal limits.  No bony abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung field opacity may be infection or atelectasis.
 Small right pleural effusion is unchanged since ___, given lower lung
 volumes.
