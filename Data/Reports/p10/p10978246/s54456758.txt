                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, CAD, myelodysplastic syndrome shortness of
 breath. Left lower lung fields with crackles  // R/O CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and interstitial pulmonary edema is
 moderate, though somewhat asymmetric. Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted,
 more significant on the right.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small, best
 appreciated on the lateral view. The descending thoracic aorta is calcified
 and otherwise unremarkable. Biapical pleural thickening is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Small left
 pleural effusion.
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities, greater on the right, likely representing
 atelectasis and dependent edema. Careful followup advised to exclude
 concurrent pneumonia.
