 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bleeding, hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, status post stenting. 
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes continue
 to be low.  Areas of atelectasis are still seen at both the right and left
 lung bases.  Signs of mild fluid overload are now present that were not seen
 on the previous examination.  Consistent with this observation is a slight
 increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
