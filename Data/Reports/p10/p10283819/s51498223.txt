                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bleeding hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm status post stenting,
 evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. 
 The trachea distal to the ET tube tip and the carina itself are poorly
 defined, ?due to secretions opacifying the airway.  There are low inspiratory
 volumes.  There is vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low inspiratory
 volumes.  There is some patchy increased retrocardiac density, slightly worse
 than on ___ at 21:22 p.m., but not significantly changed compared with
 ___ at 2:42 a.m.  There is patchy atelectasis at the right lung base and
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, overall similar to the prior
 film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible slight worsening of CHF findings with some interval
 worsening of patchy opacity at both bases.  Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
