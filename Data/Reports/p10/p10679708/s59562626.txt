                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung lesion s/p R thoracotomy, RML/RLL
 bilobectomy  //  r/o ptx, htx, effusion, atelectasis - ** obtain ___ at
 0500h **
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray  from ___ at 11:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The overall appearance is similar.   No obvious pneumothorax is detected in
 either lung.
 
 Again seen is the right-sided chest tube with opacification at the right lung
 base, presumably a small to moderate right pleural effusion with underlying
 atelectasis and probable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right
 paratracheal opacity is unchanged.
 
 There is continued vascular plethora.
 
 Aside from minimal basilar atelectasis and a small left effusion, left lung
 remains grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but
 unchanged.
 
 Linear density previously seen over the right lung, question epidural
 catheter, is no longer visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Overall appearance similar to the film from 1 day earlier.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
