                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R thoracotomy RML/RLL bilobectomy  // r/o
 ptx, htx, atelectasis, consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are findings consistent with thoracotomy and a right chest tube is
 present.  Linear density projecting over the right lung may represent an
 epidural catheter and is similar in appearance.
 
 Again seen is a small right effusion, minimally larger, with atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  The possibility of
 slight rightward shift of the mediastinum cannot be excluded.
 
 There is mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
 
 On the left, no focal consolidation is identified.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion, essentially unchanged, with minimal left base atelectasis. 
 No left-sided pneumothorax.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right effusion, with elevated right hemidiaphragm and underlying
 atelectasis.  Probable slight right which shift of mediastinum, unchanged.  No
 frank consolidation detected.
 2. Mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
 3. No pneumothorax detected in either lung.  Thoracotomy changes on the right
 side, with right chest tube noted.
 4. Minimal left base atelectasis and small left pleural effusion again noted.
