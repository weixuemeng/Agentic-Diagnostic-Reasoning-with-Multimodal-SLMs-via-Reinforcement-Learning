                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fall off bicycle with hematoma over the right clavicle,
 question fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 an acute fracture involving the mid shaft of the right clavicle with overlap
 of fracture fragments and a small adjacent triangular fracture fragment. 
 Widened right AC joint is also present, concerning for an AC joint separation,
 likely grade III.  The imaged right upper ribs appear intact.  No
 pneumothorax.  Hardware is partially imaged in the left proximal humerus.  No
 large consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mildly comminuted fracture through the mid shaft of the right clavicle.
 2.  Widening of the right AC joint with slight elevation of the right distal
 clavicle, concerning for a type III AC joint separation.
 3.  No pneumothorax or definite signs of rib fracture.  Consider dedicated rib
 series if strong clinical concern.
