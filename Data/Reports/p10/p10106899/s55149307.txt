                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of dyspnea.  Evaluate for heart failure versus
 infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is indistinct.  Hazy perihilar opacities and
 ill-defined pulmonary vascular markings are consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles and basilar opacities are compatible with
 moderate-sized pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  Narrowing of the
 right acromiohumeral interval is consistent with rotator cuff injury. 
 Deformity of the distal right clavicle is compatible with a prior injury at
 this location.  Leads of a right chest wall pacer terminate over the right
 atrium and ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions
 and atelectasis.
