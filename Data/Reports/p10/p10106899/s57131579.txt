                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with CAD status post recent NSTEMI, admitted
 for CHF exacerbation, now requiring assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pulmonary vasculature is less dilated and there is less pulmonary
 edema than on prior exam.  There is a right pleural effusion.  There is plate
 atelectasis in the left mid zone.  The right ventricle pacer wire passes in a
 supero-oblique direction within the heart instead the usual infero-oblique
 direction.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed due to
 bilateral bibasilar opacities.  There is a possibility that there an
 underlying pneumonia hidden by the pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. 
 Recommend followup imaging as the edema clears.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion.  Left basilar plate atelectasis. 
 Improving pulmonary edema.  Recommend followup chest imaging to rule out
 pneumonia after pulmonary edema has cleared.
