                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with headache, slurred speech and seizure  //
 eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are grossly normal however there is diffuse hazy opacity bibasal
 E likely reflecting layering pleural effusions.  Bilateral basal airspace
 opacity likely therefore represents a atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.  Even allowing for the projection, the heart appears mildly
 enlarged.  Possible pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Difficult to exclude pulmonary edema given the pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax seen.
