                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post intubation.  Evaluate for tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited due to rightward rotation of the patient. 
 Allowing for this limitation, there is opacification of the right lower lung,
 likely due to a combination of atelectasis given volume loss with rightward
 mediastnal shift to the right and possible pleural effusion.  Small nodular
 opacities are seen in the aerated portion of the right lung, potentially
 vessels on end.  The left lung is clear.  There is no left-sided effusion. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Old bilateral rib fractures are
 identified.
 
 An endotracheal tube is seen ending approximately 4 cm above the carina.  An
 esophageal tube ends beyond the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of
 view.  Artifact from external monitoring and supporting devices is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe consolidation, likely a combination of atelectasis or
 consolidation with pleural effusion.
 
 2.  6 mm nodule in the aerated right upper lobe of unclear clinical
 significance but attention to this area suggested on followup exams.
 
 3.  Endotracheal and esophageal tubes in appropriate position.
