                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and new right IJ line
 placement.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately one hour prior to this
 exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new IJ line is identified, ending in the mid SVC.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise, there is no significant interval change
 compared with the previous examination, with opacification of the right lower
 lung field, likely a combination of at least some atelectasis and possible
 consolidation/pleural effusion.  The aerated portion of the right upper lung
 shows changes of interstitial edema.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 change in position of the endotracheal tube.  The NG tube tip is out of view. 
 Significant bilateral carotid calcifications are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New IJ line ends in the mid SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Otherwise, no significant change compared with recent chest radiographic
 examination.
