                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Palpitations.  History of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A lucency projecting immediately lateral to
 the right chest wall is probably due to abduction of the arm.  A mild pectus
 excavatum configuration is suspected.  There is possibly a trace pleural
 effusion on the left.  A linear opacity projecting over the left upper lung
 appears unchanged since the remote prior studies suggesting minor scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace pleural effusion on the left, otherwise unremarkable.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
