                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with metastatic colon cancer, now with abdominal
 pain, n/v, diarrhea  // evaluate for free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle right middle lobe patchy opacity obscures the right heart border on the
 frontal view and projects over the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view.
 Given this was not present 7 days prior, is felt to more likely represent
 pneumonia although underlying neoplastic process is not excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable and stable.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. Given patient's
 history of metastatic disease, neoplastic process is not excluded although
 given development since the prior chest radiograph from 7 days prior, felt to
 more likely represent pneumonia.
