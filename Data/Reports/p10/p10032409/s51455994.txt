                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  There is blunting
 of the costophrenic angles which could represent trace effusions or pleural
 thickening.  Flattening of the diaphragm and increased AP diameter of the
 chest is suggestive of COPD. Relative elevation of the left hemi-diaphragm is
 unchanged.  There is mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta.  Note is
 made of dense calcifications at the aortic root.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
