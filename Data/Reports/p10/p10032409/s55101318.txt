                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with weight loss.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen
 with tortuosity of the aorta.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
 
 Of incidental note are opacifications in the neck bilaterally that could
 represent calcification in the region of the carotid bifurcations.
