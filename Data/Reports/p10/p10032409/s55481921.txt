                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe COPD, respiratory failure, possible
 infiltrate vs. edema on prior CXR  // please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, heterogeneous opacities
 throughout the right lung have worsened and are concerning for developing
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Unilateral distribution of
 pulmonary edema in the setting of asymmetrical emphysema is considered less
 likely.  If the diagnosis is in doubt clinically, followup radiographs after
 diuresis may be helpful.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for slight increase in
 size of a small right pleural effusion.
