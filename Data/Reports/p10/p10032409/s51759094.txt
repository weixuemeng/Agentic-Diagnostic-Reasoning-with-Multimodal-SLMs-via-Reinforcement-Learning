 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or congestive heart failure in patient
 presenting with dyspnea, tachypnea, and increased oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is minimal blunting of the
 bilateral costovertebral angles which may represent small bilateral pleural
 effusions or be due to overlying soft tissue.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.
 There is stable minimal cardiomegaly.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions, which are difficult to fully
 evaluate due to overlying soft tissues.  PA and lateral views would be helpful
 for further evaluation is patient able
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Stable minimal cardiomegaly.
