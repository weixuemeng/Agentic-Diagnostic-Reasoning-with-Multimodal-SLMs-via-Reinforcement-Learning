                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS: ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and
 calcified.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus but similar to
 prior studies, suggesting scarring.  To a lesser degree, there is also
 blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus that appears unchanged. 
 Hemidiaphragms are flattened suggesting mild hyperinflation.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest, without evidence for acute
 disease.
