                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, history of COPD, pneumonia, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-ray performed ___.
 
 There is stable flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms with a relative
 paucity of vasculature in the left upper lung, consistent with reported
 history of COPD.  Stable mild bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles
 may represent a small pleural effusion.  No focal opacification concerning for
 pneumonia identified.  Mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall unchanged exam.  Stable minimal blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic angles may represent small effusions versus scarring.
