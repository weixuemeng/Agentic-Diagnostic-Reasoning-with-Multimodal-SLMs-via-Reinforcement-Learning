                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Note is again made of a linear opacity in the lingula, which is
 unchanged from the prior study and likely represents a scar.  No focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is noted, which appears symmetrical.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  A bulge at the aortic
 arch is stable from the prior study and corresponds to the patient's known
 pseudoaneurysm.  The trachea is midline.  Right-sided rib deformities are also
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable contour of the aortic arch and known pseudoaneurysm by chest
 radiography.
