                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bone marrow transplant and recent
 pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC has been removed.  Right mid lung opacities are not well
 appreciated on the current study suggesting they may have been due to
 aspiration.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with mediastinal surgical clips
 noted. Bulge in aortic contour compatible with aneurysm seen on prior chest CT
 evaluations. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of recent midlung opacities which as a result of their
 quick resolution may have been due to aspiration rather than pneumonia.
