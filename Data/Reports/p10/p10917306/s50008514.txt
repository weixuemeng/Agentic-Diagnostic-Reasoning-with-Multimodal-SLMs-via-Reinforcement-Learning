 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post CABG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. A right
 internal jugular central line appears to terminate at the cavoatrial junction.
 Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggests scarring or alternatively
 small pleural effusions. Obscuraion of the left hemidiaphragm likely
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Patient is status post median
 sternotomy. Heart is top-normal in size. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with secondary bronchovascular crowding. No overt pulmonary
 edema.  Obscuraion of the left hemidiaphragm likely atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.
