                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent onset of cough. Noted to have rales
 at lower lung fields bilat.  // CHF?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion, new bronchial wall thickening and scattered interstitial
 opacities with lower lung predominance. Minimal patchy opacities are also seen
 in both lung bases. No pleural effusion. Bones are diffusely demineralized,
 and a compression deformity is observed in the upper lumbar spine, present
 since ___ lateral chest radiograph.  Healed lateral right rib
 fractures are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings may be explained by congestive heart failure with interstitial edema,
 but differential diagnosis includes an atypical pneumonia. If the diagnosis is
 in doubt clinically, short-term followup radiographs after diuresis may be
 helpful.
