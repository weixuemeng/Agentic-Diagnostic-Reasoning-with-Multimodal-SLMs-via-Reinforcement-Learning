                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough dyspnea  // ro pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lungs appear
 hyperinflated which could reflect underlying COPD. A linear density in the
 left mid lung is likely a focus of scarring. No focal consolidation, effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. No convincing signs of edema. The heart is top-normal
 in size. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. Subtle suggestion of mitral
 annular calcification is noted. Bony structures appear intact though
 demineralized throughout.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD without superimposed pneumonia or CHF.
