                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest: Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o RCC (distant) // r/o metastasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___, CTA chest on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with chest radiograph on ___, there is no significant
 change.  Again seen are clips in the left hemithorax adjacent to healed
 left-sided rib fractures.  There is scarring at the lung bases and chronic
 blunting of the left hemidiaphragm, likely reflects pleural scarring.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There is no hilar lymphadenopathy.  Multilevel compression
 deformities in the thoracic spine are similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of metastatic disease in the thorax.  Please note
 that CT would be more sensitive for the detection of metastatic disease.
