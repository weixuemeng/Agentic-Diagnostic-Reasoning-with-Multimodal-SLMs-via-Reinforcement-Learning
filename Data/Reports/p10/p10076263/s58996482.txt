                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate collapse of the left lower lobe.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Bibasilar opacities are a combination
 of pleural effusions and atelectasis, larger on the left side.  The collapse
 of the left lower lobe is grossly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 are low lung volumes.  Residual contrast is seen in the colon.
