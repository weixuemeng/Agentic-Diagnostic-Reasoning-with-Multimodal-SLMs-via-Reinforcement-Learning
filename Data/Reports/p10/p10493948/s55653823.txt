                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p fall. head strike. L ___ digit pain.  Assess for
 fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated.  Retrocardiac opacity is present.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Left heart border is partially obscured. 
 Visualized cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Hila are normal.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.
 2.  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.
