                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mitral annular calcifications
 are noted.    The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild
 atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta noted.  Mild cephalization
 of the pulmonary vascular markings may suggest mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, similar compared to the previous exam.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is diffuse demineralization
 of the osseous structures with mild loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body which appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 similar compared to the previous exam.
