                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral views of the chest dated the ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, unchanged since the prior
 examination.  Again noted are mitral annular calcifications.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  Again noted is cephalization of the
 pulmonary vascular markings, suggesting stable, mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No focal consolidation or definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 The bones are diffusely demineralized.  Multilevel vertebral body height loss
 is noted in the midthoracic spine, which are age-indeterminate.  There is
 exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to the prior examinations.
 No definite consolidation.
