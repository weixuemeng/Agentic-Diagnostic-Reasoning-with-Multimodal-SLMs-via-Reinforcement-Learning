                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increased confusion.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Thoracic kyphosis is
 accentuated.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Increased pulmonary vascular
 markings are consistent with very mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 diffusely increased interstitial markings are consistent with chronic
 interstitial disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting minimal pulmonary vascular congestion although not
 necessarily changed from baseline.
 
 2.  No focal consolidation.
