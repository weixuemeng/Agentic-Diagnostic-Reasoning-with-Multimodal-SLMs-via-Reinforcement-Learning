 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable
 except for mild atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic arch.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear opacities in the left lung base
 likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  Multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine are present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.

 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
