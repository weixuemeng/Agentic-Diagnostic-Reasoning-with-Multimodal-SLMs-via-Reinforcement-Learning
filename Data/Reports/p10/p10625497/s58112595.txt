                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of COPD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart is
 borderline enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are stable. 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular
 markings is compatible with emphysema.  Patchy ill-defined bibasilar airspace
 opacities are more pronounced on the left, and are concerning for an
 infectious process.  Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on
 the lateral view likely reflects chronic pleural thickening rather than small
 pleural effusions.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is
 present with mild loss of height of several mid and lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are concerning for an infectious process. 
 Emphysema.
