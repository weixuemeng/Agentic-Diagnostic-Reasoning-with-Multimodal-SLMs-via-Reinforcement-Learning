                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma with known left-sided rib fractures and small left
 pneumothorax for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and CT torso from the same day.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again noted are multiple left-sided rib fractures.  There is no evidence of a
 large pneumothorax but a small persistent left-sided pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded.  There is no shift of the midline structures. There are slightly
 increased opacities in the left lung, likely suggestive of atelectasis. 
 Cardiac silhouette appears prominent.  No pleural effusion is identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Again noted are multiple slightly displaced left lower rib fractures. 
 There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax or shift of the midline
 structures, but a small persistent pneumothorax cannot be excluded. 
 
 2.  Increased opacities in the left lung which are likely representative of
 atelectasis.  Continued followup is recommended.
