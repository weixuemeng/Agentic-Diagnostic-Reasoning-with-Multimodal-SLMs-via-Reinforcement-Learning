                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // evaluate for pneumothorax s/p chest
 tube removal      evaluate for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___
 at 16:59
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central
 line, nasogastric tube, bibasilar chest tubes and mediastinal drains.  Lung
 volumes have diminished and there are patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater
 than right, which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be excluded. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours
 status post median sternotomy for CABG. No pneumothorax is seen, although the
 patient's position is not indicated on the current study and therefore the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax may be diminished especially if the
 patient was imaged in the supine or semi-erect position. Followup imaging is
 recommended. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt
 pulmonary edema.
