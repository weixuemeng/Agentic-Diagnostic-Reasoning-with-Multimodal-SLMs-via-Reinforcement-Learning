                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LUL wedge resection x3 and LLL wedge
 resection x1 // Please assess for PTX or other interval change s/p chest tube
 removal - please schedule for ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been interval
 removal of a left-sided chest tube, the small left apical pneumothorax is
 probably unchanged given differences in patient positioning, and there is a
 new area of hazy opacification projecting over the lateral mid left lung. 
 There is a band of right lower lobe atelectasis. There are probably small,
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged, small left apical pneumothorax.
 Left lung opacity may represent atelectasis or postoperative edema or
 hematoma.
