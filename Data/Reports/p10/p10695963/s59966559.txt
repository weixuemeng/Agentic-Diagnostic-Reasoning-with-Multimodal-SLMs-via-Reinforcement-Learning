                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic venous stasis and left
 lower extremity cellulitis with small left pleural effusion and decreased
 breath sounds on the left.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The heart size remains normal and no
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly prominent
 but without local contour abnormalities or advanced wall calcifications.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  As already identified on the preceding examination, there is a
 somewhat crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature in the left lower
 lobe area suggesting partial atelectasis, but no local discrete parenchymal
 infiltrate can be identified.  These findings persist although they have
 regressed slightly.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from
 any fluid accumulation as they were before.  Comparison is again extended to
 the previous examination of ___.  At that time, the left lung base
 was unremarkable.  The course of the described small atelectatic changes on
 the left base is unclear.  Possibility of pulmonary infarction related to
 pulmonary embolism can be entertained and would benefit from a chest CT
 examination.
