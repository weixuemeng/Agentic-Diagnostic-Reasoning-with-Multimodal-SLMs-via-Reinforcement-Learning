                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear lungs.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac apex and right ventricular
 outflow tract are slightly enlarged for a patient of this age.  Further
 correlation with this patient's symptoms of "dyspnea" would be helpful.  The
 hilar, mediastinal, and pleural contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
