                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after biventricular ICD
 placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the expected location of right
 atrium and right ventricle, and most likely left ventricle epicardial vein,
 with appearance as expected based on the desired location.  No break in the
 leads is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged in appearance including tortuosity of the descending aorta.  Lungs
 are essentially clear with no pleural effusion.
