                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE SUPINE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is low in position, terminating approximately 1
 cm above the level of the carina.  Recommend withdrawal by 3 to 5 cm for more
 optimal positioning.  OG tube is coiled in the mid esophagus.  The ED is aware
 of both of these findings at 10:40 p.m., and per the emergency department
 dashboard, adjustment of the endotracheal tube was made, and the OG tube was
 replaced.  There was mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Patchy medial
 right basilar opacity most likely relates to atelectasis, although a small
 amount of aspiration is not excluded.  Left lung is clear.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low-lying endotracheal tube.  Recommend withdrawal by approximately 3 to 5
 cm.
 
 2.  Orogastric tube coiled in the mid esophagus.
 
 The above findings were known by the emergency department at 10:40 p.m. on
 ___ and adjustments made per the ED dashboard.
