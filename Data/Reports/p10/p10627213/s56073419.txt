                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  NG tube placement, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 434.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  Interval extubation.  There is interval increase
 in size of bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar airspace
 opacities which may represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although an
 evolving pneumonia should also be considered.  No evidence of pneumothorax,
 although the left apex is obscured by the patient's mandible.  A nodular
 opacity projecting over the left fifth posterior rib may represent artifact as
 it was not previously present, but this can be assessed on followup imaging. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.
