 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent cardiac surgery, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 Previously demonstrated tiny right apical pneumothorax is not appreciated on
 the current exam. Patchy opacity in the left lung base appears slightly worse
 in the interval, with continued small bilateral pleural effusions. No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity appears slightly worse in the interval, suggestive
 of worsening atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, not substantially changed.  Previously noted tiny right
 apical pneumothorax appears resolved.
