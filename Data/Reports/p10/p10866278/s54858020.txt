                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, query pulmonary congestion, effusion or
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Despite improved inspiration compared to the most recent prior
 study, increased interstitial markings are indicative of worsening pulmonary
 edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are not worsened compared to prior. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain
 stable.  Again seen are multiple rib deformities consistent with old
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema with stable bilateral pleural
 effusions.
