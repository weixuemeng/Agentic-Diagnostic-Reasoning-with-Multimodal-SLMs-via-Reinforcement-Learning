                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath and weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is increased pulmonary edema, now severe.  Superimposed infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is seen which may be due to a small pleural effusion.
 There is a relatively rounded appearing opacity projecting along the right
 lung base which may relate to pat pulmonary edema although underlying
 consolidation or pulmonary lesion not excluded.  Left base retrocardiac
 opacity is seen is bb related to the atelectasis and severe pulmonary edema
 although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The hila are indistinct. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There are low lung volumes 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval significant increase in bilateral perihilar opacities concerning for
 severe pulmonary edema, superimposed infectious process is not excluded. 
 Relatively rounded opacity along the right lung base may relate to pulmonary
 edema however, consolidation due to infection or a pulmonary mass is not
 excluded.  Suggest repeat after diuresis. 
 
 Possible small right pleural effusion.
