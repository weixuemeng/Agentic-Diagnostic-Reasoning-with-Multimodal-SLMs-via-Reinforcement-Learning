                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral leg swelling, AFib with RVR.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low which exaggerates heart size and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to poor inspiratory
 effort.  There is central vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema. 
 Low lung volumes are associated with bibasilar atelectasis.  Multiple
 bilateral chronic rib fractures with callus formation are similar in
 appearance to prior study.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poor inspiratory effort with bibasilar atelectasis.  Vascular
 congestion with mild interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.
