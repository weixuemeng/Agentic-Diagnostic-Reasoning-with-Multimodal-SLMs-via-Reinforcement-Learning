                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure with desaturation  //
 evaluation
 ___ year old woman with resp failure and pneumothorax, changed pleuravac  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable AP radiographs of the chest from ___
 from 07:30 and 08:20.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The initial radiograph of 07:30 shows interval increase in the now moderate
 right pneumothorax despite the presence of a right apical pigtail catheter. 
 The ET tube ends at the level of the clavicles. The left IJ central venous
 catheter ends in lower SVC. Nasogastric tube coils in stomach.  Extensive
 bilateral airspace opacities are unchanged.
 
 The followup radiograph of ___ shows minimal decrease in the right
 pneumothorax with no other significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Latest radiograph shows slight interval decrease in moderate right
 pneumothorax with right apical pigtail catheter in place.
 
 Unchanged diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are likely due to severe
 pulmonary edema.
