                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, in a patient with a PleurX. Evaluate for
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates opacification of the left
 hemithorax, with minimally aerated lung is seen at the left apex.  This is
 consistent with increased severe left pleural effusion.  The right lung is
 clear, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The
 cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated secondary to overlying opacity in the
 left hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in the left pleural effusion, with near total opacification
 of the left hemithorax.  Minimally aerated lung is seen in the left lung apex.
