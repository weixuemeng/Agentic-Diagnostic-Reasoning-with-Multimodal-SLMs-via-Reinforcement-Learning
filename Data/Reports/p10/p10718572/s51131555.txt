                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT exam of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Enlargement of the
 central pulmonary arteries is suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with known emphysema on prior chest CT. 
 Additionally, there are worsening reticular opacities at the bases, which may
 reflect progressive interstitial fibrosis or interstitial edema superimposed
 upon fibrotic opacities.  A more confluent opacity has developed at the left
 lung base, predominantly in the retrocardiac region.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  Bones are demineralized, and there has been progression in
 severity of a compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine on the lateral
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Emphysema.
 
 2.  Progressive basilar interstitial abnormalities, which may represent
 pulmonary fibrosis with or without superimposed acute interstitial edema.
 
 3.  Confluent left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Followup radiographs are recommended to document resolution.
 
 4.  Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
