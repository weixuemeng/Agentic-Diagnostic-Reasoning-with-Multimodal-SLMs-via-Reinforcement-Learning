                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Increased opacities at the lung bases, with lack of
 visualization of the diaphragms.  This may be due to chronic process of the
 lung bases.  The diaphragm is not well seen likely due to patient's lordotic
 positioning.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 again noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited portable exam without definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  Consider PA and lateral when patient is amenable.
