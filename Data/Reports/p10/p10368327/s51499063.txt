                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, balance difficulties.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The aortic
 knob and descending thoracic aorta again demonstrates mild calcifications. 
 New hazy diffuse opacities are demonstrated in both lungs.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New diffuse hazy opacities in both lungs, likely reflective of mild pulmonary
 edema, although  an atypical infectious process cannot be completely excluded.
 Clinical correlation is recommended, and repeat radiographs after diuresis are
 recommended.
