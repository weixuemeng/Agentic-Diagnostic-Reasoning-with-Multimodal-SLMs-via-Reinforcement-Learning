                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p RIJ CVL  // placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of ___ at 08:41.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central catheter terminates in the upper SVC or at the junction of
 the SVC and brachiocephalic vein. There is persistent moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are likely
 either redistributed or slightly increased with fluid now extending superiorly
 to the lung apices. Bibasilar opacities persist, likely representing
 atelectasis though infection cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter terminates in the upper SVC or at the SVC/brachiocephalic
 vein junction.
 
 2. Pleural effusions have either redistributed or slightly increased.
 
 3. Pulmonary edema, similar to prior.
