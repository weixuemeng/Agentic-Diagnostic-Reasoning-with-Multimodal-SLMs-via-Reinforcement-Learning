 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Pleural effusions are associated at each lung base
 with parenchymal opacities.  The size of the effusions is difficult to
 quantify, but most likely at least small-to-moderate with suspected associated
 atelectasis.  Lucency along the left lateral chest with vertical orientation
 suggests a skinfold rather than a pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 hazy with an interstitial abnormality, overall suggesting mild pulmonary
 edema, including thickening of the minor fissure.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pleural effusions with opacities probably attributable to atelectasis.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
