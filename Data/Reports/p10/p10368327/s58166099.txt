                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bilateral
 skin folds are seen.  There is a subtle patchy lateral right base opacity
 which could be due to a small focus of infection.  The remainder of the lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal
 contours are similar in appearance compared to the prior study.  A small focus
 of the opacity in the lateral right lung base could be due to a small focus of
 infection or possibly a nipple shadow.  Consider repeat with nipple markers
 for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small focus of the opacity in the lateral right lung base could
