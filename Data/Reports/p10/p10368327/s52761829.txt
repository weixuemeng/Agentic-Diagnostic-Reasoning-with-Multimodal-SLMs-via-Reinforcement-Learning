                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is demonstrated with small to moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely
 excluded. There remains mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with small to moderate size bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.
