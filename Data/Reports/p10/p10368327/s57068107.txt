                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Right internal jugular venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction.  There is a marked increase in hazy opacification of
 each lung, suggesting pulmonary edema in addition to layering pleural
 effusions, probably at least moderate in size on the right and also likely
 substantial on the left.  Retrocardiac opacification is not specific, but
 would commonly be due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked worsening of pulmonary edema.  Right internal jugular
 catheters terminating at the cavoatrial junction; no evidence of pneumothorax.
