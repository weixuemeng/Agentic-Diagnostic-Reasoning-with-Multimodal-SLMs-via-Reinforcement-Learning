                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pna VS. chf on portable CXR  // eval for
 intervl change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no significant interval change since the prior study. There is
 moderate to severe pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left. Overall, lung volumes are low. Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis but again, infection
 can not be entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
