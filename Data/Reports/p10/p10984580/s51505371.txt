                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular predominance is re- demonstrated. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in configuration.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal streaky opacities in the left lower lobe
 are compatible with atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heterotopic ossification about the mid and distal left
 clavicle are again noted along with a chronic type 3 left AC joint separation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis.
