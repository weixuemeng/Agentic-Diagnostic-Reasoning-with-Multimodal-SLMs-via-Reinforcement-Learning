                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  Poor visualization of the left hemidiaphragm on the frontal
 projections may relate to a prominent epicardial fat pad.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  No
 pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
