                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic prostate cancer, chemotherapy, cough and
 temperature to ___.3, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Port-A-Cath
 resides over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending into the
 superior vena cava.  Linear densities within both lungs are most compatible
 with atelectasis, though the possibility of early pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral linear streaky opacities most compatible with
 atelectasis, though cannot exclude an early pneumonia.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
