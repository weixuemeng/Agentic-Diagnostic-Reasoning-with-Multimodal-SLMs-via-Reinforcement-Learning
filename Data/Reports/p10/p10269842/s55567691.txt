                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Scarring within the lung apices is present.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Streaky
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Partially imaged is a left
 humeral head prosthesis.  Ossific densities in the right shoulder joint likely
 reflect loose bodies.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine with degenerative
 changes is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
