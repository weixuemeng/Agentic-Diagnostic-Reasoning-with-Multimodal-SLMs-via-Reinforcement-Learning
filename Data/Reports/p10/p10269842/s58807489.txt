                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent from ___ at 10:18 a.m., and a series of
 older studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates no marked change
 from yesterday's study.  Again seen are bilateral lower lobe and lingular
 consolidation with superimposed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.  Given
 the location, aspiration etiology should be considered.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A feeding tube
 courses into the stomach and the side port appears to be beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Left shoulder arthroplasty hardware appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Stable multifocal pneumonia involving the bilateral lower lobes and the
 lingula, concerning for aspiration etiology given location. 
 2. Superimposed mild congestive heart failure, with no marked change since
 yesterday.
