 subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base, the lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is
 mild scarring within the lung apices. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is re- demonstrated. Compression deformity of a low thoracic
