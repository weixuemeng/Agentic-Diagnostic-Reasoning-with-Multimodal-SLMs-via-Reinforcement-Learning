                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 and there is bibasilar atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities most likely relate to
 atelectasis, although an early infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting mild pulmonary edema which may be accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 there may be a trace right pleural effusion.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen bilaterally.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities most likely relate to atelectasis in this patient with
 low lung volumes and mildly elevated right hemidiaphragm, however, underlying
 infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may suggest mild pulmonary
 edema which may be in part accentuated by low lung volumes.
 3.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
