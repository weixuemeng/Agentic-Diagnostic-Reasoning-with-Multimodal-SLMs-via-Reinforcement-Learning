                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and history of lung
 cancer status post mediastinoscopy, assess heart and lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Two views were obtained of the chest revealing intervally developed right
 pleural effusion and basal opacity and most likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 Retrocardiac aeration has improved with persistent demonstration of left mid
 to lower lung opacity corresponding to a left lower lobe mass on the lateral
 view.  Cardiac size is top normal as before.  Prominent interstitial markings,
 more pronounced on the left than the right, are likely reflective of
 underlying emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small right pleural effusion accompanying likely atelectasis
 with unchanged appearance of left lung mass.
