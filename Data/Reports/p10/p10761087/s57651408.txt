                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post thoracentesis for right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Evaluation for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 study, there has been interval decrease in the previously seen right pleural
 effusion, which also allows visualization of what appears to be an enlarged
 right hilus.  There is no pneumothorax, focal pneumonia or significant
 pulmonary edema.  The previously demonstrated left mid lung mass is again seen
 on this study.  The heart is top normal in size.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval decrease in the right pleural effusion with no
 associated pneumothorax.  Right hilar enlargement with no evidence of
 significant pulmonary edema.  Left mid lung mass is unchanged.
