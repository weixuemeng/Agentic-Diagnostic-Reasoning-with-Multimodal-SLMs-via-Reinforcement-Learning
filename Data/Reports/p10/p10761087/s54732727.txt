                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion common status post thoracentesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:  ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The previously noted small right pleural effusion has decreased in size
 compared to the prior exam with only a trace amount of residual fluid noted. 
 Adjacent atelectasis in the right lower lobe is re- demonstrated, but
 improved.  No definite pneumothorax is detected.  Remainder of the chest is
 unchanged.  Left lower lobe mass is again noted.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Hyperinflation of lungs with attenuation of the
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Decreased size of small right pleural effusion which is now trace, with no
 pneumothorax detected.
