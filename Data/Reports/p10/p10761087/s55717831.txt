                                 FINAL REPORT
 RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  PET-CT from ___ is also
 available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  Left
 perihilar mass is difficult to directly compare with prior imaging but
 persists as a retrocardiac finding and seems to have decreased with appearance
 of cavitation.  Streaky basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis.  The
 chest is hyperinflated.  Trace pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute disease.  Suspected decrease in left perihilar
 mass with new cavitation although comparison with cross-sectional imaging is
 suggested for oncological surveillance if more detail is needed clinically.
