                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bike accident.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A 1.2 cm well-circumscribed opacity
 projects over the left heart border but disappears upon patient repositioning.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no displaced rib
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process or displaced rib fracture.  A
 dedicated rib series with obliques is more sensitive for rib fracture.
