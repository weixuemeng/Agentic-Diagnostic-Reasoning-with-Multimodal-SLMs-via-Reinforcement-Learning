                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent stroke-like symptoms and shortness of
 breath over several weeks.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are linear
 opacities suggested at the upper lungs bilaterally with retraction of the hila
 suggestive of chronic underlying disease.  There is suggestion of a focal
 rounded opacity projecting over the anterior aspects of the lower thoracic
 spine on the lateral view and potentially abutting the lateral aspect of the
 descending thoracic aorta in the retrocardiac region.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear and there is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Proximal left humeral hardware is identified.  Diffuse osteopenia is
 also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Subtle rounded
 opacity projecting over the lower lobe, potentially on the left.  This could
 potentially due to superimposed shadows of degenerative changes in the spine
 and the adjacent aorta; however, non-urgent chest CT is suggested to exclude
 underlying mass or thoracic aortic abnormality.
