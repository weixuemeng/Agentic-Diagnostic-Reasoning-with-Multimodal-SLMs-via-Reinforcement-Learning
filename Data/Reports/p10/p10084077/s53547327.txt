                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 much poorer inspiration, which most likely accounts for the increased
 prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There are atelectatic
 changes at the bases, especially on the left with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle, though this appears to reflect pleural thickening rather than effusion
 on the lateral view.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 Of incidental note is residual contrast material in the colon, related to a
 recent CT scan.
