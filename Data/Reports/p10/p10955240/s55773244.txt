                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with alcoholic hepatitis. Has tachycardia and
 decreased b/l breath sounds.  // ? source of decreased b/l breath sounds
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Artifact from the patient's hair overlies the right left lung apices. 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.
 
 Probable mild cardiomegaly.   There is bibasilar atelectasis with small
 bilateral effusions.  No definite consolidation or infectious infiltrate.  The
 mid and upper zones are grossly clear, without infiltrate.  The apices, as
 noted, are obscured by overlapping artifact.
 
 There are calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, suggesting prior
 granulomatous disease.  At the right base laterally, there is a small focal
 irregularity, which may simply be artifact due to fluid and atelectasis. 
 However a focal pulmonary nodule, possibly a calcified granuloma, might also
 account for this appearance.
 
 Mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Although an infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis cannot be
 entirely excluded, the appearance is more suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation.  Bilateral apices are
 partially obscured.
 
 Probable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, consistent with prior
 granulomatous disease.
 
 Small focal density at the right base laterally is partially obscured by
 surrounding effusion and atelectasis.  Attention to this area on followup
 films is recommended to exclude a focal nodule or  calcified granuloma.
 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Small focal density at the right base laterally is partially
 obscured by surrounding effusion and atelectasis. Attention to this area on
 followup films is recommended to exclude a focal nodule or calcified
 granuloma.
