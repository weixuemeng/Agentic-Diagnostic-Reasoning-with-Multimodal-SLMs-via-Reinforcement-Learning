                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with CHF and altered mental status and shortness of
 breath for three days.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Again seen is relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunting of the right lateral
 costophrenic angle, potentially due to small effusion.  The lungs are clear of
 consolidation.  Low lung volumes result in crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but this is likely due to low
 lung volumes and portable technique and is likely unchanged from prior. 
 Degenerative changes are seen at the left shoulder.  Surgical clips in the
 right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Persistent right
 effusion/atelectasis.
