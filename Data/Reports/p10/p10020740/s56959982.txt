                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatitis and catatonia, question sign of a new
 consolidation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 A mask is in place and, together with the patient's chin, overlies the upper
 chest, obscuring it to some degree.  There are low inspiratory volumes, with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Allowing for this, no focal consolidation or gross
 effusion is identified.  Possible small amount of fluid at the right base,
 similar to the prior study, but the right costophrenic angle is excluded from
 the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for technical differences and partial obscuration of the
 upper chest, I doubt significant change compared with one day earlier.
