                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Catatonia, on tube feeds, recent intubation, now fevers.  Rule out
 pneumonia, acute process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:01 a.m.
 
 The ET tube is not visualized and has apparently been removed.  An NG tube is
 present, tip overlying gastric fundus.  A side port, if present, may lies in
 the region of the GE junction.  A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip
 over proximal SVC.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with atelectasis at the right and left
 bases.  This has increased slightly compared with the prior film. No frank
 consolidation is detected. There is probably a small right pleural effusion,
 not definitely changed.  Doubt CHF.    Mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight interval worsening of bibasilar atelectasis.  Small right effusion is
 probably unchanged.  Low inspiratory volumes persist.  
 
 No definite pneumonic infiltrate is detected, but the possibility of a subtle
 early infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
