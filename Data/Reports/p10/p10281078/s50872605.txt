                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SpO2 ___% on 3L.  // ?reason for desats
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, lower lung volumes accentuate the
 cardiomediastinal contours and result in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  Interval worsening of multifocal the linear and patchy opacities
 in the mid and lower lungs, most likely due to atelectasis although coexisting
 infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
