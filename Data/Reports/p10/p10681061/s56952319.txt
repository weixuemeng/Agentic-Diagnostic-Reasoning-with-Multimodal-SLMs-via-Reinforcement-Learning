                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure secondary to CHF,
 influenza, and pneumonia intubated and sedated  // evaluate pulmonary edema   
 evaluate pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, as is
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with substantial volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.  Continued mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  The area
 of increased opacification in the right upper zone continues to decrease,
 consistent with clearing aspiration.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed consolidation would be very difficult to exclude,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
