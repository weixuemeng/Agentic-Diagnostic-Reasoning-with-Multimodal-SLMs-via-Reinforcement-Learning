 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:05 PM
  ET tube 3.3 cm from the carina. Left central line terminating in the low SVC.
  Stable bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased overall density of the right
  lung may be secondary to increased layering pleural fluid as patient is
  rotated to that side.  Alveolar opacities persist bilaterally wtih some slight
  improved aeration of the left lung apex. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thrombectomy with pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is haziness of the
 right hemithorax consistent with substantial layering pleural effusion. 
 Smaller degree of effusion on the left.  Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is
 again consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure in a patient
 with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
