                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shock, central venous access line changed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:57 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the central venous access
 line has been pulled back.  The tip of the line currently projects over the
 lower SVC.
 
 Otherwise, the right pleural effusion appears to have minimally decreased, but
 the remaining radiographic appearance is unchanged.
