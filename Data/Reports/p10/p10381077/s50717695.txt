                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and cardiac history with fevers
 and wheezing, question edema versus pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There continues to be an asymmetric predominantly interstitial abnormality,
 left greater than right, which is slightly more pronounced and therefore still
 more likely represents asymmetric edema, although an atypical infectious
 process could also have this appearance.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No
 large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies.
