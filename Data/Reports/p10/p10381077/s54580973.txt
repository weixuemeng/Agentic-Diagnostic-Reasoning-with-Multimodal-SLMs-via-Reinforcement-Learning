                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, nausea, and vomiting.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There diffuse interstitial opacities in the left lung with a nearly
 normal appearance of the right lung.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is a tortuous aorta with some atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic knob.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asymmetric interstitial opacities may be due to asymmetric edema,
 infection or aspiration given history of vomitting. Follow up with chest
 radiographs recommended after treatment.
