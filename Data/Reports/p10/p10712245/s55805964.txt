                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There are prominent and indistinct central pulmonary
 vessels worrisome for fluid overload, and potentially there is a developing
 opacity in the medial right lower lung, probably within the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting a mild congestive heart failure or fluid
 overload and the possibility of a developing focal opacity at the right lung
 base should also be considered in short-term follow-up depending on clinical
 presentation.
