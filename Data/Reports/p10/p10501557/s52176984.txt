                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hepatic decompensation, and recent CXR
 ___ ___ showed bibasal opacities and left pleural effusion.  // Please
 evaluate for interval change. Please have patient take full inspiration, as
 previous CXR did not show good inspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  An azygos fissure, normal variant, is re-
 demonstrated in the right upper hemithorax.  Small left pleural effusion is
 overall unchanged.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle with silhouetting
 of the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm may reflect a combination of
 moderate atelectasis and elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No definite right
 pleural effusion, and if present, is minimal/trace.  Appearance of the heart
 and mediastinum are unchanged.  No frank pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Moderate right lung atelectasis.
 3.  No pneumonia.
