 HISTORY:  Mental status changes.  Question chest abnormality.
 
 REFERENCE EXAMINATION:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is bibasilar atelectasis.  A small infectious infiltrate
 at either base cannot be totally excluded; however, the overall appearance is
 similar to that from one week prior.  The upper lungs are clear.  The aorta is
 tortuous, unchanged.  There continues to be mild cardiomegaly.
