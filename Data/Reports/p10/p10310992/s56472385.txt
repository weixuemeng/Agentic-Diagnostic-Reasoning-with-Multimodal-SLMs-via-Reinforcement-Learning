                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bibasilar crackles, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiomediastinum is
 unremarkable.  The heart size is normal.  There is bibasilar atelectasis. 
 There are no pleural effusions or findings to suggest pulmonary edema.  There
 is no large consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Within the right lower
 lung, more visible on the frontal view, is a 7-mm rounded opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  7-mm nodular opacity at the right lung base may represent superimposition
 of structures; however, non-emergent oblique views are recommended to
 ascertain if this finding is a true pulmonary nodule.
 2.  No pulmonary edema.
