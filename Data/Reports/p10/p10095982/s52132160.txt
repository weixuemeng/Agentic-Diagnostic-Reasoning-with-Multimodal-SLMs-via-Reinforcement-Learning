                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent (above-baseline) O2 requirement
 and cough.  // Pls eval for interval change of lung findings seen on admission
 (PNA vs atelectasis?).     Pls eval for interval change of lung findings seen
 on admiss
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to plain radiographs dated ___ at 15:00 and ___ at 21:39 and selected images of the chest CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 14:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There is a small
 right basilar and lateral pleural effusion. The overall interstitium is
 somewhat prominent, particularly in the right mid and lower lung, but this
 does not appear to be significantly changed since ___.  Given that the
 left lung appears grossly clear, this more likely represents an infectious
 process rather than edema.  Clinical correlation, however, is advised. No
 pneumothorax.
