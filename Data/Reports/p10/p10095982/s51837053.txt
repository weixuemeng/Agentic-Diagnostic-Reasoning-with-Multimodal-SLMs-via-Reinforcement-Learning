                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and chest pain.  History of empyema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. A
 pigtail catheter projects over the posterior base of the right side chest. ,
 its exact location uncertain. There is a small pleural effusion, partly
 loculated. This includes pleural thickening along the lateral side of the
 chest are. Although these findings are new of air in not necessarily acute and
 in the setting on chronicity of patchy new opacities in the right middle lobe
 and lingula is uncertain. Interstitium is mildly prominent throughout each
 lung which suggests are mild vascular congestion, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild interstitial process most suggestive of vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Small loculated pleural effusion on the right with patchy densities which
 may be due to coinciding atelectasis. Although no recent prior radiographs are
 available, some of this appearance may be subacute or more chronic, although
 recent or ongoing infectious process is not excluded.
 
 3.  Pigtail catheter posterior along the posterior base of the chest; its
 exact location with respect to the diaphragm is not well delineated by the
 radiographs but it is compatible with pleural placement.
