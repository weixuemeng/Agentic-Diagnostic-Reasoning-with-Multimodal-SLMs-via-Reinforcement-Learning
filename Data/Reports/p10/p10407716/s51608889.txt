                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with atrial fibrillation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  New when compared to prior is an ll defined
 left basilar opacity, not as clearly seen on the lateral exam.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in configuration.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left basilar opacity, better seen on the frontal than on
 the lateral could be due to atelectasis; however, developing infiltrate is
 also possible.  Clinical correlation suggested.
