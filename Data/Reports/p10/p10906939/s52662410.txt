 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheobronchoplasty, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Moderate cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion and areas of
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  The radiodensity of the lung parenchyma
 has improved, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  In the retrocardiac
 lung areas, some atelectatic foci persist.
