                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with b/l MRSA PNA now with pain on left lower,
 lateral ribcage. Pain with palpation on exam. Pain when turned onto left side.
 // rib fracture around midaxillary line on left lower rib? also eval of
 consolidations
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute, displaced rib fracture is evident on this chest radiograph, but note
 that portable chest radiographs are relatively insensitive for detecting
 nondisplaced fractures. As compared to recent radiograph from earlier the same
 date, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. Small right
 and moderate left pleural effusions have increased in size with associated
 worsening bibasilar opacities. No substantial change in right upper lobe
 consolidation.
