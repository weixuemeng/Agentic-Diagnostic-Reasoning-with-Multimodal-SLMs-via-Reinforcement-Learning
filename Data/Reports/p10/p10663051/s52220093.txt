                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:47 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypotension after an open left decortication.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Small left pneumothorax is slightly larger.  There is no mediastinal shift to
 suggest developing tension.  Undulating contour in the left hemithorax,
 probably atelectatic left lower lobe is more pronounced today than yesterday. 
 I do not see a large fluid collection in the left chest to suggest hemothorax.
 Right lung is clear.  Heart size normal.  Left apical and basal pleural tubes
 unchanged in their positions.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall
 and left neck is stable as well.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal
 contour.
