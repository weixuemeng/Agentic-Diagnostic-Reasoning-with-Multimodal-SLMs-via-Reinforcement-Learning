                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with alcohol withdrawal seizures status post
 intubation, now with cough and right-sided pain with inspiration, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The heart appears to be normal in
 size and configuration.  The trachea is midline and cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  There is slightly more crowding within the right
 central pulmonary vessels on this study as compared to the prior examination;
 however, this is likely due to the fact that in the current study the
 inspiratory effort is not as full.  There is a small opacity seen overlying
 the heart on the lateral radiograph, which appears to be stable from the prior
 study.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval changes or evidence of pneumonia
