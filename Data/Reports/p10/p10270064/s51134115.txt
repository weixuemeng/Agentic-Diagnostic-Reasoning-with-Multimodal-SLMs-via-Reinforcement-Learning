 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 12:19 PM
  1.  Endotracheal tube 3 cm above the carina.
  2.  Lung expansion is adequate.
  3.  More prominent right lower lung atelectasis.
  4.  A redundant loop of nasogastric tube is possibly kinked within the stomach
  and should be retracted to straighten it if indicated.
  5.  Unidentified new line, likely external to the patient, overlying the neck.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate ETT placement, lung expansion, consolidation in a
 patient with brainstem CVA.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 SEMIUPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is again
 seen approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian central venous
 catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in the mid to low SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube is within the stomach but contains a hairpin turn which may
 cause kinking.  The tip is likely in the antrum.  An unidentified additional
 line with a radiopaque cylinder overlies the neck adjacent to the endotracheal
 and nasogastric tubes, and was not present on the prior radiograph.  It is
 likely external to the patient.  
 
 An area of linear atelectasis in the right lower lung is more prominent than
 on the prior study.  The well-expanded lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The patient has had a past
 wedge resection of the right lung.
