                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old s/p ___'s end colostomy for perforation.  HIV and
 toxoplasmosis.  Last CD4 count 4.  // Concern for PNA, CAP v. PCP     ___
 for PNA, CAP v. PCP
 
 ___:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality has improved in the
 upper lungs, still present in the left perihilar and both basal regions. 
 Particularly on the left there is coalescent consolidation in the lower lobe. 
 Given the change over 24 hr, this could be due to improving edema or
 decreasing pulmonary infection.  The heart is not large, mediastinal and
 pulmonary vasculature are not  engorged and there is no appreciable pleural
 effusion, so interstitial pneumonia becomes more likely, including virus and
 PJP.
 
 Pneumoperitoneum is no larger today than it was yesterday, but the explanation
 is not apparent.
