 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AIDS, multiple OI's, septic with tachypnea
 to ___.  // interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with
 increased distension of the azygos vein, reflecting increased intravascular
 volume.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 well-expanded.  Nodular opacities primarily at the lung bases bilaterally have
 progressed, especially in the left lung, consistent with an infectious
 process.  There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular venous
 catheter.  The Dobhoff tube remains in stable position terminating at the
 pylorus.  The upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval significant worsening of nodular opacities bilaterally, especially in
 the left lung, most consistent with an infectious process.This may represent
 PCP, although the progression is more rapid than expected.  Viral pneumonia is
 also a possibility.
