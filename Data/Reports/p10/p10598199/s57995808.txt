                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lower chest wall pain status post blunt injury, here to
 evaluate for displaced rib fracture, pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the inspiratory lung volumes are greatly decreased from the
 prior study, increased opacification of the lower lungs is probably
 atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. The pleural space is probably normal.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no pulmonary edema. 
 Cardiac size is exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Within this limitation,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged from the prior study. 
 The trachea is midline.  There are no displaced rib fractures, but since the
 conventional chest radiograph
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 
 2.  No displaced rib fracture.  Since conventional chest radiographs are not a
 sensitive modality for the evaluation of chest cage injury. Detail views in
 areas of clinical concern would be more fruitful.
 
 3.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
