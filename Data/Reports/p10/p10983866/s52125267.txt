 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___, chest CTs from
 ___ through ___ and abdominal CT from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 Sternal wires and mediastinal clips denote prior cardiac surgery.  The heart
 size is top normal.  Widespread coarse reticular opacities are increased since
 the ___ radiograph, particularly at the bases, verified via direct
 comparison between the abdominal CT examination performed this evening and a
 chest CT from ___, reflecting progressive interstitial lung disease in
 the setting of severe emphysema.  
 
 Bilateral upper zone calcified nodules are also seen on the CT from ___,
 likely the sequela of granulomatous disease.  
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of coarse reticular widespread opacities reflective
 of worsening interstitial lung disease in the setting of severe emphysema.  No
 superimposed acute process detected.
