                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lower lobe opacity has worsened since the recent radiograph
 and could reflect an evolving pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this
 entity.  Newly developed right lower lobe opacity could reflect additional
 site of infection or, alternatively, focal aspiration or atelectasis. 
 Allowing for relatively low lung volumes, exam is otherwise unchanged with
 persistent bilateral upper lobe bullous disease with adjacent confluent areas
 of fibrosis and scarring accompanied by calcified granulomas.
