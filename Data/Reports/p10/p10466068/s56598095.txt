                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset afib s/p cervical spine
 laminectomy for spinal cord meningioma  // please eval for any acute
 cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is significantly rotated to the left in this study.  Within these
 limitations, there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary
 edema and moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Lungs are otherwise clear without
 focal consolidation.  A rounded soft tissue density projecting over the heart
 were may be consistent with a hiatal hernia, or less likely an aortic
 aneurysm.  In addition to thoracolumbar scoliosis, there are marked osteopenic
 and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  Note is made of a retrocardiac soft tissue abnormality possibly a
 hiatal hernia or less likely a thoracic aorta aneurysm.  Recommend follow-up
 PA and lateral chest radiographs for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend PA and lateral chest radiographs for further
 evaluation of the retrocardiac soft tissue abnormality.
