  Apparent retrocardiac air-fluid level may be within a hiatal hernia, but could

  edema is again noted.  No definite opacities to suggest pneumonia, however
  given the overlapping structures, CT could be performed for further
  evaluation, if clinically indicated.  --___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with delirium and worsening wbc.  // r/o acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is a stable.  Retrocardiac opacities most likely correspond
 to a hiatal hernia.  Several punctate dens nodules throughout the lungs could
 represent calcified granulomas.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Left effusion is small.  .  The aorta is tortuous
 Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are mild
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild vascular congestion
 Probably calcified granulomas
 Hiatal hernia
