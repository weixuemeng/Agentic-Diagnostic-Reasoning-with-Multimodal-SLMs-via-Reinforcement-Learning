                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with alcoholism and HCV cirrhosis after right IJ
 removal.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Subsegmental atelectasis is
 responsible for unusual contours at the base of the right lung but not pleural
 air.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  Transvenous right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator lead tip is in the apex of the right
 ventricle.  The proximal electrode spans the superior vena cava and upper
 right atrium.  Ascending thoracic aorta is tortuous or dilated.  Small hiatus
 hernia is noted.  The proximal left humerus is severely eroded or involved
 with an osteolytic process.  Clinical correlation recommended, should be
 supplemented by conventional radiographs of this region.
