                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain.  Patient with history of lung cancer.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Aside from the near atelectasis in
 the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region, the lungs are clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The aorta is tortuous.  The AP window is
 obliterated.  This is of unknown chronicity and etiology.  If recent CT chest
 has not been performed, is recommended.  If prior radiographs become
 available, this will be helpful for comparison.
