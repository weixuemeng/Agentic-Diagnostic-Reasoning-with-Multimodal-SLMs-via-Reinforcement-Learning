                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Poorly
 defined left retrocardiac opacity is somewhat less conspicuous compared with
 the prior exam.  Findings could reflect atelectasis or chronic aspiration. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased conspicuity of left lower lobe opacity which could
 reflect chronic aspiration/atelectasis.
