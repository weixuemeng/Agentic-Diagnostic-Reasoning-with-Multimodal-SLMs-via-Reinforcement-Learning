                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fatigue, long smoking history.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The heart size is normal.  Prominence of ascending aorta is unchanged. 
 Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lung volumes are increased.  Substantial
 lucencies in both upper lungs with decreased architectural distortion are
 concerning for emphysema.  No definitive nodules are demonstrated, but there
 is a potentially confluence of pulmonary vessels in the right lower lung
 versus a pulmonary nodule, which should be further assessed.  Thus, anterior
 oblique views are recommended.  Alternatively, chest CT might be another
 option to consider giving smoking history present.
