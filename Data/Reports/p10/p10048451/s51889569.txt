                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible right base nodule.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, frontal and lateral views fail to
 show the right basilar opacification.  Multiple vessels in the region suggest
 that this represented merely a fortuitous combination of shadows.
 
 There is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Paucity of vessels in
 the upper zones is consistent with emphysema.
