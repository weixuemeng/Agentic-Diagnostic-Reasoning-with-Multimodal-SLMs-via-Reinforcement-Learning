                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath and pulmonary fibrosis, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuous aorta and normal
 cardiac size.  Extensive bilateral lower lobe predominant interstitial
 abnormalities, right greater than left, are unchanged from prior study.  There
 are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable findings compatible with pulmonary fibrosis.  Of note, the
 more confluent areas previously seen in the right middle lobe, lingula, and
 right upper lobe are stable.
