                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are again noted with diffuse increased interstitial opacities
 compatible with patient's known history of pulmonary fibrosis.  There are,
 however, new more confluent regions of opacity in the right mid-to-upper lung
 and potentially the left lung base as well.  There is no effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacities in the right mid-to-upper lung and
 potentially left lung base, superimposed on chronic lung disease compatible
 with patient's known pulmonary fibrosis.  Findings could represent
 superimposed asymmetric edema versus infection.
