                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CTA of the chest of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse coarse interstitial reticular opacities are again
 demonstrated, consistent with widespread pulmonary fibrosis.  Although
 diffusely distributed, this relatively spares the apices.  Slightly more
 confluent opacities are present within the right middle lobe and lingular
 regions, partially obscuring both heart borders.  Additionally, a somewhat
 nodular opacity projects over the right third anterior rib level. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with normal heart size and
 pulmonary vascularity.  No pleural effusion.  Diffuse bone demineralization
 and thoracic spine compression deformities are unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary fibrosis, with no superimposed findings to suggest clinically
 suspected congestive heart failure.  Given the diffuse distribution and
 presence of coexisting air trapping on prior CT of ___, chronic
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis should be considered as a potential etiology.
 
 2.  Slightly more confluent opacities in right middle lobe and lingula as well
 as a nodular opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect confluent areas of
 fibrosis, but superimposed infection should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  
 
 Followup radiographs may be helpful after antibiotic therapy if warranted
 clinnically, as entered into the radiology communications dashboard on ___.  If the nodular opacity in the right upper lobe persists on follow up
 CXR, CT may be considered to exclude a lung nodule.
