 asymmetric right mid and upper lung and left lower lung opacities.  Right
 lower lung opacity has increased since the prior exam.  No substantial pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.

 Increased right lower lung opacity with pre-existing right upper and left
 lower lung opacities, superimposed on background pulmonary fibrosis.
