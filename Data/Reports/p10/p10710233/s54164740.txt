                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unwitnessed fall and spinal tenderness.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and concurrent chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal radiograph of the chest the mediastinum is shifted to the right
 with opacification along the right heart border likely representing volume
 loss in the left lower lobe and middle lobe related to atelectasis.  There is
 a moderate right pleural effusion.  Opacity at right base could represent a
 combination of atelectasis effusion.  There is a convex border to the left
 mediastinum reflecting the opacity seen on CT in the left lower lobe
 consistent with  rounded atelectasis.  No left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion with volume loss in the right lower and middle
 lobes and opacity at the right base and left lower lung (better seen on CT)
 likely atelectasis.
