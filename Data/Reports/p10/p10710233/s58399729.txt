                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, left eye hematoma.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is moderately enlarged.  The aorta remains diffusely calcified and
 markedly tortuous.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild atelectatic
 changes are noted within the lung bases.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 device is seen with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 There is no displaced fracture identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
