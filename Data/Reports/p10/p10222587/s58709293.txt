                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p intubation with SAH  // confirm tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior outside radiograph from 00:40 on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 3.7 cm above the level the
 carina. Enteric tube courses through the esophagus, below the diaphragm, an
 out of view.
 
 The lung volumes are low, accentuating heart size, which is top-normal, and
 crowding of pulmonary vascular structures which may be mildly congested.  No
 pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation is seen. The left
 costophrenic sulcus is not visualized, possibly due to atelectasis and
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Monitoring and support devices in appropriate position.  Low lung volumes with
 mild vascular congestion and possible small left pleural effusion.
