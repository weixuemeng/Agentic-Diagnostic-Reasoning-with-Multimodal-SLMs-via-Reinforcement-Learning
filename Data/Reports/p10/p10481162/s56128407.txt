                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  SVT, history of metastatic breast cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the
 prior study, there has been significant interval increase in left hemithorax
 opacity which involves the left mid and lower lung fields, which may be
 related to underlying metastatic disease with possible superimposed
 infection/pleural effusion.  Mulitple pulmonary nodules are again seen. Patchy
 right base opacity is also seen, which could be due to infection and/or
 progression of metastatic disease.  The cardiac silhouette is not well
 assessed due to the left-sided opacity.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
