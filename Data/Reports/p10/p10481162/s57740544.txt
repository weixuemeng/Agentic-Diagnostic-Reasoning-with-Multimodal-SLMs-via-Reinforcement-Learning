                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent pleural effusion status post thoracocentesis, assess
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, there is dense lobulated opacification
 projecting over the left lower lungs, possibly representing collapse
 associated with a loculated pleural effusion; however, infiltrative malignancy
 is not excluded adjacent to dense upper mediastinal opacification likely
 correlating with large anterior soft tissue mass.  A small loculated effusion
 within the pleural fissure is a less likely possibility.  Right lung is clear.
 Stable severe cardiomegaly identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lobulated opacification projecting over left lower lung, 
 atelectasis and loculated pleural vs infiltrative mass.  Opacification
 projecting over the upper mediastinum and left upper lung likely relates to
 large anterior soft tissue tumor better evident on ___ CT.
