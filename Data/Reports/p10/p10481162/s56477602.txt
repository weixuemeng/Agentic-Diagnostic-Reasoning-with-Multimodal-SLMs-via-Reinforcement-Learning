                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest mass
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low
 lung volume with left pleural effusion and basal atelectasis noted.  Best seen
 on the lateral view is an extrapleural based opacity emerging from the chest
 wall, likely at the 2nd rib articulation with the sternum which is consistent
 with progression of the known chest wall metastatic lesion. Multiple bilateral
 pulmonary nodular opacities compatible with metastases are better seen on
 prior PET/CT. There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is top normal size, with
 otherwise normal cardiac and mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity at left second costosternal articulation is consistent
 with progression of left chest wall metastasis.  Muliple pulmonary nodules
 also again consistent with metastatic disease.
 
 2. Small to moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
