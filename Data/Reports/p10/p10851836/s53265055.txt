                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question congestive heart failure.  Patient on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the mid superior vena cava.  The heart
 is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is slight blunting of each costophrenic sulcus
 suggesting very small pleural effusions, more prominent on the left than
 right.  Patchy associated posterior basilar opacities are suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  A very mild interstitial abnormality is somewhat more prominent
 in the left lung than right, but is fairly diffuse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality, probably due to mild vascular
 congestion, although potentially explained by an inflammatory process such as
 atypical infection; very small suspected pleural effusions which would support
 the probability of vascular congestion.
