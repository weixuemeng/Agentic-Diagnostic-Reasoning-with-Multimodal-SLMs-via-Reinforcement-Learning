                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pancreatic cancer and biliary
 obstruction, now with question pulmonary edema versus pneumonia, increasing
 oxygen requirement, and leukocytosis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in place and unchanged in position.  Lungs
 demonstrate blunting of both costophrenic angles, likely reflecting small
 effusions, although chronic pleural thickening would also be in the
 differential.  The lungs are relatively low in volume.  Streaky opacities at
 both bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  However, there is
 a 1.2-cm focal nodule at the right apex.  In the absence of remote prior
 studies, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered, especially
 in light of the fact that the patient has a known malignancy.  This
 recommendation was conveyed to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on
 ___ at 11:28 a.m.
