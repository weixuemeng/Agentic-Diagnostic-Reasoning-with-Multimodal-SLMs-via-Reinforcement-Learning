                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was performed.  Again
 seen is chronic diffuse interstitial reticulation with bronchiectasis as
 previously described.  Increased opacification at the left lung base may
 represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  There are no
 suspicious osseous lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the left lung base may represent atelectasis,
 however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.
