                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cholecystectomy, fever, rule out infectious process.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the preoperative chest x-ray, bibasilar
 consolidations, left more than right, are seen.  The findings could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Unchanged moderate tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded.  No right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
