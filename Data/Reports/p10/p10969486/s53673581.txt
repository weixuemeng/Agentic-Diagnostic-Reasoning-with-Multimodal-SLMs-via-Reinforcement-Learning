                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man on methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis.  Has sore
 throat, cough, and fever.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated due to COPD.  Asbestos-related pleural plaques
 are responsible for the curvilinear opacity at the lateral aspect of the left
 mid lung as well as more subtle pleural contour abnormalities.  There are no
 focal lung lesions, specifically no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Heart
 size is normal and there is no indication of central lymph node enlargement.
