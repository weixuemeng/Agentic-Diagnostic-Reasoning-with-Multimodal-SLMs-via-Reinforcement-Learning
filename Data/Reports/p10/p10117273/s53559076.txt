 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:41 PM
  This study is underpenetrated, however given the limitations, there appears to
  be slightly increased air space opacity in the bilateral perihilar region
  which may represent slightly worsened pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia. Left
  lower lobe consolidation is slightly improved.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, PNA, intubated  // eval etiololgy
 of acute hypoxia (lobar collapse, pulm edema, new infiltrate      eval
 etiololgy of acute hypoxia (lobar collapse, pulm edema,
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe global pulmonary opacification which worsened progressively between
 ___ and ___ is probably unchanged, given slight increase in lung
 volumes.  Most likely diagnosis is pulmonary edema, though not necessarily
 cardiogenic even though mediastinal venous engorgement suggests increased
 central venous pressure or volume.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is a possibility.
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Pleural effusion is presumed but not large.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 Nasogastric tube is looped in the hypopharynx and then passes into the stomach
 and out of view.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends
 in the right atrium.
