                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man presenting with GIB s/p fluid resuscitation, now
 with hypoxia  // eval for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have improved,
 reflecting better ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures.  However,
 the extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, predominating in the mid
 and lower lung zones, are constant.  Moderate atelectasis in the retrocardiac
 lung regions and at the lung bases.  No larger pleural effusions. The position
 of the endotracheal tube is constant.
