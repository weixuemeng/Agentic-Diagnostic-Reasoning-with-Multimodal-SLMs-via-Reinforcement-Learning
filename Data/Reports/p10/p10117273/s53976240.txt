                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis  // eval for intrathoracic process
 eval for intrathoracic process
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Anterior costal calcifications project over a region of possible peribronchial
 infiltration in the right lower lobe centrally, projecting lateral to the
 heart, is of uncertain chronicity.  It could be an early infection.  Any prior
 chest radiograph should be evaluated to see if this is a new finding
 warranting further investigation.  If there is none, I would recommend routine
 oblique views to confirm its appearance.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size normal.  Normal mediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural contours.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Prior radiograph should be obtained to evaluate possible
 right lower lobe lesion.  Oblique views would be useful if there is any
 question about its chronicity or its presence.  CT scanning may ultimately be
 necessary if oblique views are equivocal.
