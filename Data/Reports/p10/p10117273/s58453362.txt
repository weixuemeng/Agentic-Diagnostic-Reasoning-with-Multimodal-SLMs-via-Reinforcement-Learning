                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, now with GI bleed
 status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3.3 cm above the carina.  Coalescent, bilateral, perihilar
 opacities reflect alveolar edema.  Linear densities in the right mid and lower
 lung may reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests
 small, bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central alveolar edema and small, bilateral pleural effusions suggest volume
 overload.
