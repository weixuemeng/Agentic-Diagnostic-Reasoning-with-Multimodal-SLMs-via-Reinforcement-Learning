  2. Mild pulmonary edema.
  
  3. Severe compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body of unknown
  chronicity.  Correlate with focal tenderness.
  
  4. Apparent inferior subluxation of the right humeral head with respect to the

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cerebral palsy and weakness, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema as well as atelectasis at the left lung base.  There is
 asymmetric elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. 
 There is a severe compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body.  There is
 also apparent inferior subluxation of the right humeral head with respect to
 the glenoid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
