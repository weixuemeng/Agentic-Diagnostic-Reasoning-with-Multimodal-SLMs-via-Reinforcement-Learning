                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours show a bulging contour
 along the left lower mediastinum posterior to the heart.  This may be due to
 tortuosity or dilatation of the aorta.  A hiatal hernia could also be
 considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  Bulging contour along the left lower mediastinum,
 possibly due to tortuosity or dilatation of the aorta or possibly a hiatal
 hernia, which could also be considered.  When clinically feasible, further
 evaluation with standard PA and lateral radiographs is suggested as initial
 further evaluation.  No definite acute disease.
