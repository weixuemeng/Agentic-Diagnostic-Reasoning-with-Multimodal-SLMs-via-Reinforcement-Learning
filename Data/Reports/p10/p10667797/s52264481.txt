                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The bilateral airspace opacities appear more confluent on today's study with
 extensive opacification of both lungs, partial silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Again, this likely reflects combination of pulmonary lymphoma,
 infection and pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes remain low with left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Support and monitoring equipment is unchanged in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The bilateral airspace opacities appear more confluent and extensive than on
 the prior study, this likely reflects combination of lymphoma, infection and
 superimposed pulmonary edema.
