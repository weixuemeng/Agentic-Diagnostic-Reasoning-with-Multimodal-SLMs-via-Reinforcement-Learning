                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nonproductive cough and left flank pain,
 point tenderness along left fifth rib.  Question pneumonia or fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There are bibasilar linear opacities, most suggestive
 of atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no displaced rib fracture or
 other visualized acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation is suggested to exclude possibility of pneumonia.
