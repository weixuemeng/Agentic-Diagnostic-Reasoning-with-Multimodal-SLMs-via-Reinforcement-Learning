                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal and chest pain.  Recent percutaneous cholecystostomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A pigtail catheter projects over the right upper quadrant.  A metallic stent
 also projects over the midline, recently deployed.  It is vertical in
 orientation and situated near the midline.  The metallic stent is somewhat
 distal to where a new pigtail stent was placed.  It is somewhat distal to the
 remaining revised internal-external pigtail biliary drain.  Correlation with
 procedure related findings is recommended.  
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a
 patchy focal opacity in the left upper lung, which is non-specific. 
 Atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia could be considered although atelectasis
 may be implied by coinciding volume loss.  Small pleural effusions are
 difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy nonspecific opacities in the left upper lung with a mild
 overall volume loss in the left hemithorax.  Correlation with procedure
 findings is suggested regarding the location of the biliary stents.
