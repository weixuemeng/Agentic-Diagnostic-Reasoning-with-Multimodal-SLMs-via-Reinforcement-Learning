                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 8:05
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with MVR, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 9:29.
 
 A portable AP supine chest film ___ at 8:05 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the
 introducer remaining in place with its tip in the proximal SVC.  Overall, the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this patient status post median
 sternotomy with mitral valve replacement.  There is increasing consolidation
 in the left lung base with an associated pleural effusion which has also
 increased.  These findings are most consistent with partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered.  There is also a
 layering right effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large
 pneumothorax.
