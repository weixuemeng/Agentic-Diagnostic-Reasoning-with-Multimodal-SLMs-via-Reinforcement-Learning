                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and low-grade temperatures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Large retrocardiac opacity is
 unchanged from the recent comparison from___ but
 progressed from ___. On review of imaging in the ___ system, the
 left lower lung has not been clear since surgery.  The remainder of the lung
 is clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mitral valve prosthesis are unchanged. 
 Sternal wires are intact.  There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased retrocardiac opacity. Diagnostic considerations include
 pneumonia with pleural effusion, post-pericardiotomy syndrome, airway
 obstruction and diaphragmatic paralysis, though this is less likely given the
 normal position of the colonic and gastric air bubbles. 
 
 Findings were discussed by phone with ___, PA for cardiac surgery,
 by Dr. ___ by phone at ___.
