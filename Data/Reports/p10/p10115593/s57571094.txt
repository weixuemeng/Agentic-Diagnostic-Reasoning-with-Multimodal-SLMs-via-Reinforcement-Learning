 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess atelectasis versus pneumonia postop.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Increased opacity projecting over the

 lower lobes.  There is mild right apical pleural thickening of unknown
 chronicity.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
