 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  On the lateral view there is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 with flattening hemidiaphragms, suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary
 disease.  On the frontal projection, however, there are relatively low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. No evidence of
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Mild
 atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
