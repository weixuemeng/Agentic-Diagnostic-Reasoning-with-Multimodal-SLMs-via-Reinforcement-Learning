                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post chest tube.  Evaluate placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left lateral approach chest tube projects over the mid lung and descends
 inferiorly.  The previously seen large left pleural effusion is substantially
 evacuated and no pneumothorax is seen.  Lateral view would be helpful in
 assessing the anterior component of the previous hydro pneumothorax.  .  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The right lung is clear.  There
 are multiple displaced left rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left lateral approach chest tube projects over the mid lung and descends
 inferiorly.  More exact positioning and assessment of the anterior component
 of previous hydro pneumothorax could be determined if a lateral radiograph is
 obtained.
