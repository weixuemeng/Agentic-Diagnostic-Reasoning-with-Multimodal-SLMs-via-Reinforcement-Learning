                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lower extremity edema and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left
 mid-to-lower lung opacity seen on the frontal view, not well seen on the
 lateral, view but appearing new since the prior study, may represent
 atelectasis; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, early consolidation
 is not excluded.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
