 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // assess for ptx, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding and
 exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, without frank edema.  Increased bibasilar opacities are likely
 consistent with atelectasis, however pneumonia or aspiration could be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  The heart remains enlarged. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Increased bibasilar opacities are likely consistent with atelectasis,
 however pneumonia or aspiration could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 2.  Engorged pulmonary vasculature.
