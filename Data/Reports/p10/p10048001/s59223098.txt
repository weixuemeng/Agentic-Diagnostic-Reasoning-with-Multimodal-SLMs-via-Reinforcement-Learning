                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers and bacteremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior study, the left PICC line has been removed.  A high right hemidiaphragm
 contour is unchanged.  There are linear opacifications in the left lower lung.
 The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones and soft tissues are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity in the left lower lung is most likely due to
 atelectasis but in view of the clinical history pneumonia should be
 considered.
