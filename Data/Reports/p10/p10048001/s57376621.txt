 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:57 PM
  Similar to prior study obtained this morning.  Denser heterogeneous opacity in
  left lower lobe with band-like appearance on the PA view.  A component of this
  is likely atelectasis but pneumonia should be considered in the right clinical
  context.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and crackles on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed seven hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior study, there has been slight interval increase in left lower lung linear
 opacities.  The heart size is unchanged and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour is unchanged.  The bones and soft tissues are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in left lower lobe linear opacities that
 are most likely atelectasis but in the proper clinical setting could represent
 pneumonia.
