                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:28 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cholangitis.  Evaluate for any interval
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low.  The right lung base is particularly elevated,
 most likely due to right upper quadrant mass effect or fluid and/or right
 subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal veins
 are engorged, but I doubt that there is pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
