                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and leg cyanosis  // Is there an acute
 process in lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are diffusely increased interstitial markings bilaterally,
 consistent with chronic underlying lung disease. The superimposed mild
 pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Anterior compression of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction was also seen on prior
 radiograph, grossly similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic lung disease with possible minimal superimposed pulmonary edema.
 Overall, no significant interval change since the prior study.
