                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and dyspnea in a patient with severe asthma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Minimally increased
 interstitial markings can be seen in patients with chronic asthma.  Small
 irregular opacities and an irregular pleural margin in the right apex are
 probably the sequela of prior infection. There is no focal consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or lobar collapse.  Normal heart and
 mediastinal surfaces.  A focal nodular opacity over the right lower lung is a
 nipple shadow.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small irregular opacities and an irregular pleural margin in the right
 lung apex are probably the sequela of prior infection.  Comparison with old
 x-rays is recommended to document stability.  If old x-rays are not available,
 chest CT is recommended for better characterization.  
 
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Comment:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 17:31 on ___ at the time of discovery.
