                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible air in mediastinum after repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.8
 cm above the carina.  The Dobbhoff tube straddles the esophagogastric junction
 with much of the metallic portion in the distal esophagus.  This tube should
 be pushed forward.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum,
 though this is not fully erect image.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially
 within normal limits.  There is some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary
 vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 The outer most portion of the right lung has been excluded from the image.
