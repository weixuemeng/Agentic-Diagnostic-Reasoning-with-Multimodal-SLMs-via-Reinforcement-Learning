 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian Port-A-Cath
 tip is now in the lower SVC.  Dobhoff tube is again coiled in the upper C
 stomach.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with moderate
 pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis
 at the bases.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
