 prominent pulmonary artery which could be related to the known pulmonary
 embolism or represent underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Clinical
 correlation is recommended.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  The azygos vein is dilated suggesting a fluid replete state and
 there is likely mild interstitial and perihilar edema. No obvious
 pneumothorax.  No large effusions.
