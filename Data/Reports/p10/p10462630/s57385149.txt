 disease status      Please evaluate disease status
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 and pleural surfaces are normal.  Pulmonary vessels seen on end should not be
 mistaken for soft tissue lung nodules.  There is no radiographic evidence of
 intrathoracic malignancy.  Of course chest CT scanning is more sensitive in
 the detection of small pulmonary nodules than conventional radiography.
