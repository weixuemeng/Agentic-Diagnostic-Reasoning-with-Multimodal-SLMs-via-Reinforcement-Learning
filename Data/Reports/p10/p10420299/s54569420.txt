                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Evaluate for
 infectious process or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One AP upright portable view of the chest.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Small pneumoperitoneum is expected post-laparoscopic procedure. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and shoulder region as well as the soft
 tissues of the torso bilaterally.   Right transvenous pacemaker leads are
 identified, one in the right atrium and one likely in the proximal right
 ventricle.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 2.  Pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema, likely post-operative given
 laparoscopic technique.
