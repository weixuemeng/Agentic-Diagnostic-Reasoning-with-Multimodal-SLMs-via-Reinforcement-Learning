                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Increased interstitial opacities are seen within
 the lung bases as well as within the lung periphery diffusely, findings
 suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may also reflect superimposed atelectasis, however there is no
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Marked
 degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable chronic interstitial lung disease with possible superimposed
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Comparison with previous radiographs would be helpful
 for further assessment, or consider nonemergent CT of the chest for further
 assessment if this has not been done previously.
