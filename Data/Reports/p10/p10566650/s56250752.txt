                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Opacity effacing
 the right cardiophrenic angle is probably due to minor atelectasis. In the
 left lower lobe there is persistent opacity but decreased and similar in
 distribution. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but decreased left lower lobe opacity. Although recurrent or
 slowing resolving pneumonia is not excluded, appearance may be due to waxing
 and waning chronic atelectatic change without available long-term prior
 follow-up to assess for the possibility.
