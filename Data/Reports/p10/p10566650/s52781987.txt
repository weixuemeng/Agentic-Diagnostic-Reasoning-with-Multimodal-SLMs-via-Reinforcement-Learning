                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted at the aortic knob. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases,
 most suggestive of atelectasis given the linear appearance. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect areas of atelectasis
 though infection is not completely excluded.
