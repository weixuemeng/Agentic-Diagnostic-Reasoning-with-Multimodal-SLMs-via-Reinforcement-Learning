                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman PO D 2 from liver resection with fever  //
 Assess for pleural effusion, exudate, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion probably has a subpulmonic as well as a lateral
 costal component. Heart is top-normal size. Lungs are low in volume but
 otherwise essentially clear. Conventional chest radiographs occluding frontal
 and lateral views, I strongly recommended for more reliable detection of
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is present.
