                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath and chest
 pain.  Recent resection of left hepatic hemangioma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is mild to moderately elevated, probably with a small
 subpulmonic effusion but likely decreased substantially.  There is persistent
 patchy right posterior basilar opacity overlying the diaphragm although
 atelectasis may be suspected in the early post-operative course as the likely
 cause.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right posterior basilar opacity, probably compatible with
 atelectasis, with persistent small decreased pleural effusion.  Pneumonia at
 the right lung base is not excluded however although post-operative volume
 loss seems more likely as the cause.
