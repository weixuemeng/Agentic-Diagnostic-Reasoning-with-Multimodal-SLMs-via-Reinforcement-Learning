 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for widened mediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low, though the lungs appear clear.  There are no convincing signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Linear density
 is seen at the left lung base abutting the left heart border which could
 represent small focus of scarring.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Degenerative changes and DISH is noted
 in the T-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Probable scarring at the left lung
 base.
