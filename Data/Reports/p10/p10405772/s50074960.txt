 INDICATION:  Productive cough for three weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a subtle heterogeneous opacity at
 the right lung base which partially obscures the right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour.  On lateral view, the costophrenic angles appear blunted.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  The heart is stably mildly enlarged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is a possible small pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Subtle opacity at the right base may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Recommend follow-up to resolution.
 2.  Possible small pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
