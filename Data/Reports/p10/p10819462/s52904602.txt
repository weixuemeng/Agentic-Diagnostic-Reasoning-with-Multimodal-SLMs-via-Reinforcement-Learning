                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  CHEST WALL PAIN X 6 WEEKS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
