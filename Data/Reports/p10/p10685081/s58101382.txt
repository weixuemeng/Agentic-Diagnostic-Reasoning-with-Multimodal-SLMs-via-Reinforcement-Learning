                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and diarrhea.  Known lung mass. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET scan from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Vague opacity projecting over the anterior
 left 1st rib is compatible with patient's known lung mass.  Left lower lobe
 pulmonary nodule also seen in the retrocardiac region on the frontal exam. 
 There is a new opacity at the left lung base laterally on the frontal view
 which is not clearly delineated on the lateral exam.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint left basilar opacity seen laterally not well seen on the lateral view. 
 All this could be due to atelectasis, developing infection is not completely
 excluded.    Known left apical lesion and left lower lobe and nodule as
 previously characterized.
