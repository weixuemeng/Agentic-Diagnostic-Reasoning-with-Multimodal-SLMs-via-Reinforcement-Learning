 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable left pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, performed at 1:50 p.m., the
 extensive left pneumothorax is better visible than on the current image.  At
 the lung apex, the diameter of the pneumothorax approximates 3 cm.  There is
 no evidence of tension on the frontal or lateral radiograph.  Known fiducial
 seed placement.  No change in appearance of the heart and of the cardiac
 silhouette.
