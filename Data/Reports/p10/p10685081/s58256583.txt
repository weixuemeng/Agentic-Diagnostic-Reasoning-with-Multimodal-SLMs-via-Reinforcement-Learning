                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 The patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs that limits the evaluation
 of presence of any pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is
 top normal; is accentuated by the low lung volumes.  There are minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Left apical lung lesion is better seen on prior CT. 
 There is no pleural effusion.
