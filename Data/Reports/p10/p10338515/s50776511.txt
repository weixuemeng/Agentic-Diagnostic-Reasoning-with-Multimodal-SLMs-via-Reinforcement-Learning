                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ significant cardiac history, s/p lap chole, now w/
 persistent O2 requirement. Pls eval for atelectasis vs pulm edema? // ___M w/

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volume is low, decreased compared to ___. There is pulmonary vessel
 engorgement, suggestive of volume overload. Mediastinum is widened, possibly
 secondary to the pulmonary vessel congestion, however aortic pathology cannot
 be ruled out.  Aortic contour is not clearly visualized and may appear
 artificially widened due to rotated position. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mediastinum is widened, possibly secondary to the pulmonary vessel congestion,
 however aortic pathology cannot be ruled out. Repeat conventional chest
 radiograph with erect AP view is recommended. If there is high clinical
 concern for aortic pathology, CT arteriogram can be obtained.
