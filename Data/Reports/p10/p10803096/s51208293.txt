                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, rigors  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:02.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prior right-sided central venous catheter is no longer visualized.  No large
 effusion identified noting resolution of prior moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity is most likely atelectasis. 
 Superiorly, lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity most likely atelectasis although infection is not
 entirely excluded.  Consider PA and lateral if patient is amenable. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
