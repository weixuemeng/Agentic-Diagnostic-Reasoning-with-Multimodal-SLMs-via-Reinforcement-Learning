 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Best seen on the lateral view

 opacity on prior chest CT.  Faint right basilar opacities are also seen
 suggesting atelectasis.  There is no effusion.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  Known pulmonary nodules are not clearly delineated on this exam. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basilar opacity, better seen by recent chest CT.
