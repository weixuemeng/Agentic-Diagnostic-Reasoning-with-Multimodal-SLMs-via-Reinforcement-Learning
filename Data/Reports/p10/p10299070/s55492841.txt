                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with new line placement  // ? ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Films from earlier the same day at 13:08 and 07:20.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is seen with tip the now approximately 1.8 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube is seen, tip not clearly identified but potentially off the
 inferior field of view. Right IJ central venous catheter is now seen. Given
 rotation to the left as well as leftward mediastinal shift, tip projects over
 the region of the mid SVC. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are again
 noted. There is dense retrocardiac opacity new since the exam from earlier
 today.  Even with rotation there is left-sided volume loss.  Only mild
 aeration seen at the left mid and upper lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   New right IJ line, no pneumothorax.
 2. ET tube tip is now 1.7 cm from the carina.
 3. Dense retrocardiac opacity progressed over the day and likely largely due
 to atelectasis potentially from mucous plugging, underlying aspiration or
 infection are also possible.
