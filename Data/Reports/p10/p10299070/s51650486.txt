 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.

 A left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely severe atelectasis, although more
 detail assessment is limited due to suboptimal positioning. Underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. The patient has been extubated, and orogastric tube and right IJ
 catheter removed.
