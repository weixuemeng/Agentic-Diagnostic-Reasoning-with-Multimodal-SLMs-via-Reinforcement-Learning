                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS  // Please eval for any PNA/aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and
 recommend pullback of the tube. A nasogastric tube terminates subdiaphragmatic
 and beyond the view of this radiograph.
 
 There is a left basilar opacity likely reflecting pleural effusion and
 underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A left upper
 mediastinal opacity is new from ___ and raises concern for a mass or aortic
 aneurysm.  There is mild vascular plethora, a without overt CHF. In the right
 lung, no focal consolidation or gross effusion. The cardiac silhouette is
 obscured on the left side, limiting assessment of cardiac size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left basilar pulmonary opacity likely represents a moderate pleural
 effusion with associated compressive atelectasis, and superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
 2.  Left upper mediastinal opacity may represent a mass, given the reported
 history of lung cancer (source uncertain). The differential diagnosis could
 include an aortic aneurysm.  Recommend further evaluation with CT.
 3.  Endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal left mainstem bronchus. 
 Recommend pullback of tube approximately 2 cm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 4:30 PM.
