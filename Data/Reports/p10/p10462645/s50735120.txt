                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead pacer is seen projecting over the left chest with pacer leads
 terminating over the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low
 and there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Heart size is grossly
 unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aortic arch. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Trace pleural fluid is possibly seen at
 the right costophrenic angle.  There is retrocardiac opacity that likely
 represents atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  Surgical clips
 are seen projecting over the lower midline.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity that likely reflects atelectasis, although infection
 is not excluded.
 
 2.  Possible trace right-sided pleural effusion.
