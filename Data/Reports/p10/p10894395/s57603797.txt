 INDICATION:  History: ___F with continued cough, evaluate for pneumonia  //
 Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate well expanded lungs. 
 Note is made of a subtle opacity in the right mid lung, which is not
 definitely seen on the lateral view.  It is unclear if this finding is within
 the lung, or due to overlapping structures.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung is of uncertain etiology.  Could
 overlap of structures versus pulmonary nodule.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung is of uncertain
 etiology.  Recommend further evaluation with shallow oblique radiographs, or
 CT of the chest.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated impression and recommendations were emailed to be ED QA
 nurses on ___.
