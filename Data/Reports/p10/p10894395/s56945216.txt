                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and fever with CXR at urgent care
 with subtle RML lesion seen on one view only. Report notes, "Subtle opacity in
 the right mid lung is of uncertain etiology. Recommend further evaluation with
 shallow oblique radiographs, or CT of the chest.  // please evaluate subtle
 right middle lobe lesion noted on CXR from ___. PLEASE PERFORM SHALLOW
 OBLIQUE RADIOGRAPHS  please evaluate subtle right middle lobe lesion noted on
 CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  Oblique views are read in conjunction with conventional PA and
 lateral chest radiographs on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no abnormalities conforming to the cluster of irregular opacity seen
 on the previous study except for minimal bronchial wall thickening in the
 anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  Unless there was a pulmonary
 abnormality that has cleared in less than 2 days, the questioned lung lesions
 are probably calcifications in the right fourth anterior rib cartilage.
