                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SAH after bicycle accident  // evaluate for ET
 tube placment, aspiration, rib fracture, other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest, SUPINE, PORTABLE
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.2 cm above the level of
 the carinal. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level the diaphragm,
 inferior aspect not included on the image, with side port at the expected
 location of the proximal stomach/GE junction, and could be slightly advanced. 
 Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities may be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration.
 Right lower lobe linear atelectasis/ scarring is also seen. No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged,
 likely exaggerated by supine position and AP technique.  No displaced fracture
 is identified. There is a subtle lucency projecting over the distal left
 clavicle, measuring a 1.1 cm, unclear whether artifactual or a potential lytic
 lesion. Correlate with history of malignancy.
