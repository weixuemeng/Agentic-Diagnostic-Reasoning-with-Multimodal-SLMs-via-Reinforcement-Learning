 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Desaturations.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, the NG tube has been introduced with its tip in the
 stomach.  The patient is after abdominal surgery.  New bilateral, left more
 than right atelectases are substantial and potentially with small amount of
 pleural effusion.  No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  The slight left
 mediastinal shift is consistent with substantial decrease in volume of the
 left lower lobe.
