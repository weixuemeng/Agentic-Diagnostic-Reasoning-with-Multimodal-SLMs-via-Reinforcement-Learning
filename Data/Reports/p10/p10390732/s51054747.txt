                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with malaise and fevers  // evaluate for pneumonia,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is stable in position, terminating in the low SVC/
 cavoatrial junction.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac
 valve replacement.  Right vascular stent is re- demonstrated.  There is
 persistent blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, to lesser extent as
 compared to the prior study.  Left base atelectasis/scarring is seen,
 consolidation due to pneumonia is less likely.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in bilateral mid to lower lung opacities with blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles persisting.  Decreased left base patchy
 opacity,, most likely representing atelectasis/scarring, however, underlying
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
