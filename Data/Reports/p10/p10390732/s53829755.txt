                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p port-a-cath placement  // assess for
 placement/PTX      assess for placement/PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement are new, mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly has increased, suggesting that new pulmonary opacification mid
 and lower lung zones is probably dependent edema due to cardiac
 decompensation.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Pneumonia or
 pulmonary infarction would be difficult to appreciate given the concurrent
 findings.
 
 Left internal jugular line does not extend far or at all into the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  The lateral angulation of the tip suggests it is in a
 small vein such as the left internal mammary or left superior intercostal. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Because of mediastinal widening, I cannot exclude a
 new mediastinal hematoma.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 9:35 AM, 90 minutes a series of pages to other physicians
 beginning immediately after discovery of the findings.
