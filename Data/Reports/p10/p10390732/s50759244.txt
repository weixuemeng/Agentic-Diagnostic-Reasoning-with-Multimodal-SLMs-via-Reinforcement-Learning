                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Positioning disease status post kidney transplant with hypoxia and
 respiratory failure.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube appears in place at 5.7 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 traverses to the stomach.  Median sternotomy wires, mitral valve prosthesis,
 and vascular stents projecting over the region of the brachiocephalic and
 right subclavian vein appear unchanged.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 appear unchanged.  
 
 There is however a new right basilar opacity with obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is again noted and may be representative of atelectasis or infection,
 possibly due to aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions likely persists. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New right basilar opacity with persistant retrocardiac opacity.  These
 findings are suspicious for aspiration with possible overlying infection in
 the proper clinical setting versus atelectasis.  Support structures appear in
 place. Continued followup is recommended.
