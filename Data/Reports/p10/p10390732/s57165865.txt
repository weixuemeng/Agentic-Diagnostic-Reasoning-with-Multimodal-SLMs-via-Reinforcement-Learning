                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, presenting for a possible kidney
 transplant.  Preoperative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is redemonstration of midline sternotomy wires and aortic as well as mitral
 valve replacements.  A vascular stent projects over the region of the right
 subclavian/brachiocephalic vein.  There is subsegmental left lower lung
 atelectasis, as before.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent
 with a small left pleural effusion, not significantly changed.  There may be a
 trace right pleural effusion, also not significantly changed.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips
 are noted in the bilateral upper abdominal quadrants.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left and possible trace right pleural effusions, not significantly
 changed.
 
 2.  Minimal left lower lung atelectasis.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild enlargement of the heart.
