                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough with prior pneumonia.  Assess for residual pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valves are noted as well as a metallic
 stent projecting over the right upper lung.  There is a small amount of
 blunting at the CP angles bilaterally which is stable and could represent
 chronic effusions or pleural thickening.  There is stable retrocardiac linear
 density which is most compatible with scarring.  There are no definite signs
 of pneumonia or CHF.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact, though diffusely
 sclerotic, which could reflect renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  Stable blunting of the CP angles
 likely indicates trace chronic effusions or pleural thickening.
