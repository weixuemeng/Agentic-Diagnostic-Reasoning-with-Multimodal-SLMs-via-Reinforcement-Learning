                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with desat w ambulation  // assess for causes of
 desaturation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC.  Sternotomy wires,
 vascular stent and prosthetic valves are in unchanged position.  Pulmonary
 opacities within the left upper lobe, right lower lobe and right middle lobe
 reflect a moderate bilateral loculated pleural effusion as characterized on
 recent CT from ___.  The left lower lobe is better aerated compared to
 the prior exam.  The heart is moderately enlarged but stable in size.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive loculated pleural effusion is demonstrated, minimally improved from
 ___ and better characterized on recent CT from ___. 
 Right-sided opacities predominantly affecting the inferior portion of the
 right upper lobe and the right lower lobe are most consistent with the
 loculated effusion however underlying infection should be considered in the
 appropriate setting.
