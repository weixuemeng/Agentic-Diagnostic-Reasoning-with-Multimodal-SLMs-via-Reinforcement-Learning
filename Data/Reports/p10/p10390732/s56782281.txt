 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:01 PM
  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, similar in appearance compared to the prior
  radiographs from ___ (new compared to the most recent radiograph from
  ___).  Somewhat rounded heterogeneous opacities in the left
  mid-to-lower lung and right mid and lower lung could be areas of asymmetric
  edema versus multifocal infection; clinical correlation is advised.  Small
  bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed compared to the ___ study.  Mild cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  A vascular
  stent projects over the medial aspect of the right upper lung.  The patient is
  status post midline sternotomy and aortic / mitral valve replacement. 
  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ at 21:59 via telephone on
  the day of the study, ___ min after discovery

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with weight gain of 20 pounds and swelling. 
 Evaluate vascular congestion and edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
  
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular caliber have increased, small
 right pleural effusion is larger, but the opacities that have developed at
 both lung bases do not look like asymmetric edema.  They could be atelectasis,
 but pneumonia is a possibility.  Elevation of one of the lung bases
 posteriorly, probably the left, is chronic.
