                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with chest pain to back  // Please eval for aortic
 dissection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but clear without focal consolidation or large
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is
 somewhat tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  Of note,
 there is an unusual contour of the undersurface of the aortic arch with
 slightly medial lies atherosclerotic calcifications which do indeed raise
 possibility of dissection.    Right chest wall dual lead pacing device is
 again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Abnormal contour to the region of the aortic arch with possibly medialized
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  CTA is suggested to exclude the possibility
 of dissection- which had already been ordered.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 18:30 on ___.
