                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man found down, assess intrathoracic injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph is obtained.  Underlying trauma
 board limits evaluation.  The lateral most aspect of the right CP angle is
 excluded.  There is streaky opacity in the right upper lung which could
 represent a small amount of aspiration or atelectasis. The lungs appear
 otherwise clear, though lung volumes are low.  No large consolidation is seen.
 No supine evidence of pneumothorax or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lung streaky opacity, likely atelectasis or
 aspiration.  Otherwise, no acute findings.
