 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male patient with hypoxia trying to get into
 detoxification program, history of ethanol, evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP and lateral chest examination ___ ___.  Previously identified mild
 cardiac enlargement has regressed and presently the cardiac contours are
 within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but
 there are no local suspicious contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  The patient's inability to elevate arms somewhat detract from the image
 quality on the lateral view but again no acute abnormality is identified.  In
 comparison with the next previous examination at that time existing mild
 congestive pulmonary pattern has normalized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No residuals of previously identified questionable CHF. 
 Presently, the chest findings are within normal limits.
