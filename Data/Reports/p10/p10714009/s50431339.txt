                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain status post fall.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.
 Even given the low lung volumes, there is at least moderate cardiomegaly.  No
 large focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax is seen.  In the
 posterolateral right tenth rib, callus formation is suggestive of a subacute
 or healed fracture. No acute fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute fracture identified.  Healed posterolateral right tenth rib
 fracture.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. Low lung volumes.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is
 clinically warranted, the location where there are focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
