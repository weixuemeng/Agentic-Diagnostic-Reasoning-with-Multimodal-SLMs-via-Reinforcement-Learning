                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with neck and back pain.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT ___
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated.  Linear retrocardiac opacity likely corresponds to atelectasis.  An
 apparent nodule in the left lower lobe corresponds to a prominent nipple, not
 a lung nodule on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac atelectasis.
