                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVC with diaphragmatic rupture s/p
 intubation  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the pulmonary vascular congestion has
 essentially cleared.  Opacification at the left base is again consistent with
 pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis as well as posttraumatic changes
 consistent with diaphragmatic rupture.  The right pleural effusion appears to
 have substantially improved, though some of this may merely reflect a more
 upright position of the patient.
