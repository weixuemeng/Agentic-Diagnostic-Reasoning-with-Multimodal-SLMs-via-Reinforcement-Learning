                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with questionable pneumonia.  Evaluate interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The examination is limited secondary to patient rotation.  The tracheostomy
 tube projects in the craniocaudal dimension.  Right PICC line terminates in
 the low SVC.  Enteric tube appears to course beyond the diaphragm.  Multilevel
 thoracic spine stabilization hardware is again seen.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.  There is apparent
 improvement in aeration of left lower lobe, although it is mostly obscured due
 to patient rotation.  Mild interstitial edema is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Suboptimal radiograph secondary to patient positioning with obscuration of
 the left lower lobe.
 2.  Mild interstitial edema, stable.
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, stable.
