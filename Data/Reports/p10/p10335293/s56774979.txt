                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  ___ year old woman with SSS s/p dual chamber PPM. Please eval
 for lead position and post procedure complications.  // ___ year old woman with
 SSS s/p dual chamber PPM. Please eval for lead position and post procedure
 complications.    ___ year old woman with SSS s/p dual chamber PPM. Please eval
 for lead position and post procedure complications.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views done in a wheelchair.  Bronchovascular markings are
 increased, as before.  There is streaky density bilaterally consistent with
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  There is ill-defined increased density
 in the right lung base.  There is evidence of a small right pleural effusion
 or pleural thickening.
 
 The heart appears large although cardiac size may be exaggerated by AP
 technique.  There is evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The aorta is calcified. 
 Allowing for differences in technique, mediastinal structures appear stable. 
 A bipolar transvenous pacemaker is been inserted with the intact electrodes
 properly placed.
 
 Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body a chronic fracture of
 the right clavicle and degenerative changes in the shoulders are again
 demonstrated, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent bronchovascular markings which are likely chronic.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring.  Mild vascular congestion would be difficult to
 exclude.  There is pleural thickening and or fluid at the right base that
 partially obscures the underlying portion of the right lung.  A bipolar
 transvenous pacemaker appears to be in satisfactory position.
