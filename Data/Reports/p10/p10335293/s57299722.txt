 PNA, pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the enlargement of cardiac
 silhouette appears less prominent and the pulmonary vascularity is essentially
 within normal limits.  Opacification at the left base suggests volume loss in
 the lower lobe and possible effusion.  On the right, however, there is a more
 coalescent area with possible air bronchograms.  Although some of this could
 represent merely atelectatic changes, especially in view of the clinical
 history the possibility of superimposed pneumonia should be seriously
 considered.
