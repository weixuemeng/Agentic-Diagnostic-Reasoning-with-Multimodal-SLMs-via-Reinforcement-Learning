                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and pancreatic cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on
 the left, with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion has substantially decreased and the pulmonary vasculature
 is essentially within normal limits.
 
 The right Port-A-Cath is unchanged, as is the apparent hepatic shunt.
