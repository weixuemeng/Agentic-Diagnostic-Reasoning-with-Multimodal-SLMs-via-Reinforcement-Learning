                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___ AT 22:45.
 
 HISTORY:  Flash pulmonary edema, now hypotensive and OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The OG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.  ET tube
 and right-sided Port-A-Cath are unchanged.  Hazy alveolar infiltrates, central
 greater than peripheral, are again seen, but are slightly improved.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a right upper quadrant stent in
 place with gas seen, presumably in the biliary system.
