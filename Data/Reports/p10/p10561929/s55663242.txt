                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pancreatic cancer, having
 decreased breath sounds on left base.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view portable
 chest examination obtained four hours earlier during the same day.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is again identified.  On the present examination, the patient is
 able to make a deeper inspiratory effort now clearly identifying bilateral
 pleural effusion, slightly more on the left than the right.  Lateral view
 confirms this finding as the posterior dependent pleural sinuses are also
 blunted.  Degree of effusion is moderate.  Comparison is extended to the PA
 and lateral chest view of ___, at which time similar amount of
 bilateral pleural effusions were present.  The degree of cardiac enlargement
 appears to be similar.  Presently, there is no advanced pulmonary congestive
 pattern or any signs of interstitial or alveolar edema.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath system remains in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings most likely representing chronic CHF.
