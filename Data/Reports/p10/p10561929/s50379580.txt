 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  A preliminary report was issued by Dr. ___ at 10:35 p.m.
 stating that the OG tube tip was not seen due to motion artifact.  The tube is

 Port-A-Cath are unchanged.  Alveolar infiltrates cannot be well assessed due
 to motion on the film.
