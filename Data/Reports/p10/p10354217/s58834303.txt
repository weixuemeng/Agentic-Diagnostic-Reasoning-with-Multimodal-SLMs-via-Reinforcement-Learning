                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post redo sternotomy with
 tissue aortic valve prosthesis replacement and bypass surgery including aortic
 patch for arch.  Now discharge evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy.  Unchanged appearance
 of sternal wires as well as multiple surgical clips mostly in anterior
 mediastinal left-sided position as before.  Significant cardiac enlargement
 persists.  The pulmonary vasculature, however, is not significantly congested
 with the exception of a few minor peripheral plate atelectasis, no significant
 parenchymal abnormalities persist.  The left-sided basal pleural density
 blunting the pleural sinus and obliterating the lateral portion of the
 diaphragm is still present.  The lateral view demonstrates only a small amount
 of pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior pleural sinus.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-operative chest findings.  Persistent left-sided
 pleural scar and marked cardiac enlargement.  No evidence of significant
 pulmonary congestion presently, and no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.
