                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F ___ episode of LBO w/sigmoid wall thickening/adhesions
 concerning for possible malignancy vs diverticular abscess now s/p exlap,
 sigmoid colectomy, 1'repair SB injury, end colostomy  // eval pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Free intraperitoneal air below the right hemidiaphragm is likely due to
 provided history of recent abdominal surgery. Marked leftward patient rotation
 limits evaluation of cardiomediastinal contours. Moderate to large left
 pleural effusion is accompanied by adjacent left lower lobe collapse. Right
 lung is clear except for minor linear atelectasis of the right lung base and a
 small adjacent pleural effusion. Repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful
 for more complete assessment of the chest when the patient's condition
 permits.
