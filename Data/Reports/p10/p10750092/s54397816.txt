                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates no change in
 aeration accounting for differences in positioning.  The patient remains
 intubated, with the tip of the endotracheal tube positioned 3.5 cm from the
 level of the carina.  An NG tube is in place with its tip projecting over the
 expected position of the stomach, and sidehole projecting over the expected
 position of the distal esophagus.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
 2. NG tube sidehole in the distal esophagus, could be advanced several
 centimeters to decrease the risk of aspiration.
