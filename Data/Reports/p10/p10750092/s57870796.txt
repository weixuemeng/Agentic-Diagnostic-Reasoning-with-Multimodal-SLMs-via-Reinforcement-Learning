                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Semi-upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 3.2 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is again seen with side
 hole at the level of GE junction.  Right subclavian catheter terminates in the
 mid SVC.  Bibasilar left greater than right atelectasis is unchanged with
 slight decrease in edema. A right midlung opacity is more apparent given the
 decreased edema and may reflect an early pneumonia.  Cardiac size and
 tortuosity of the aorta is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slightly decreased edema with bibasilar atelectasis and newly
 evident right midlung opacity which may reflect a developing pneumonia. 
 
 Finding was discussed by phone with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on
