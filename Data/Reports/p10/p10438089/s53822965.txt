                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left lung collapse, planning possible
 bronchoscopy.  // Assess lung volumes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been worsening of consolidation/collapse of the left lung.  Some
 aerated lung is still present in the left apex.  There is a small left apical
 pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally improved. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are shifted to the left.  Cardiomegaly cannot be
 assessed.  Irregularity of the right proximal humerus is partially evaluated,
 likely related to prior trauma
