 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD___ s/p decortication  // Evaluate for
 hemothorax/pneumothorax s/p CT pull. Please perform at 10:00am.      Evaluate
 for hemothorax/pneumothorax s/p CT pull. Please perform at 10:00am.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the endotracheal tube is been removed.
 The left chest tubes have been removed and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm
 again is consistent with some combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
 The increased opacification in the right upper zone has substantially cleared.
 Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure and there are atelectatic changes at the right base.
