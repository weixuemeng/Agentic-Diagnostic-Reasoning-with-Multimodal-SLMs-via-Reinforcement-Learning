                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleuritic chest pain with respirations. 
 // ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures. Considering this factor, heart size is upper limits of normal.
 Lungs are grossly clear on the PA view. Localized opacity in the infrahilar
 region the lateral view is probably due to confluence of vascular structures
 accentuated by the low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 2.  Infrahilar opacity on lateral radiograph, most likely due to
 superimposition of vascular structures accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Repeat lateral radiograph with improved technique is suggested to confirm this
 impression and to exclude the possibility of a nodule or mass in this region.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 16:46 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
