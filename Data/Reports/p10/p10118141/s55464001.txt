                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post cardiac arrest, intubated.  Evaluate
 for acute process, endotracheal tube tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an endotracheal tube in appropriate position, terminating 3.7 cm
 above the level of carina.  A right internal jugular central venous line
 terminates in the mid SVC.  An enteric tube terminates in the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular
 structures.  The heart is top-normal in size given the low lung volumes. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriate position of support lines and devices.  Low lung volumes.
