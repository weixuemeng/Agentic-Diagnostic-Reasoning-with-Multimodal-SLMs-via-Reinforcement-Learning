                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Check ET and OG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:12 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, an ET tube has been placed.  The tip lies at the
 level of the mid clavicular heads approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  An
 NG/OG type tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, overlying the
 upper/mid left abdomen.  Right IJ central line tip unchanged, over distal SVC.
 Additional pigtail catheter over the lower abdomen, not fully evaluated.
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, there is a moderate-sized left effusion
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The effusion appears larger
 than on the earlier film.  There is also vascular plethora and interstitial
 edema, consistent with CHF, overall similar to prior.  Patchy opacity at the
 right base is also similar.  No gross right effusion identified, though A
 small RIGHT effusion would be difficult to exclude.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  NG/og tube tip beneath
 diaphragm.  
 2.   CHF with interstitial edema again seen. Increased left effusion.  
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and patchy opacity at right
 base again noted.
