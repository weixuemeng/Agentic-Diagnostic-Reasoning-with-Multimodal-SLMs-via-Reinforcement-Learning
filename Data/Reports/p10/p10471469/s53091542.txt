 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube now terminates about 6 cm above the carina
 and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Bibasilar atelectasis and adjacent pleural
 effusions are slightly improved in the interval.  However, a heterogeneous
 opacity in the right upper and mid lung region is new, and could reflect
 either a focus of aspiration or developing pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiograph may be helpful in this
 regard.
