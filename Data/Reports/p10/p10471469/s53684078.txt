 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of
 bilateral dorsal pleural effusions of mild-to-moderate extent.  The effusions
 are better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal image.  The
 effusions cause mild bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  No cardiomegaly.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal contours.  No evidence of pneumonia.
