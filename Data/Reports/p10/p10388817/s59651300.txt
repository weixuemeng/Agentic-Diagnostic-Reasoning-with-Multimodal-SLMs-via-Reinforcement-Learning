 INDICATION:  ___M intubated
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine radiograph through the chest demonstrates an
 endotracheal tube which terminates 1.6 cm from the level of the carina. For
 more appropriate positioning, this should be withdrawn 3-4 cm.  An enteric
 tube is seen descending through the thorax in an uncomplicated course.  A
 right central line appears to terminate within the mid SVC. Heart is enlarged.
 The left costophrenic angle is incompletely image. There is obscuration of the
 right hemidiaphragm which may reflect a pleural effusion. There is no overt
 pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is seen.
 There is no pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures demonstrates no acute
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
