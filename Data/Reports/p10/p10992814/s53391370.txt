  1. Since the prior radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has

  2. Dense right lower lobe consolidation, consistent with pneumonia.
  3. Mild alveolar pulmonary edema.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, respiratory distress, and newly

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ through ___ at 05:20.
 
 Severe consolidation in the right lower lobe has worsened.  Pulmonary
 vasculature has grown progressively more engorged accompanied by new mild
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable. 
 Pleural effusions are presumed.  Volume on the right is indeterminate in
 setting of the large area of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube and right central venous infusion port are in standard placements. 
 New esophageal tube has been inserted, and passes as far as the low esophagus
 but the tip is indistinct.
