                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient suspected for chronic thromboembolism. 
 Chest examination prior to V/Q scan of examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present with prominence of
 left ventricular contour and that of the left atrium.  This suggests the
 possibility of moderate mitral valve incompetence.  No other significant
 abnormalities are present and the lungs are not congested.  The previously
 identified bilateral pleural effusions have disappeared.  A new finding
 consists of a hazy density occupying the lateral and superior aspect of the
 right-sided hemithorax and coinciding with a clearly prominent soft tissue
 mass in the right axilla.  There is no evidence of remaining pleural effusions
 laterally or posteriorly.  In comparison with the previous examination, this
 new right-sided axillary density is new.  Referring physician, ___. ___
 ___ was contacted by telephone to report the questionable findings.  The
 time was 4:15 p.m.
