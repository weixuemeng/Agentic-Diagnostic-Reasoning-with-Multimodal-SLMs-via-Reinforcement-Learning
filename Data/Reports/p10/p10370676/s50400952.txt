                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Preliminary to starting therapy for latent tuberculosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph reviewed in the absence of prior
 chest radiographs:
 
 Solitary calcified granuloma is present at the right lung apex.  There is
 minimal scarring in the lingula, but no findings suggesting reactivation
 tuberculosis.  Hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragm contours
 indicate emphysema or small airway obstruction.  Heart is normal size.  Hilar
 and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
