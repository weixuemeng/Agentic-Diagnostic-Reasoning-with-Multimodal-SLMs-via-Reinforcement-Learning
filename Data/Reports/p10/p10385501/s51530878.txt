                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC. Again, there is an
 opacity at the right base with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 suggesting volume loss and atelectasis. A component of infection cannot be
 completely excluded. Additionally, there is a small right pleural effusion.
 This is similar to the prior exam. The left lung is essentially clear. There
 is mild vascular congestion. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with stable mild
 cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change from the prior exam, including right basilar
 opacification, volume loss, and a small right pleural effusion. While the
 opacity and volume loss together suggest atelectasis, a component of infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
