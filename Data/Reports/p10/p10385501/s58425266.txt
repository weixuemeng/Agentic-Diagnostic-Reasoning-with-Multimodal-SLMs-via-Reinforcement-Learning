                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacification within the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflects a
 combination of a moderate pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Infection
 or aspiration in the right lung base cannot be excluded.  Cardiac silhouette
 size remains at least mildly enlarged, but difficult to assess on this exam
 due to the right basilar opacity.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification within the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflects a
 combination of a moderate pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis,
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
