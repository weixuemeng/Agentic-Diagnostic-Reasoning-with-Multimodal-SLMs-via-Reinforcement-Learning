 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is moderately enlarged. 
 The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Hilar contours are normal.  Elevation of left

 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the left
 axilla, and the patient appears to be status post left mastectomy.  Multiple
 clips are also seen within the upper abdomen, only on the lateral view.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
