                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer is again noted with single lead terminating in the region of
 the right ventricle.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is again noted
 with dense mitral annular calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications appearing most pronounced at the
 aortic knob.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Increased streaky opacities in
 the lung bases are noted, potentially worsening atelectasis though infection,
 particularly in the left lung base is not completely excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect worsening atelectasis though
 infection in the left lung base is not completely excluded.
