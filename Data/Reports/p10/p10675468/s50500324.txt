                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question right shoulder fracture; the patient also presents with
 chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is calcification along the arch of the
 aorta as well as moderate unfolding.  Moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is somewhat greater than on the prior examination.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild but diffuse interstitial
 abnormality suggests mild fluid overload or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Fissures also appear thickened.  Degenerative changes are incompletely
 characterized along the right shoulder.  There is severe rightward spinal
 curvature centered along the mid lumbar spine with moderate leftward lower
 thoracic curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
