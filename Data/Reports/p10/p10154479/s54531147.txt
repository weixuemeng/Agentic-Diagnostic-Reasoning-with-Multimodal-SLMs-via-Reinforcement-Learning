                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and productive cough, evaluate for acute process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated but clear.  Rounded focal opacities seen at the right
 lung base likely represents a nipple shadow.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again noted is a large hiatal hernia.  Note
 is made of mild compression deformities of two vertebral bodies at the
 thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate age.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of COPD.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process. Mild compression deformities of two vertebral bodies at the
 thoracolumbar junction of indeterminate age.
