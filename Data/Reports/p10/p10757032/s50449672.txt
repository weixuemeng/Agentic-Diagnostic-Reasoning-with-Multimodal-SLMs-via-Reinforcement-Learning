                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 There is a large pneumonia in the right lower lobe accompanied by a small
 pleural effusion in ___.  The pneumonia substantially cleared leaving behind
 a large region of right lower lobe atelectasis which persists.  Small right
 pleural effusion has recurred since ___.  This could be due to the
 persistent atelectasis.  Heart is chronically moderately enlarged, but there
 is no pulmonary edema.  Lateral view shows a small left pleural effusion as
 well.  Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placement. 
 Overall, there are no findings strongly suggestive of pneumonia.
