                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Left
 sided triple-lead AICD is unchanged in position.  The lung volumes are
 slightly decreased.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely representing chronic atelectasis/scarring are
 stable.  The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image and a
 small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is trace blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle and a trace left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
