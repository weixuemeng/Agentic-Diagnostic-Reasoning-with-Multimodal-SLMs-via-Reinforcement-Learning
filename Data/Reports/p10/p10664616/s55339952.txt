 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New onset of fever, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric
 tube has been removed.  Lung volumes have returned to normal.  However, in the
 right lung base, triangular opacity with subtle air bronchograms is
 visualized.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this area could represent
 pneumonia.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.  Normal size and shape of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 At the time of image acquisition, a wet read was delivered.
