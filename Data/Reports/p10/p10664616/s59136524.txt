                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of the patient post-intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is visualized with the tip in the upper
 trachea.  An enteric tube is visualized traversing through the stomach.  The
 lung volumes are low, but the lungs are without a focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube is in the upper trachea and may be further
 advanced by 5 cm for optimal positioning.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
