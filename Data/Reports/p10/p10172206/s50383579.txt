                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest with tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be about
 3.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends at least to the distal
 esophagus, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  There is
 suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base, which could
 reflect aspiration or atelectasis.  Otherwise, little change.
