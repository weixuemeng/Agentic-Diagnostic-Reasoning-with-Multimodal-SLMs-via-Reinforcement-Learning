                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe NSCLC endobronchial tumor, now status post sleeve
 resection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 7:28 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Two left-sided chest tubes are in place.  
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, consistent with volume loss.  Lucency at
 the lung base outlining the left hemidiaphragm raises the question of a
 possible subtle pneumothorax.  There is shift of the mediastinum to left, more
 pronounced than on the film from one day earlier.  There is some patchy
 opacity at the left base, unchanged.  There is prominent subcutaneous
 emphysema along the left chest wall, similar to prior. The right lung is
 grossly clear, without CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion.  There is
 atelectasis at the right base, which appears slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Volume loss on the left side, with suggestion of increased leftward
 mediastinal shift.  Clinical correlation requested.  
 2) No definite pneumothorax, but lucency at the left lung base raises the
 possibility of an occult left-sided pneumothorax.  
 3) Overall, the left lung is otherwise relatively well expanded, except for
 minimal atelectasis at the left base.
