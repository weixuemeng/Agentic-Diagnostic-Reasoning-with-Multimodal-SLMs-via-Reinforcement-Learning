 INDICATION:  Status post left upper lobe sleeve resection, here to evaluate

 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is decreased subcutaneous emphysema overlying the left
 hemithorax from the most recent prior study of ___.  There is increased
 opacification in the left anterior hemithorax previously occupied by the left
 upper lobe with increased fluid in a persistent left hydropneumothorax.  There
 is a persistent moderate left pleural effusion.  The right lung is fully
 expanded and clear without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The left cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by fluid. 
 The right mediastinal contour and hila are within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased fluid filling the left anterior hemithorax surgical cavity.
 2.  Decreased moderate left pleural effusion with improved aeration at the
 left lower lobe from the most recent prior study of ___.
 3.  Decreased subcutaneous emphysema over the left hemithorax.
