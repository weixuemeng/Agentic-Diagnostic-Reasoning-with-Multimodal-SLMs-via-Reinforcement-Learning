                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe endobronchial tumor status post sleeve resection,
 rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 7:35 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, one left-sided chest tube is present, another
 appears to have been removed.  The left lung is relatively well expanded,
 allowing for elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The mediastinum appears
 midline.  Again seen is some hazy opacity and pleural fluid or thickening at
 the left base, considerably improved compared with earlier the same day. 
 There is also slight pleural fluid and/or thickening and hazy opacity at the
 left upper zone.  No obvious pneumothorax.  Previous lucency seen at the left
 lung base is no longer visualized.  Considerable subcutaneous emphysema along
 the left chest wall and along the upper aspect of the left chest is again
 seen.  Minimal pleural thickening along the lateral left chest wall is also
 present.  The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF, focal consolidation or
 effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base is probably present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of one of the two left-sided chest tubes.  No
 obvious pneumothorax.  Partial interval improvement in opacity at the left
 base compared with prior film.
