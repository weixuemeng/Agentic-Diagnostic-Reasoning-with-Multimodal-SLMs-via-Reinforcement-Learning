                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement, shortness of breath, evaluation of
 consolidation versus pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the air-fluid level is no
 longer visible.  Multiple lines caused by the massive air collection in the
 soft tissue overlay the left hemithorax.  However, there is no single line
 that could be attributed to pneumothorax.  Unchanged opacities at the bases of
 the left hemithorax.  Unchanged appearance of the right lung.
