 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman after left upper lobe sleeve resection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Aeration in the post-resection left lung has improved slightly, but the large
 persistent anterior pleural space is no smaller, and now contains a little
 more fluid.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left neck and chest wall is
 minimally improved.  Right lung grossly clear.  Severe leftward mediastinal
 shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are still pronounced.
