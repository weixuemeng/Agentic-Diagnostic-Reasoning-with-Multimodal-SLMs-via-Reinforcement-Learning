                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Female with chest tube removal.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 Presumptive assumption is that there is interval increase in subcutaneous
 emphysema of air leak as well as substantial volume of persistent pleural
 space and anterior hemithorax with fluid.  The right lung is clear without
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size obscured by fluid.  Right
 mediastinal contour and hila are normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Air leak given substantial increase in subcutaneous emphysema. 
 Substantial persistent pleural space and anterior hemithorax with fluid of
 unclear etiology.
