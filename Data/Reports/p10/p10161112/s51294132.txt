 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:

 internal reticular pattern, less discrete on the lateral view.  There is
 slight leftward shift of the mediastinum and left volume loss, relating to
 prior left upper lobectomy.  Surgical clips are again seen.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The findings are
 unchanged since the ___ examination.
