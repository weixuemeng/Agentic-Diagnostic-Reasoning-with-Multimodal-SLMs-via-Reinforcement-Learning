                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe non-small cell lung cancer, endobronchial tumor,
 after sleeve resection.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, ___, and 6:30 a.m. today:
 
 While I do not see any left pneumothorax, there has been interval increase in
 subcutaneous emphysema in the left neck and chest wall which is sometimes an
 indication of incipient pneumothorax.  Two left pleural tubes unchanged in
 position, one at the base, one at the apex of the small postoperative left
 hemithorax.  Left lung is well aerated.  Right lung is entirely clear.  There
 may be a small right pleural effusion.  Leftward mediastinal shift is as
 expected.
