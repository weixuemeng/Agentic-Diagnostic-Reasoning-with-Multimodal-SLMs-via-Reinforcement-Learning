                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left thoracotomy and
 left upper lobe sleeve resection.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval decrease in loculated left pleural effusion and decrease in
 the amount of subcutaneous air.  The more left mediastinal shift is most
 likely explained by the decrease in pleural effusion.  Elevated left
 hemidiaphragm represents part of the surgery.  Right lung is essentially
 clear.  Still substantial amount of pleural effusion can be seen on the
 lateral radiograph.  A small amount of right pleural effusion is unchanged.
