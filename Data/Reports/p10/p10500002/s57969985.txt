                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, fever.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal,
 hilar and cardiac contours.  Streaky atelectasis is again noted in the
 bilateral lung bases without definitive opacity concerning for pneumonia. 
 Nodular projection over the posterior right fifth rib correlates with
 deformity due to prior trauma, better depicted on the ___ chest CT. 
 A second opacity projects in the right upper lung adjacent to the overlying
 lead and may relate to the medical device though cannot definitively separate
 from the lung parenchyma.  Please correlate with direct visualization of lead.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  Stable thoracic spine fusion
 hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Nodular opacity over the fifth right posterior rib correlates with
 deformity due to fracture seen on chest CT.
 3.  Second nodular focus in the right upper lung likely relates to overlying
 medical device/EKG lead though cannot definitively separate from lung
 parenchyma.  Please correlate with visual inspection.  No definite correlate
 seen in the lung on subsequent chest CT from this same date, ___.
