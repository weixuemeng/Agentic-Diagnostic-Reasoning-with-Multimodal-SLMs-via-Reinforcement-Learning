                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with the right lung crackles, evaluate for residual pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and left-sided AICD device with
 electrodes and epicardial leads in unchanged positions.  Heart size remains
 mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to prior.  Previously
 noted opacification in the right middle and lower lobes has improved with
 minimal residual patchy opacities in these regions.  A small right pleural
 effusion is likely unchanged.  The left lung remains clear.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving right middle and lower lobe opacities compatible with resolving
 pneumonia.  No new focal consolidation.  Similar trace right pleural effusion.
