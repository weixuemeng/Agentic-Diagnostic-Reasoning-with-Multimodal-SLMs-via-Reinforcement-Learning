                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tachybrady syndrome after dual-chamber pacemaker
 placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Bibasal linear opacities might reflect interstitial
 lung disease, although crowdness of the vessels is another possibility.
 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle with no discontinuity seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal but it might be related to low lung
 volumes.
