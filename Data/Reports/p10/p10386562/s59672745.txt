                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild tortuosity of
 the aorta and multiple calcified plaques.  This probably accounts for the
 apparent parenchymal opacifications, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 On the lateral view, there appear to be small bilateral pleural effusions.
