                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shoulder pain, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 PICC is again seen, terminating in the right atrium.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again seen.  Additional
 perihilar opacities are seen, left greater than right, raising concern for
 underlying pulmonary edema which may be asymmetric.  Underlying infection is
 not excluded, particularly in the left lung.  Patchy left base opacity may
 relate to prominent vascular structures and/or atelectasis, although
 underlying infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities projecting over the bilateral lung fields, in part
 relating to calcified pleural plaques, although increased perihilar opacities
 compared to the prior study, left greater than right, raise concern for
 pulmonary edema with possible underlying infection, as above.
