                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and a chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness and altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Extensive
 calcified pleural plaque projects over both lungs, limiting evaluation
 somewhat.  Lung volumes are also quite low which limits evaluation.  Allowing
 for this, there is no gross sign of infection, large effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive pleural plaque limits evaluation.  Allowing for this,
 no obvious signs of infection.
