                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal contour is
 stable, with marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Bilateral
 calcified pleural plaques somewhat limit assessment of the pulmonary
 parenchyma.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 definitively noted.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Calcified pleural plaques compatible with prior asbestos exposure.  No new
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
