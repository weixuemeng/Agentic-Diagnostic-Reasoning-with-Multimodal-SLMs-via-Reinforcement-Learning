                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with questionable right middle lobe
 pneumonia, diagnosed in rehabilitation on ___.  Check for resolution of
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest films were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next previous chest examination in our
 records dated ___.  The heart is not markedly enlarged.  Thoracic
 aorta is generally widened and elongated but no local contour abnormalities
 are identified.  Some calcium deposits are seen in the wall at the level of
 the arch.
 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the lateral pleural sinuses are
 free.  Similarly as seen on previous examinations, there are multiple pleural
 calcified plaques obscuring some of the pulmonary areas but again acute
 parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  On the lateral view the
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Thus, there is no evidence of any pleural
 effusion.  As regards to the suspected right middle lobe pneumonia diagnosed
 at another institution, conclusive statement can not be made.  It is however
 observed that on our chest examinations there were some scar formations in the
 right cardiophrenic angle as well as some overlying pleural plaques that might
 have resulted in this diagnosis. Based upon the present examination and 
 comparison with our previous study there is no evidence of any acute ongoing
 pneumonia and the patient is not congested.
