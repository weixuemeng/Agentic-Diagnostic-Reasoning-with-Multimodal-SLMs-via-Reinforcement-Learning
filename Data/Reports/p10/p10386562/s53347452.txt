                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes which accentuates the heart size, which is likely
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques limit assessment of
 the underlying pulmonary parenchyma.  There is a focal opacity noted within
 the left lung base, which could reflect an area of atelectasis or infection,
 but is nonspecific.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm anteriorly is
 chronic. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection
 in the correct clinical setting.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques
 compatible with prior asbestos exposure.
