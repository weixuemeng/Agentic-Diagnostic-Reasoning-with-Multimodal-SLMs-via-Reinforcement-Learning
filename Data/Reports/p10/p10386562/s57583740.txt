                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, fell 4 days ago with history of CML and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest radiograph and ___ CT chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are re-
 demonstrated which somewhat limit assessment of the lung parenchyma.  Heart
 size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Superior mediastinal widening is
 unchanged, and attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis as well as a large
 right thyroid nodule.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis and/or
 scarring.  Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior study.  There is no
 new focal consolidation is demonstrated, or overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis or scarring.  Low lung volumes.  Calcified
 bilateral pleural plaques.  No definite new areas of focal consolidation is
 identified.
