                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pancreatitis, now status post
 chest tube placement, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained five hours earlier during the same day.  A right-sided pigtail
 and drainage tube has been placed through the right lower lateral chest wall
 and terminates in right-sided supradiaphragmatic position.  Observe that the
 line appears kinked a few centimeters proximal to the pigtail end.  This
 finding could indicate obstruction of the line.  Comparison with the next
 previous study, the absence of any drainage line, the at that time existing
 massive right-sided pleural effusion has cleared up almost completely. 
 Evidence of left-sided pleural effusion has increased in comparison with the
 next previous study. Quantitation of fluid, however, appears uncertain as more
 or less increased patient's tilt vary position of fluid.  The patient remains
 intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The position of the left-sided internal
 jugular approach central venous line is unchanged and terminates in the mid
 portion of the SVC at the level of the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided pigtail drainage catheter placed in lower pleura with
 apparently effective drainage.  Unusual appearance of pigtail catheter raises
 suspicion for mechanical obstruction related to kink.  Clinical correlation
 recommended.  Referring physician, ___ was paged at 5:25 p.m.
