                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ?PNA, intubated // Assess for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph dated ___.  Correlation made to
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. The ET tube ends just
 below the clavicles. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, tip not
 visualized. There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral airspace opacities are
 improved at the right base. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection. Stable retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due
 to atelectasis or infection. A small left layering pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in bilateral airspace opacities, particularly at
 the right base, which may be due to resolving multifocal pneumonia.
 
 Stable layering small left pleural effusion.
