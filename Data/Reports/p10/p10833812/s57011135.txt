 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.4 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube tip courses through the stomach, off the inferior borders of the
 film.  Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours unremarkable.
 Diffuse ill-defined alveolar opacities are noted bilaterally. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam however the right
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
