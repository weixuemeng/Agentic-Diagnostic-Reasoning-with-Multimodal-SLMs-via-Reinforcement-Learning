                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Swelling.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images available.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 though the pulmonary vessels are essentially within normal limits.  There is a
 pleural effusion on one side seen on lateral view, most likely the left.  No
 definite focal pneumonia.  Evidence of previous CABG procedure and a
 prosthetic left humerus in place.
 
 This study is somewhat limited due to scattered radiation related to the size
 of the patient.
