                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the nasogastric tube
 is in the upper-to-mid body of the stomach.  The side port is probably just
 below the level of the esophagogastric junction.
 
 Non-specific bowel gas pattern.  If there is serious clinical concern for
 obstruction, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
