                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing white count and tachypnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the low
 lung volumes, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  The apparent poor
 definition of the right hemidiaphragm on the lateral view could be artifactual
 or reflect some crowding of vessels.
