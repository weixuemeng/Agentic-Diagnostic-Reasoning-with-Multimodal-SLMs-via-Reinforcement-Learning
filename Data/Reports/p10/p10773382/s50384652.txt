 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:17 PM
  Low lung volumes. Biapical pleural thickening. No focal consolidation, pleural
  effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Calcification projecting over left
  ventricle again noted. Hemodialysis catheter in similar position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis and fever, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ and at an
 outside institution on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral  radiographs of the chest show persistently low
 inspiratory lung volumes.  Mild biapical pleural thickening is unchanged.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  Mild
 mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement is noted.  Mildly increased
 interstitial lung markings are equivocal for mild pulmonary edema in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with
 ring shadowing at the cardiac apex suggestive of myocardial calcification
 which could be related to aneurysm formation or prior myocardial infarction. 
 The thoracic aorta is slightly unfolded and heavily calcified, particularly
 along the descending portion.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 with prominence of the azygos vein.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with wires intact and multiple surgical clips projecting along the
 left cardiac border consistent with prior cardiac surgery.  A left
 supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter is unchanged in position with
 the tip terminating in the right atrium.  Surgical clips are noted in the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Mild mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly with possible calcification at the cardiac
 apex suggesting aneurysm formation or prior myocardial infarction.
 4.  Findings equivocal for mild pulmonary edema in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No pleural effusions.
