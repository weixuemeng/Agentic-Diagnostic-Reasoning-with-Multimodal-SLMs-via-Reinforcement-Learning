 INDICATION:  Left chest wall tenderness along the mid clavicular line at the
 second through fourth ribs.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  No definite rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 concern for a rib fracture, further evaluation could be performed with a
 dedicated rib series, including an appropriately positioned radiopaque skin
 marker.
