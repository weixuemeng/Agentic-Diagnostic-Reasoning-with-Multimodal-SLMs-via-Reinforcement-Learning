                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are diffusely
 increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, slightly more prominent
 at the left upper lung laterally.  There is no large confluent consolidation
 nor effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Coronary
 artery stents are noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs. 
 This could represent atypical infection, although chronic underlying lung
 disease is also possible.  Please correlate with patient's history and onset
 of symptoms.  CT scan may offer additional detail.
