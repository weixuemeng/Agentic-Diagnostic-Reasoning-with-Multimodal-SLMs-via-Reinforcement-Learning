                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Community-acquired pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again is prominence of
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs in a patient with cardiac
 silhouette at the upper limits of normal in size.  This could well represent
 pulmonary vascular congestion or diffuse interstitial infiltrate such as a
 viral pneumonia.  As on the recent CT scan, there is some fullness in the
 region of the AP window consistent with reactive enlarged lymph node.  An area
 of increased opacification is again seen in the upper left lung laterally,
 which could be a focus of consolidation.
