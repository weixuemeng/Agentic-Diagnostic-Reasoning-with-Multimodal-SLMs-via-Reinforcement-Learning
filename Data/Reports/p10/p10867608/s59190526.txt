                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with AML status post bone marrow transplant, now
 with fever and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates progression of
 right lower lung consolidation, concerning for pneumonia. There is a small
 right-sided pleural effusion.  The differential between the right and left
 hemi-diaphragms is stable.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  A supraclavicular subclavian central line ends
 in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of right lower lobe consolidation should be
 considered pneumonia until proven otherwise.
