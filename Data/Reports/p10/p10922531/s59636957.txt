 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with asthma, afib on pradaxa, CHF (EF unknown),
 prostate cancer in remission with recent chf exacerbation at ___ c/b
 diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis resulting in pneumothorax which had been

 The large right apical lateral pneumothorax persists and is overall unchanged
 since the prior exam, now with a uppermost portion of aerated lung projecting
 over the fifth posterior right rib.  Associated relaxation atelectasis,
 particularly of the right lower lobe is overall unchanged.  The right pigtail
 catheter projects over the right lower hemithorax at the costophrenic angle,
 unchanged.  Small right pleural effusion is new.  No change in the appearance
 of the left lung, including no effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.
 No edema.  Heart is normal in size.  Mediastinum is not widened.  Anterior
 cervical vertebral fixation hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No significant interval decrease in the size of the right large apical
 lateral pneumothorax.  Consideration of placing a larger chest tube is
 recommended.
