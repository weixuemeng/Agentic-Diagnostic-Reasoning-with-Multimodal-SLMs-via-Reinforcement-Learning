                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 The small apical component of right pneumothorax is unchanged, but there has
 been an increase in fluid and air loculations in the right lower chest.  I
 presume that these are in the pleural space, despite the indwelling right
 pleural drainage catheter, but it is conceivable that some reside in large
 air-filled spaces in the lung such as bullae or cavities.  CT scanning would
 be required to make that differentiation, and even if the air and fluid are in
 the pleural space, CT would be valuable to localize the position of the
 pleural drainage catheter to the undrained pleural space.  .
 
 Left lung is hyperinflated but clear.  The heart is top- normal size given the
 large lung volumes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CT.
