                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Mesenteric ischemia and bowel perforation status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  The nasogastric tube appears to end
 in the distal esophagus.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the
 mid superior vena cava.  The chest is hyperinflated with an attenuated
 appearance of lung markings in the upper lungs most suggestive of emphysema. 
 There are persistent opacities in both lower lungs, more extensive on the left
 than the right.  Small effusions are suspected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent focal opacities at the lower lobes that persist,
 compatible with atelectasis although pneumonia is not excluded.  Small
 suspected pleural effusions.
