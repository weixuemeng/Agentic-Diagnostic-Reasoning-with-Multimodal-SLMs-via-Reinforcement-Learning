                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:09 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral pneumothorax after duodenal
 perforation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 4:31 a.m.:
 
 Bilateral pneumothorax, at least moderate in volume, probably underestimated
 on supine view, are unchanged since 4:31 a.m., possible larger on the right
 compared to 2:56 a.m.  Small bore, biapical, intended pleural drainage
 catheters have not changed in position; the distal portion of the right tube
 is still extrathoracic and the intrapleural location of each is not really
 confirmed by a single frontal radiograph.  Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous
 emphysema, and free subdiaphragmatic gas are grossly unchanged.  ET tube in
 standard placement.  Mild to moderate bibasilar atelectasis stable.  Heart
 size top normal. 
 
 I discussed all of these findings, including my questions about the position
 of pleural drains, with Dr ___, by telephone, at 9:30 a.m. on ___.
