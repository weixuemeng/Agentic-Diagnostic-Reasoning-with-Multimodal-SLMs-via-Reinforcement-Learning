 WET READ: ___ ___ 3:45 AM
  Bilateral chest tubes are in place.  The left tube is at the periphery and
  there is a persistent large left pneumothorax.  The small right pneumothorax
  continues to decrease in size and the right chest tube is more optimally
  positioned.  The endotracheal tube is close to the carina and should be pulled
  back 2-3 cm. There is persistent small pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum,
  and extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  d/w Dr. ___ by phone ___ at 3:35

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.  Please note that the
 original dictation for this study was lost and this study again became
 available for dictation on PACS on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given patient positioning and difference in phase of respiratory
 cycle, there is no significant change compared to prior examination with
 redemonstration of moderate bilateral pneumothoraces with biapical chest tubes
 in place.  The left apical chest tube appears in satisfactory position in the
 left apex; however, the tip of the right chest tube is in questionable
 position appearing to overlay the soft tissues.  Extensive pneumopericardium,
 pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema leading to the
 cervical soft tissues are all unchanged from prior study.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The lungs are essentially
 clear without focal consolidation.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  An
 NG tube is in place in proper position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared to prior examination with
 persistent bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum,
 pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.  The right chest tube remains in
 questionable position with the tip projecting over the soft tissues.
