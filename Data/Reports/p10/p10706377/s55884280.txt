 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low.  There is diffuse prominence of interstitial
 markings. There is no pneumothorax. The heart appears large although cardiac
 size may be exaggerated by AP technique.  Mediastinal structures are otherwise
 unremarkable. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

 Diffuse prominence of interstitial markings that may represent edema.  No
 focal consolidation.
