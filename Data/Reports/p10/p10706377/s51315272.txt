                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pneumothorax with chest
 tube on waterseal
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the ET tube and NG tubes have been removed.  A
 right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal most SVC near the confluence
 with the subclavian.  Left-sided chest tube remains present.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 Knee cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but unchanged and likely
 accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Patchy opacity at both lung bases is similar to the prior film could be
 accounted for by atelectasis, but an associated pneumonic infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Mild vascular moderate vascular plethora is likely accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
