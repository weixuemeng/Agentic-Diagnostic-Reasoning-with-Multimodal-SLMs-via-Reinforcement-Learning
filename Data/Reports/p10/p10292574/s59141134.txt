                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AFib, RVR, pleuritic chest pain, recent fall, question
 fracture or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged, though this is stable.  Patient is slightly rotated to the
 left on the frontal radiograph, which limits evaluation.  There is no focal
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No signs of CHF, no effusion and no
 pneumothorax.  A calcified nodular opacity in the left upper lung is stable
 and likely represents a calcified granuloma.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
