                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is
 within the stomach with the side port in the distal esophagus, superior to the
 gastroesophageal junction. Heart size is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  Perihilar and upper lobe hazy opacities may reflect
 pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion is likely, with the right
 costophrenic angle and lateral aspect of the right hemithorax excluded from
 the field of view. No large pneumothorax is identified.  Retrocardiac
 consolidative opacity is nonspecific, possibly pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Left-sided rib fractures appear acute. Remote right-sided rib fractures also
 noted. The stomach is distended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal tube. Enteric tube tip needs to be
 advanced for appropriate positioning within the stomach.
 2. Exclusion of the right costophrenic angle and right lateral chest.
 Pulmonary edema with small left pleural effusion. Retrocardiac consolidative
 opacity, possibly pneumonia or aspiration.
