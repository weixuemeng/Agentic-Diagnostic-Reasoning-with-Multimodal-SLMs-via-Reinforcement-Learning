                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right lower flank pain over the costal margin, status post fall,
 evaluation for abnormalities and rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, neither the frontal nor the
 lateral view are of substantial differences.  The lung volumes are normal. 
 There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, better seen on the
 lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The abnormality is caused by a small
 pleural effusion.  This effusion could tentatively be caused by a subtle rib
 fracture in the lateral aspects of the eighth right rib.  The fracture is not
 substantially displaced.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Calcified
 granuloma in the left lung apex is unchanged.  No hilar or mediastinal
 abnormalities.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the referring physician, ___. ___,
 2:08 p.m., on ___, was paged for notification.
