                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute-on-chronic worsening bilateral chest pain at midclavicular
 line, both above and below breast.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and
 normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There are chain sutures in the
 right upper and middle lobes from prior wedge resection.  There are other
 linear scars in the right lower lobe, which are unchanged.  Median sternotomy
 cerclage wires are intact and surgical clips are seen in the mediastinum from
 prior CABG.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.  However, if there is continued
 clinical concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series with a skin marker
 at the location of the patient's pain is recommended as it is more sensitive
 than a chest radiograph.
