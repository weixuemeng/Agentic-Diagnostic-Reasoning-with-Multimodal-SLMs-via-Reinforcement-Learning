                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral lung infiltrates,
 evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Available for comparison is the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.
 
 The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No typical
 configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta of ordinary dimension but
 some calcium deposits in the wall are noted at the level of the arch. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exist bilateral centrally
 located infiltrates in the lower lobe areas known from previous CT torso
 examinations of ___.  Direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view portable chest examination of ___ indicates that
 these densities have regressed moderately in extension.  No new local
 pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Remarkable is that the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are now free from any fluid accumulation, which was
 not the case on the torso examination of ___.  No new pulmonary
 abnormalities are seen and no cavitation can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral scattered lower lobe infiltrates in regression,
 probably infectious in nature, now managed successfully in this
 imunosuppressed patient.
