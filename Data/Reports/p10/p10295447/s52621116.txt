                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD for pre kidney transplant eval  //
 r/o cardiopulmonary abnormalities
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new small bilateral pleural effusions.  New multifocal patchy
 opacities in bilateral lungs, most notably in right juxta hilar and bilateral
 mid and lower lungs, with combined peripheral and peribronchovascular
 distribution.  These findings are superimposed on pre-existing lung
 parenchymal abnormality is in the left mid and lower lung.  Cardiac silhouette
 is upper limits of normal size limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New multifocal alveolar and interstitial opacities in association with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 The differential diagnosis is broad and includes atypical distribution of
 pulmonary edema, opportunistic infection, or post transplant
 lymphoproliferative disorder.  Considering history of end-stage renal disease,
 short-term followup radiographs after dialysis may be helpful.  If findings
 fail to improve, chest CT is recommended for further characterization.
