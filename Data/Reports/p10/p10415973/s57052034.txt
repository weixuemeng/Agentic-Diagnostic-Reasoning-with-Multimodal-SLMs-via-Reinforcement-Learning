 There appears to be increased consolidation at the left lung base.  There is
 no large pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No definite rib fractures are
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New consolidation at the left lung base which may be secondary to atelectasis
 however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  No definite rib
 fractures are identified.  However if there is further clinical concern for
 rib fractures, a dedicated rib series would be recommended for further
 evaluation.
