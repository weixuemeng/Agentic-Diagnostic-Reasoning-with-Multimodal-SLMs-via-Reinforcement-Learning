 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hemodynamic instability, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement with
 reduction in extent of the right pleural effusion and increasing lung volumes,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  However, extent of a minimal left
 pleural effusion and of a relatively large left lower lobe atelectasis is
 constant.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged right PICC line.
