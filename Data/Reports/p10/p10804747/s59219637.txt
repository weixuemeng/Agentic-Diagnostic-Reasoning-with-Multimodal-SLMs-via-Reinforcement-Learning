                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and CHF with recent surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the hazy opacification at the
 right base has somewhat decreased.  It is unclear whether this represents
 improving effusion or possibly relates to the change in position of the
 patient.  Little change in the degree of opacification at the left base,
 consistent with effusion and underlying atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent lung with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.  The PICC line is unchanged.
