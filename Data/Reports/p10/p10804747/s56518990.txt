                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  There is increasing opacification at the left base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with worsening volume loss in left lower lobe with
 small pleural effusion.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
 
 Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.
