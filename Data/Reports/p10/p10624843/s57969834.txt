 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath. Probable influenza.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 The heart is normal in size. There is opacity in the left lower lobe
 suggesting pneumonia.  Anterior opacity on the lateral view probably probably
 localizes to the lingula, suggesting an additional area of pneumonia. The
 right lung appears clear.  There is no definite evidence for pleural effusion
 although a trace left-sided effusion is not excluded.

 Findings consistent with pneumonia in the left lower lobe and lingula.
 
 Follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution in approximately ___
 weeks.
