                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST WITH DECUB
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent LLL pneumonia, now with increasing
 left sided pleuritic pain, dullness ___ way up left chest on exam  // assess
 for left sided effusion     assess for left sided effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right pleural effusion has
 cleared.  Continued opacification at the left base is, though the
 hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with some clearing of the left
 lower lobe pneumonia. On the lateral decubitus view, there is no evidence of
 free pleural effusion on the left. This suggests a loculated pleural
 collection, possibly an empyema and. If further imaging is required, CT would
 be the next study.
