                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary
 hypertension with cough and dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles
 bilaterally is most suggestive of pleural thickening.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are seen as on prior.  There is no new consolidation, nor pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, similar to
 prior.  Degenerative changes are noted at the left shoulder as well as mild
 compression deformity of the mid thoracic spine, which is unchanged.  There is
 minimal opacity in the left mid lung projecting over the superior aspect of
 the cardiac shadow similar to prior and could represent scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
