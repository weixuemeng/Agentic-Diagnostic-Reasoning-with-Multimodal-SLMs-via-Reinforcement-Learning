                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Cough, fevers, chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Fullness of the right hilum appears unchanged. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 is unchanged and compatible with scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Scattered soft tissue calcifications are
 compatible with the patient's history of systemic sclerosis.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
