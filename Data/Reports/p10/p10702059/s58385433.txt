                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, cough, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral view is somewhat suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There is
 left base retrocardiac opacity with subtle suggestion of air bronchograms,
 worrisome for pneumonia.  There is also blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion.  There is stable minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Degenerative changes at the
 glenohumeral joints are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings worrisome for left lower lobe pneumonia with possible associated
 small left pleural effusion.  Recommend followup to resolution.
