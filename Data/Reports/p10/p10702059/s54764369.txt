                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar with enlargement of the right hilum appearing unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity is seen in the left
 lower lobe, as noted on the prior examinations, and likely reflective of
 chronic bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis and chronic
 aspiration.  No new focal consolidation is present.  No large pleural effusion
 is present with chronic blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus likely due
 to chronic pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Patient is status
 post bilateral shoulder arthroplasties, incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left lower lobe opacity, as seen on the previous exams, and likely
 reflective of chronic bronchiectasis with atelectasis and chronic aspiration,
 better detailed on the previous CT.  No new focal consolidation.
