                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup effusion.  The patient is status post cardiac
 surgery.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 The patient is very rotated, this limits the evaluation of the film.  Allowing
 this limitation, large bilateral pleural effusions have slightly decreased. 
 There is decrease in the bibasilar adjacent atelectasis.  Vascular congestion
 has improved.  Right suprahilar opacities are persistent.  Attention in
 followup is recommended.  This is worrisome for a developing infection. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiomegaly.
