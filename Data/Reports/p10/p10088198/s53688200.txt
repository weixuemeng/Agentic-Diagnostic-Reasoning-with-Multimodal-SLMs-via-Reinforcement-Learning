                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette
 size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small to moderate pleural effusions appear
 similar compared to the prior exams.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect compressive atelectasis.  Scarring within the lung apices is re-
 demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.
