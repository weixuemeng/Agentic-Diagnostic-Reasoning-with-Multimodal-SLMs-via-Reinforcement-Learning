                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:33
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old postop day ___ MV-AV mass excision.  Evaluate
 for effusion and pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 11:33 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post median sternotomy.  Markedly low lung volumes with bilateral
 moderate layering pleural effusions and associated bibasilar airspace disease
 which most likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  Crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess due to the markedly low lung volumes.  Small
 nodular opacities at the right apex seen on the study of ___ are again
 identified, but not changed.  A faint patchy pleural-based opacity in the left
 lateral chest may represent some loculated fluid.  No pneumothorax. 
 Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
