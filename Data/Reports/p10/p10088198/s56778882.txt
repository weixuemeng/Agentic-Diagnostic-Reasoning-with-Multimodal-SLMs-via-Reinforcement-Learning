 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac surgery, assessment for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is no evidence of
 pleural effusions.  The costophrenic sinuses are well deployed on both the
 frontal and the lateral image.  There is an area of increased radiodensity at
 the level of the right upper lobe, which is likely caused by the rotation of
 the patient following relatively severe scoliosis.
 
 No pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
