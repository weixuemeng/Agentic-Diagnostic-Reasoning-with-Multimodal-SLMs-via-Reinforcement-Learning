                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain radiation to back, atrial fibrillation with
 RVR, evaluate for mediastinal widening, cardiomegaly, free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. CT Chest ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Apparent slight enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in comparison to prior
 chest x-ray from ___ likely relates to lower lung volumes and AP
 technique.  The cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise stable and within
 normal limits, with unchanged aortic arch calcifications.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
