                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes most pronounced in the
 lung apices.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Previously noted nodules
 distributed in both lungs are better assessed on the prior CT.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No displaced
 fractures are seen.  Curvilinear lucency within the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen is compatible with gas within a colonic loop of bowel, and is not
 extraluminal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute traumatic injury identified.  No displaced rib fractures are seen,
 though if there is clinical concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series
 is noted.
 
 2. Emphysema.  Known multiple pulmonary nodules are better assessed on the
 prior CT.
