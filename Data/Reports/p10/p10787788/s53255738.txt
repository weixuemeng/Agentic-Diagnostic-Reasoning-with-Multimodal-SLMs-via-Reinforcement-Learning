                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, dry cough, and temperature.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and chest CT, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperexpanded, and
 there is a paucity of vasculature superiorly, consistent with known severe
 COPD.  Multifocal patchy interstitial opacities are seen predominantly at the
 mid lungs and lung bases.  Given the presence of a normal heart size and the
 absence of central venous vascular congestion, this is most consistent with
 multifocal pneumonia, perhaps aspiration.  There is no strong evidence for
 pulmonary edema.  The known right upper lobe spiculated mass is not well
 appreciated on this study.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal patchy interstitial opacities are seen predominantly
 at the mid lungs and lung bases.  Given the presence of a normal heart size
 and the absence of central venous vascular congestion, this is most consistent
 with multifocal pneumonia, perhaps aspiration.  Recommend follow-up to
 resolution.
 
 Known right upper lobe spiculated mass not well appreciated on this study.
 
 COPD.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 1:01 p.m. on ___
 by telephone at the time of discovery.
