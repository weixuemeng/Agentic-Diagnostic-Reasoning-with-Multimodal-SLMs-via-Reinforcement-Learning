                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Relative increased density of the left
 lung base is unchanged compared to multiple prior examinations and likely
 reflects chronic pleural thickening.  Lungs are otherwise clear without
 confluent consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No superimposed acute process.
