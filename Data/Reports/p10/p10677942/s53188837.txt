                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LUL nodules, ? present on CXR in ___.
 PA/LAT advised for comparison with ___ film  // eval LUL changes to compare
 with PA/Lat CXR in ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTs from ___ and ___ as well as multiple
 prior chest radiographs including ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 2 focal nodular left upper lobe opacities are again demonstrated and have been
 present radiographically since at least ___.  Is difficult to assess
 for subtle change over time due to positional and projectional differences
 between these exams, but there has not been a dramatic interval change during
 the long time interval.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2 left upper lobe nodular opacities have been present radiographically since ___ and are probably stable since that time.  Positional and projectional
 differences limit assessment for subtle change.  With this in mind, a 6 month
 followup CT may be helpful to confirm stability and to exclude an active
 process.
