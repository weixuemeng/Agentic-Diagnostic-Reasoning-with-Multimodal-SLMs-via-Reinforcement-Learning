 effusion, or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  No definite free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  To exclude free air
 under the right hemidiaphragm a true upright radiograph or CT could be
 performed.
 
 3.  Area of increased opacification projecting over the anterior left first
 rib may represent degenerative change, however a pulmonary process cannot be
