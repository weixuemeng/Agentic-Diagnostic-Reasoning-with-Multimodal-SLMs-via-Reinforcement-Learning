                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided demonstrating no
 focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.  A vague
 nodular opacity projects in the left mid lung between the eighth and ninth
 posterolateral arches, could represent a bone island or superimposed
 structures.  Consider oblique projections to clarify.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacity in the left mid lung seen on the frontal
 view projecting between the left eighth and ninth posterolateral arches could
 represent a bone island or superimposed structures, less likely a lung nodule.
 Recommend oblique projections to clarify.
