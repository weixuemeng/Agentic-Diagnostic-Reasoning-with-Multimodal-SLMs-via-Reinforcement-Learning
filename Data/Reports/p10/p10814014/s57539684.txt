 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain for one day.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left lung is mildly hyperinflated, which may reflect a mild
 bronchitis or asthma.  There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  No fracture is identified.  Irregularities along the anterior left
 lower ribs is likely at the junction of the rib and the costo-chondral
 cartilage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left lung hyperinflation, possibly from a bronchitis or
 asthma.  No evidence of a pneumothorax.
