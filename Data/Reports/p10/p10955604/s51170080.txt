                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with end stage liver disease, low platelet count
 and acute hypoxia  // Assess for worsening pneumonia or evidence of hemorrhage
 Assess for worsening pneumonia or evidence of hemorrhage
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ twenty-fifth most recently ___ through ___ at 14:54.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous consolidative and infiltrative abnormality in the right lung has
 worsened node dramatically since earlier in the day. The rapid change could be
 due to edema, cardiogenic or noncardiogenic, or pulmonary hemorrhage, but is
 unlikely due to worsening infection alone.  Left lung remains severely
 consolidated.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured, but mediastinal venous
 engorgement reflects elevated right heart pressure.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed but not large.  No pneumothorax.  .
