 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:12 PM
  In comparison to the prior there has been interval placement of an
  endotracheal tube which ends 1.0 cm above the carina and should be pulled back
  3.5 cm for more standard positioning.  The lung fields and cardiomediastinal
  silhouette are stable from the examination 1 hour prior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with end stage cirrhosis now s/p intubation for
 hypoxia  // Assess endotracheal intubation      Assess endotracheal intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 18:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina with the
 chin in neutral position.  Care should be taken that it not advance any
 further, or it can be withdrawn up to 15 mm.
 
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, which has been present in the left
 lung for several days worsened appreciably earlier in the day and a smaller
 region of consolidation at the right lung base which had developed between
 ___ and ___ worsened considerably in out lung over the course
 of the day.  With Intubation lung volumes have improved slightly and positive
 pressure probably accounts for mild improvement in the right lung.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No small to moderate left pleural effusion is likely.  Heart
 remains enlarged and the mediastinal veins are particularly distended
 suggesting elevated right heart pressure.
 
 Differential diagnosis as discussed previously includes progressive severe
 pneumonia, concurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and now, with involvement of the
 right lung, noncardiogenic edema.
