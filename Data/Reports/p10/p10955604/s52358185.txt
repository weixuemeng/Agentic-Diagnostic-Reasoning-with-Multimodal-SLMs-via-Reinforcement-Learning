                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // Eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is markedly asymmetric airspace opacity predominately affecting the left
 long.  While this may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is prominence of pulmonary vascular in the right lung
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive consolidation in the left lung may reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema but infection cannot be excluded.
