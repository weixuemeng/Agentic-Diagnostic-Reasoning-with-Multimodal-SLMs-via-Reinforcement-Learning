                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with hypoxia, evaluate for edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Surgical chain sutures are seen overlying the left mid lung. There is
 rightward rotation of the patient on the current examination. Allowing for
 changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal
 limits. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement and left greater than right
 diffuse interstitial prominence likely reflects asymmetric mild pulmonary
 edema, left greater than right.  More focal opacity within left lung apex may
 reflect superimposed infection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left greater than right mild asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Focal opacity within
 the left lung apex may reflect superimposed infection.
