                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GIB and intubation.  Confirm ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates approximately 3.0 cm from the carina.  Compared to prior,
 lung volumes are decreased and there is an increase in nodular interstitial
 opacities bilaterally, worse on the left.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 likely.  Previously described left nodularity near the aortic knob is
 obscured.  The heart size and mediastinum are difficult to evaluate, though
 likely enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema.
 ET tube in standard position.
