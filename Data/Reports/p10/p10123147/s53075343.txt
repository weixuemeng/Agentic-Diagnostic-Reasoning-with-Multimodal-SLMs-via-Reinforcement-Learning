                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Aspiration pneumonia, now with worsening respiratory status. 
 Please assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  The
 enteric catheter is coiled in the fundus of the stomach with the tip likely at
 the level of the gastroesophageal junction, heading cephalad.  Recommend
 repositioning particularly given aspiration event. Left-sided central venous
 catheter likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.
  On a background of mild pulmonary edema, multifocal bilateral airspace
 opacifications may represent alveolar edema versus multifocal pneumonia. 
 There is interval development of a left mid lung large opacification
 concerning for pneumonia/aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enteric catheter is coiled in the fundus of the stomach, terminating in
 the gastroesophageal junction with cephalad orientation.  Concern for
 increased risk of aspiration.  Recommend repositioning.
 2.  On a background of mild pulmonary edema and otherwise stable multifocal
 opacifications, there is a new large left mid lung opacification concerning
 for pneumonia/aspiration.
 
 ___ communicated findings to Dr ___ at 17:00 on ___
 via telephone at time of discovery.
