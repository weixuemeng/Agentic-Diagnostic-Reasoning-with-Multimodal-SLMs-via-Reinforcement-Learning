                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in place, with
 note of coiling of nasogastric tube in the proximal stomach, with distal tip
 directed cephalad in the region of the gastroesophageal junction.  Heart size
 remains normal.  Multifocal bilateral airspace consolidation has partially
 cleared, particularly within the lower lobes.  Residual opacities may be due
 to multifocal aspiration and/or developing infectious pneumonia.  Coexisting
 pulmonary edema is also possible.
