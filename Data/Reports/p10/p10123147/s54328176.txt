 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Streaky basilar densities, greater on the left than right,
 are most consistent with minor atelectasis.  There is no evidence for free
 air.
