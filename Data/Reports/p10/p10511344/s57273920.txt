 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal
 or mildly enlarged.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The right hemidiaphragm is not
 well seen, raising the possibility of small pleural fluid compressive
 atelectasis at the base.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen on the left.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
