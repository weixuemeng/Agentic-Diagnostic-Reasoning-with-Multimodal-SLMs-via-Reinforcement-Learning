 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p Right Superior Segmentectomy  // R/A POD#1

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New consolidation in the right lower lung. Because the right heart border is
 preserved I suspect this is in the postoperative right lower lobe, following
 segmentectomy. There is no right pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is
 new or newly apparent, right pleural drain still in place. Left lower lobe
 atelectasis is severe, progressed since ___. Left upper lung is grossly
 clear. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal veins are borderline engorged but
 there is no pulmonary edema.
