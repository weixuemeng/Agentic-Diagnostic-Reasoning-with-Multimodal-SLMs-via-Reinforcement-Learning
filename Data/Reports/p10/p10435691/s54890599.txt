 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p sup seg RLL  // check interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the volume of the right lung has
 substantially increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. However, at
 the right lung base, a mild to moderate pleural effusion persists and there is
 subsequent atelectasis of the basal parenchymal components.  No pneumothorax
 is detected. Normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette with complete
 resolution of pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis, no evidence of
 parenchymal disease in the left lung.
