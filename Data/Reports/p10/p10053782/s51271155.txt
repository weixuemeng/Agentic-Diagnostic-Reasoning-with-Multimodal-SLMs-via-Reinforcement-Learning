                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with c/o gen weakness  // ? PNA       // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes contribute to crowding of the bronchovascular structures as
 well as bibasilar atelectasis. There are no focal consolidations worrisome for
 pneumonia. Cardiac size is borderline enlarged given the low lung volumes. No
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  No free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
