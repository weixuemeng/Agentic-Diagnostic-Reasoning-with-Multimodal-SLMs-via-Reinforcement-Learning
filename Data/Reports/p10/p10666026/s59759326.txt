                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated that
 might be consistent with emphysema/small airway disease/COPD.  Small amount of
 atelectasis at the left lung base is noted, but no overt pneumonia is seen. 
 Minimal amount of left pleural effusion can potentially be present with no
 definitive cause for that demonstrated.
