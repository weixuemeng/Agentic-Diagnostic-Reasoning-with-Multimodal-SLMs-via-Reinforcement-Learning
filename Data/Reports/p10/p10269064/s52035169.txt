                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with decreased breath sounds, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Low lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  Left
 basilar opacity is identified, potentially in part due to atelectasis. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear and there is no effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, potentially due to atelectasis given low
 lung volumes; however, infection is not excluded.  Clinical correlation
 suggested.
