                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic valve replacement, to assess for congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in this patient with intact midline sternal wires after cardiac
 surgery.  Some hyperexpansion of the lungs is seen with tortuosity of the
 aorta.  Coarse interstitial markings at the bases could reflect chronic
 pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.
