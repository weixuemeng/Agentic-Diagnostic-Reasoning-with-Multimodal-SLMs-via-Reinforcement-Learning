                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia after vomiting, question aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 8:59 a.m.
 
 Asymmetry in opacification of the lungs persists.  Left is relatively clear. 
 The right shows edema, and there is a small right pleural effusion, layering
 posteriorly.  It is possible that these are changes due to aspiration, but
 asymmetric distribution of edema is another possibility, sometimes due to
 patient positioning.
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, but shifted leftward, without obvious cause.  No
 pneumothorax.  Relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is presumably due
 to eventration, but could reflect left upper quadrant pathology such as
 splenomegaly.  Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  Upper mediastinal widening
 has been present since at least ___, presumably due to fat deposition.
