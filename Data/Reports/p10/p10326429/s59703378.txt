                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 16:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intermittent hypoxia, question
 pulmonary edema or other pulmonary process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 06:17.
 
 Portable AP supine chest from ___ at 16:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of left subclavian PICC line, which has its tip in the
 proximal-to-mid SVC.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 due to marked patient rotation, but are likely unchanged.  Lung volumes appear
 somewhat diminished.  There is a possible increase in opacity at the left
 base, although this area is somewhat underpenetrated on the current
 examination but does raise concern for either partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Followup imaging would be advised.  In addition, the
 mild interstitial edema persists.
