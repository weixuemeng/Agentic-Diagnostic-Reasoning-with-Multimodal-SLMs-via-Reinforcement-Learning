                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History respiratory difficulties on CPAP.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia versus effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is technically limited.  Lungs are well expanded.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 prominence of interstitial markings which may reflect mild pulmonary edema. 
 The left mediastinum appears widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Widened left aspect of the mediastinum. Correlate clinically for aortic
 pathology and recommend repeat upright chest radiograph when feasible.
