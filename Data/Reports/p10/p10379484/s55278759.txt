                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is area of opacity projecting over the right middle lobe
 consistent with chronic right middle lobe atelectasis.  There appears to be
 thickening of the right major fissure, unclear whether a small amount of fluid
 is within or whether it may in part relate to the chronic right middle lobe
 collapse, although the opacity extends somewhat posterior.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Chronic right middle lobe atelectasis,
 adjacent new consolidation is difficult to exclude, although one is not
 definitively seen.  Thickening of the right major fissure seen on the lateral
 view which may in part relate to the right middle lobe collapse, although
 component of trace fluid within is not excluded.
 
 There is chronic deformity at the left shoulder and areas of ossification
 partially imaged, grossly similar to prior, related to synovial
 osteochondromatosis as seen on prior radiograph from ___.
