                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?LLL pna and parapneumonic effusion on OSH
 CT abd/pelvis  // any e/o PNA or effusion?
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside scanned-in chest x-ray dated ___ at 19:57 from
 ___ and___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.
 
 Heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged.  The pulmonary hila are both
 slightly prominent, similar to prior.
 
 There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Mild vascular plethora may relate to low inspiratory volumes.  Doubt overt
 CHF.
 
 Some  patchy right infrahilar opacity most likely represents atelectasis. 
 However, an early infiltrate or area of aspiration could have a similar
 appearance.
 
 There is possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle with
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion
 in the right lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the left base.
 Appearances similar to ___ but the effusion may be very slightly
 smaller and there is slight improvement in the degree of retrocardiac
 aeration.
 
 Minimal atelectasis and possible minimal costophrenic angle blunting at the
 right base is new.
 
 Patchy right infrahilar opacity is slightly more pronounced than on ___.  While this likely represents atelectasis, the differential diagnosis
 could include an early infiltrate or area of aspiration.
