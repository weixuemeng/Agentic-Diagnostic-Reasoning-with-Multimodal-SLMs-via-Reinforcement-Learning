 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, rule out pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 left thoracocentesis.  The extent of the left effusion has moderately
 decreased.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The remaining effusion on
 the left is still substantial, presence of a right pleural effusion, that is
 overall small, cannot be excluded.
