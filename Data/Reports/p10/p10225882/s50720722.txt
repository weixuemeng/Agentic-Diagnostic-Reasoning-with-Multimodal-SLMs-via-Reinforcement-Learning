 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of follicular lymphoma, status post thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 left thoracocentesis.  There is a minimal decrease in extent of the
 pre-existing left pleural effusion.  However, as seen on the lateral
 radiograph, there are still bilateral pleural effusions of moderate extent. 
 The radiograph shows no evidence of pneumothorax.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
