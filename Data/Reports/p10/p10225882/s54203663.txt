                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain and fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small left pleural effusion, increased since the prior study, with
 overlying atelectasis.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may relate to
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity may relate to a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.
