                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with Pleurx line, evaluate for effusion
 and interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Mild cardiac enlargement with relative left ventricular contour
 prominence and generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta as before.  No
 evidence of acute pulmonary congestion with interstitial or central edema. 
 The right-sided pleural sinus remains free.  On the left side, the previously
 described pleural density obliterating the lateral pleural sinus remains
 completely unchanged.  Lateral view confirms again the presence of pleural
 effusion in the pleural sinus, obliterating the presence of a normal
 left-sided posterior pleural sinus.  No pneumothorax can be identified.
