 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Follicular lymphoma, malignant pleural effusions, ascites.
 
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the effusion on the left has
 minimally decreased.  On the right, no effusion is visible.  However, there
 might be a minimal amount of subpulmonary pleural effusion.  The linear
 lucency at the lung base on the right, however, better seen on the lateral
 than on the frontal radiograph, however, is likely to represent free
 intra-abdominal air.  If there was no interventional procedure such as taping
 of the ascites or other, then intestinal perforation must be suspected.
