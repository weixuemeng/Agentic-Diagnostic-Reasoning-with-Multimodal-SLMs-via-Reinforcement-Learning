                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum appear
 unchanged since the prior examination, grossly reflecting only mild cardiac
 enlargement.  Left lower lobe and mid lung opacity appears to be progressed
 since the prior study and might reflect worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema
 or more likely infectious process potentially in combination with aspiration. 
 High position of the right hemidiaphragm is redemonstrated.
