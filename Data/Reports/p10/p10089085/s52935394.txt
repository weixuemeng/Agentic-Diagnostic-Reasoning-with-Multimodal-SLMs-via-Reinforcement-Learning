                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with multifocal
 consolidations.
 
 AP chest radiograph

 combination of radiation if obtained or removal of the bronchial stent.  Rest
 of the lungs are essentially clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
