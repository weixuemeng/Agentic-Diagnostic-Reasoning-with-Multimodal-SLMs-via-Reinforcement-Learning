 of inspiratory lung volumes with apparent increase of radiodensity throughout
 lungs bilaterally. There has been interval improvement of multilobar opacities
 along both lungs.  No new consolidations are identified. There is no
 pneumothorax. There has been interval removal of right main stem bronchus
 stent. Tracheostomy tube has a vertical course, no tube component that clearly
 reaches down the trachea is identified.
