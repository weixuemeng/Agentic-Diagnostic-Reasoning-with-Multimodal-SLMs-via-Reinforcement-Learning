                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lung cancer, status post right main stem bronchial stent. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.  An enteric
 catheter is visualized only to the level of the thoracic inlet, likely
 obscured more distally due to underpenetration of this radiograph.  A metallic
 stent within the right main stem bronchus appears appropriately positioned.  A
 left internal jugular central venous catheter ends at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins, not significantly changed.  A right superior
 mediastinal mass extends to the right hilus, not significantly changed.  Fluid
 within the minor fissure is increased.  There is mild-to-moderate bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Small layering pleural effusions may be present, not
 significantly changed.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is not
 significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
 
 4.  Incompletely assessed enteric catheter, only visualized to the level of
 the thoracic inlet.  Recommend conventional PA and lateral radiographs on
 future studies to improve visualization.
