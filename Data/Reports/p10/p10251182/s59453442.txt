                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is interval development of
 asymmetric mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left.  Alternatively, this
 could be a symmetric pulmonary edema with a right lower lobe pneumonia, but
 this is less likely.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acute asymmetric pulmonary edema, right greater than left, more
 likely than mild edema and concurrent right pneumonia.
