 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, possibly syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle is unchanged.  The heart size remains normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcifications again noted
 at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic angle on
 the lateral view, which may be due to chronic pleural thickening.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bilateral breast
 implants are noted.  There are multilevel mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Remote fracture of the left 6th rib posteriorly is re-
 demonstrated.
