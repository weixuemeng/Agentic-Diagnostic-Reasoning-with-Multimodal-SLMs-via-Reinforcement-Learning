                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT torso performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  Bilateral perihilar fullness
 and patchy upper lobe opacities appear similar to the prior CT torso scout
 view, allowing for differences in technique.  Surgical clips project along the
 right lateral chest wall.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar chronic abnormalities with no definite superimposed acute
 process.
