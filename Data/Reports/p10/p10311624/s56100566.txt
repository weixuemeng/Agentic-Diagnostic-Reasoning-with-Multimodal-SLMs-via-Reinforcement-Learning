                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from earlier on the same day performed at___, as scanned into the ___ PACS system.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 triangular opacity projecting over the lower anterior thorax on the lateral
 view is suggestive of partial opacification of the right middle lobe, although
 quite possibly due to atelectasis.  A very vague opacity with peribronchial
 cuffing, however, projects over the left mid lung, probably referring to the
 lingular region and concerning for incipient pneumonia.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague asymmetric opacification of the left mid lung, concerning
 for developing pneumonia within the lingula.  Correlation with physical
 findings and symptoms is recommended.  Short-term follow-up chest radiographs
 may be helpful to assess further if clinically indicated.
