                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly, with worsening congestive heart failure
 manifested by pulmonary vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness, and
 widespread septal thickening.  An apparent focal rounded area of consolidation
 is seen in the left upper lob ein the juxtahilar region at the level of the
 left third anterior rib, but is difficult to assess due to an overlying
 external monitoring lead at this site.  Persistent bilateral small pleural
 effusions are present.  Note is made of previous median sternotomy and
 coronary artery bypass surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening congestive heart failure with increasing interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Focal opacity in left upper lobe. Followup radiographs after diuresis may
 be helpful to distinguish an asymmetrical area of edema from a focal
 pneumonia.
