                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough and recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mild cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated, unchanged.  Aorta is diffusely calcified, and the mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar.  Mild pulmonary edema is minimally improved
 from the previous study with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions,
 larger on the left.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  Ovoid focal opacity within the left mid lung field appears to
 reflect fluid loculated posteriorly in the major fissure on the left on the
 lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, minimally improved from the previous study with small
 bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Small amount of fluid is
 loculated within the left major fissure posteriorly.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
