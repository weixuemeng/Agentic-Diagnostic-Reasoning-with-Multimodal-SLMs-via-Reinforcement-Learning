                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anginal pain, shortness of breath, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is stable and top normal.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions, grossly stable compared to the prior study.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary edema remains.  Additionally, left upper lung
 hazy opacity persists.  Increased right basilar atelectasis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions with increased
 atelectasis at the right base.  Persistent left upper lobe opacity, consistent
 with pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
