                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.  Reference
 made to CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  A
 subtle opacity projecting over the left mid lung may correspond to previously
 seen pulmonary nodule. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is right
 paratracheal soft tissue density which well could represent prominent vascular
 structures, underlying lymphadenopathy is of concern.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation. Subtle nodular opacity projecting over
 left mid lung likely corresponds to previously seen pulmonary nodule.
 
 Right paratracheal soft tissue density which may represent prominent vascular
 structures and may be similar in appearance to PET-CT scout radiograph from
 ___, although difficult to compare different modalities, findings raise
 concern for underlying lymphadenopathy.
