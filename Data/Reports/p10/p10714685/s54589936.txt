                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M from SNF with hypoxia, fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated
 with dense mitral annular calcifications.  Aortic knob calcifications are also
 re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Consolidative
 opacity in the right lung base, along with probable patchy retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Assessment of the left apex is obscured by
 external devices.  Remote posterior rib fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the right, concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration.
