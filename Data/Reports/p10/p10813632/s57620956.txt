                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with OG tube  // OG tube placement      OG tube
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
 orogastric tube that extends to the mid to lower body of the stomach. 
 Otherwise, little change with low lung volumes and opacification at the left
 base. This most likely represents a combination of volume loss in the lower
 lobe and pleural effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
