                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IN O.R.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated, new OG tube placement  // confirm OG
 tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest; ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP intraoperative view of the chest provided.
 
 An ETT is noted terminating 2.7 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low with
 worsened bibasilar atelectasis.  A curvilinear opacity overlying the proximal
 trachea at the cervicothoracic junction, may represent a malpositioned
 orogastric tube given the history of orogastric tube placement and lack of
 visualization of the tube below this level.  Of note, the subsequent chest
 radiograph shows an appropriately positioned OG tube. There is no effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Curvilinear opacity overlying the proximal trachea, which likely
 represents a malpositioned OG tube. Of note, on the subsequent chest
 radiograph, ___, an appropriately positioned OG tube is noted,
 suggesting interval repositioning.
 
 1. ETT tube is appropriately positioned.
 
 2. Low lung volumes with mildly worsened bibasilar atelectasis.
