                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage and fever.  Question.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier outside film from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky opacities at the right lung
 base suggests minor atelectasis. There is suspected vague new retrocardiac
 opacity, with low lung volumes, probably due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy suspected retrocardiac opacity, not specific and probably compatible
 with atelectasis; etiologies such as developing pneumonia or aspiration
 pneumonitis are not excluded, however.  The opacity does not appear extensive.
 Evaluation with short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered.
