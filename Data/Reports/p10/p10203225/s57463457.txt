                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Catheter lysis for PE, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. 
 Some prominence of central pulmonary vessels could reflect pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in
 the lower lobe.
