                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with seizures, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day performed at___
 ___.  Endotracheal tube is seen and has been slightly withdrawn and is
 now located approximately 1.5 cm from the carina.  There has been re-expansion
 of the left lung, likely due to atelectasis given prior right mainstem
 intubation.  There is some persistent hazy left-sided parenchymal opacity,
 potentially due to persistent atelectasis.  Patchy right basilar opacity is
 also seen.  NG tube passes below the diaphragm with tip in the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube 1.5 cm from the carina, withdrawn from the
 right mainstem bronchus with interval improved aeration of the left lung with
 some persistent left greater than right opacities.  These could be
 atelectasis, noting that infection cannot be excluded.
