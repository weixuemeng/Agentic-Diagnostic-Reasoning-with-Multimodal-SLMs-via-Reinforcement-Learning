                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Lung volumes
 are markedly low and patient is rotated, which limits evaluation
 significantly.  No convincing signs of pneumonia on this markedly limited
 exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is impossible to assess.  No large
 pneumothorax or effusion.  Deformity of the right humeral head appears
 chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam without convincing signs of pneumonia. 
 Would recommend repeat exam if there is further clinical concern.
