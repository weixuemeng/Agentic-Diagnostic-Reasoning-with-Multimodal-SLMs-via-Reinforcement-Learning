                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Incidental note is again made
 of an azygos fissure, consistent with a normal variant.  There is a patchy
 left basilar opacity, predominantly in the left lower lobe, which is
 nonspecific but probably compatible with atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  A deformity
 involving the course of the right lateral seventh rib appears unchanged and
 may be due to remote prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity, new but probably compatible with
 atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is suggested, however.
