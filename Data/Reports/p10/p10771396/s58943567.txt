                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, question pneumothorax status post chest tube
 removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 17:35 p.m.
 
 Since the prior film, ET and NG tubes, right IJ line, mediastinal drains and
 left chest tube have been removed.  Possibility of a small pneumothorax along
 the medial aspect of the lung cannot be excluded, but no definitive
 pneumothorax is identified.  No gross effusion is identified.  Some
 parenchymal changes are noted at the site of the chest tube, possibly a local
 contusion/hematoma.  
 
 Retrocardiac density is again noted.  Some atelectasis and patchy opacity at
 the right base is also seen, slightly worse compared with the earlier film. 
 Doubt CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval removal of left chest tube.  Some focal density at the previous
 site of the chest tube suggests some local contusion/hematoma. 
 
 2) Possibility of a small pneumothorax along the medial aspect of the left
 lung cannot be excluded, but no definitive pneumothorax is identified.  If
 clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to better define the presence of
 a non-apical pneumothorax.
 
 3) Slight increase in patchy opacity at right base.   No gross effusion.
