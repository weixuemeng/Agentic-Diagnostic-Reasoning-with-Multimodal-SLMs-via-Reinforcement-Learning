                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p CABG  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The extent of the pre-existing areas
 of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base has decreased. Also
 decreased are the small bilateral pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly
 remains. No pulmonary edema. A zone of parenchymal opacity surrounding the the
 left hilus is unchanged.  Normal alignment of the sternal wires. No
 pneumothorax.
