  Small left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening without focal
  consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
  Hyperinflation.
  Apparent focal density in the left mid lung. Nonurgent shallow obliques
  suggested to confirm this finding as superimposed shadows as opposed
  underlying pulmonary nodule.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is normal.  Calcification is noted of the aortic knob with mild
 unfolding of the descending thoracic aorta.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening.  There is no right pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Lungs are hyperexpanded with flattened
 hemidiaphragms and enlarged retrosternal air space, consistent with COPD.  No
 focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.  A small opacity in the left
 mid lung may represent superimposition of shadows.  The upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening without focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 Hyperinflation.
 Apparent focal density in the left mid lung.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonurgent shallow obliques suggested to confirm this
 finding as superimposed shadows as opposed underlying pulmonary nodule.
