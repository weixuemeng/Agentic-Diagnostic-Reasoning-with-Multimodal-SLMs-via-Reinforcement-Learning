                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been
 removed.  Cardiac silhouette appears less prominent and the pulmonary
 vascularity is essentially within normal limits.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 persist, more prominent on the left, with some compressive atelectasis at the
 base.
