                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest again demonstrate
 intact median sternotomy wires with surgical clips overlying the left heart
 border.  The moderate-sized left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is
 unchanged since the prior radiograph.  The remainder of the left lung
 parenchyma as well as the right lung is clear.  The cardiac contour is
 obscured by the pleural effusion and unchanged since the prior radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of moderate-sized left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis.
