                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CML, status post ERCP with suspected
 aspiration event, CXR overnight with multifocal consolidation, now rapidly
 improving, evaluate for pneumonia vs pneumonitis, amount of resolution from
 overnight xray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive airspace opacification within the left lung with minimal subpleural
 sparing has improved slightly compared with the immediate prior study but
 remains extensive.  There is similar airspace opacification of the medial
 right lung base with new subsegmental atelectasis adjacent to the minor
 fissure.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in extensive airspace opacity involving the left
 lung and medial right lung base, differential etiologies include aspiration,
 aspiration pneumonitis, or pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:56 PM, 1 minutes after
