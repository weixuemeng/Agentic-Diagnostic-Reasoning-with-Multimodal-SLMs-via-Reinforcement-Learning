                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for CHF or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable and lateral views of the chest are provided. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, although clear, without focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The apparent blunting of the right CP angle is
 stable as compared with multiple prior exams and likely reflects the
 hyperinflated status of the chest.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Tracheobronchial tree calcification is noted.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs without evidence of acute superimposed
 pathology.
