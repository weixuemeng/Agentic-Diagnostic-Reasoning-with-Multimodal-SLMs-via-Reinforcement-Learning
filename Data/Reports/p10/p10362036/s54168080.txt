                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever, question
 infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease/emphysema.  There is mild left base atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is a subtle opacity projecting over the lateral
 right upper lobe between the posterolateral right fifth and sixth ribs.  While
 this could be artifactual, underlying pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded and
 given history of emphysema, nonurgent chest CT is recommended.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  There is diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD/pulmonary emphysema.  Subtle increased opacity in the lateral right
 upper hemithorax, while may be artifactual, underlying pulmonary nodule cannot
 be excluded.  Given history of emphysema, nonurgent chest CT is recommended.
 2.  Mild left base atelectasis.
