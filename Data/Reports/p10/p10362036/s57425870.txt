                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a
 chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is a vague opacity in the left mid lung which could
 represent an early pneumonia.  Also a retrocardiac opacity seen on the frontal
 view is not corroborated on the lateral view.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the left mid lung could represent pneumonia.
 Followup to resolution.  Hyperinflated lungs again noted.
