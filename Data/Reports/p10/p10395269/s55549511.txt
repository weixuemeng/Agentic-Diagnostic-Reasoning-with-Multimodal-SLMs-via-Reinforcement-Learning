                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:29
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Motor vehicle accident.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect an overt interval change.
 
 AP supine view of the chest ___ at 7:29 with the patient on a trauma
 board was acquired.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Trauma board obscures detail.  Lung volumes are markedly low.  The patient is
 rotated, which likely accounts for the apparent mediastinal widening, but this
 can be further evaluated on followup imaging.  The heart is likely upper
 limits of normal in size.  No focal airspace consolidation is appreciated.  No
 large effusions.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  No displaced rib fracture
 is appreciated.  However, if this is of clinical concern, a dedicated rib
 series may be helpful.
