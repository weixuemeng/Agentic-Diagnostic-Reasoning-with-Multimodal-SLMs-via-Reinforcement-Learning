 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, weakness  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis is seen. The lung volumes are relatively low.
 Slight prominence of the interstitial markings may relate to vascular crowding
 from low lung volumes although minimal vascular congestion is not excluded. No
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Low lung volumes. Slight
 prominence of the interstitial markings most likely relates to vascular
 crowding from low lung volumes with of minimal vascular congestion not
 excluded.
