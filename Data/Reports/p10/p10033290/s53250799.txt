                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o unstable angina  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes limits the
 evaluation. Allowing for this, no focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The heart appears top-normal in size. Right hilar
 prominence is possibly due to suboptimal technique. Mediastinal contour
 appears normal. No bony abnormalities.
 
 Gas-filled bowel loops project below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hilar prominence could reflect bronchovascular crowding in the setting
 of lung volumes. Would recommend repeat exam with more optimized inspiratory
 effort.  Mild cardiomegaly.
