                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Indistince pulmonary markings could reflect some
 elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.  Patchy opacities in the right
 cardiophrenic angle partially obscure the right cardiac margin.  There are
 also patchy opacities in the left lung base projecting over the cardiac
 shadow. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac size cannot be
 properly evaluated in this supine exam.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Patchy opacities in the
 right middle lobe and left lung base raise concern for multifocal pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
