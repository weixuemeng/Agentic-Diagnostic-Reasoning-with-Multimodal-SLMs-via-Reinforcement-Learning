                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and chest pain.  Please assess for cardiomegaly or a
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest AP and lateral radiograph demonstrates normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Lung volumes are somewhat decreased
 compared to prior study, giving the appearance of prominent pulmonary
 vasculature, though this likely represents crowding.  No overt pulmonary edema
 identified.  Minimal atelectasis present in the bilateral lower lungs.  No
 pleural effusion identified.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.  No
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No cardiomegaly or pneumothorax
 evident.
