                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG and CAD with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and pulmonary vasculature, though even given technique there appears to be at
 least moderate cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion as well
 as mild interstitial edema.  There is likely a trace right-sided pleural
 effusion with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.  Concurrent infection cannot be
 excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with moderate cardiomegaly, central pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  Concurrent infection cannot
 be excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.
