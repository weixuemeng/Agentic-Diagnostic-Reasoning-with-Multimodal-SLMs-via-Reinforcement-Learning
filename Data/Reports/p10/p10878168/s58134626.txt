 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, rule out effusion and atelectasis.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The patient continues to show small bilateral
 pleural effusions, better seen on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists, but no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Better seen than on the previous image is a 1 to 2 mm
 post-operative left apical pneumothorax without any evidence of tension.
