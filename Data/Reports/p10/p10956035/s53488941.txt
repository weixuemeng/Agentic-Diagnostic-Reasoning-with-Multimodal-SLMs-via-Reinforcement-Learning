 Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump projects over the underside of the aortic
 knob, approximately 15 mm higher than it was yesterday.  This could be due to
 change in patient position rather than repositioning of the device.
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 and pleural surfaces are normal.  Incidental note made of healed right middle
 rib fractures and a solitary bulla in the left mid lung.
