  Low ET tube closely approaching right mainstem bronchus.  Possible new right
  mid lung nodule; suggest to repeat when lines and leads removed to reassess. 
  Streaky opacity at left lung base.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from prior CT from ___ and earlier chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates at the
 orifice of the right mainstem bronchus within 5 mm of it.  An orogastric tube
 courses into the stomach, its distal course not delineated.  The right
 hemidiaphragm shows mild-to-moderate relative elevation that is probably a
 reflection of hepatic enlargement and similar to the prior examination. 
 Patchy left basilar opacities are streaky and nonspecific, although most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is a new nodular focus projecting over the
 right mid lung, suggesting formation of a new nodule over the short interval. 
 However, a confounding factor is overlying tubing and lead, so it may be
 appropriate to repeat the radiograph after removal of overlying leads and
 tubing to see whether the opacity were to persist.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube closely approaching the orifice of the mainstem bronchus
 on the right.  Retraction of the tube by 2-3 cm is recommended.
 
 2.  New nodular focus projecting over the right lung.  Repeat radiographs are
 suggested in order to see whether it may persist following removal of lines
 and tubing.
 
 3.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity, probably due to atelectasis, but other
 etiologies including aspiration or pneumonia are not excluded by this
 examination.
