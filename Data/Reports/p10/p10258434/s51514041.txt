                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes crowd the
 pulmonary vasculature and exaggerate the heart size.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   The mediastinal and hilar contours
 otherwise are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes crowd the pulmonary vasculature and exaggerate
 the heart size.  Recommend repeat films with better inspiration for better
 assessment.
