 Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region is likely atelectasis. 
 There is no dense consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal silhouette is normal.  The cardiac
 size is at the upper limits of normal, and unchanged from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe patchy opacity concerning for pneumonia.
