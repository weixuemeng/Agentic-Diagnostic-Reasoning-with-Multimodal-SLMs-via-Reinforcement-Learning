                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with previous question of pneumonia, now
 with continued fever despite antibiotics.  No lung findings on exam, question
 change from prior chest film.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 12:52.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 13:31 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint opacity in the left mid lung is again identified and felt to correspond
 to a subtle finding abutting the major fissure on the lateral view and
 therefore likely represents a pneumonia in the superior segment of the left
 lower lobe.  The other described left basilar opacity is no longer apparent. 
 There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could reflect a
 tiny effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
