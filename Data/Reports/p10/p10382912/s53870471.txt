                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, question CHF or cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Right lung is
 clear.  There is subtle opacity in the left mid and lower lung, corresponding
 to overlapping osseous structures.  Please note, the opacity ___ in part
 likely reflecting overlapping osseous structures appears new from the prior
 exam and the possibility of subtle pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Recommend
 oblique views to clarify.  No large effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Degenerative osteophytes along the
 anterior mid T-spine noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung may represent
 overlapping osseous structures, although possibility of pneumonia impossible
 to exclude.  Recommend oblique views to clarify.
