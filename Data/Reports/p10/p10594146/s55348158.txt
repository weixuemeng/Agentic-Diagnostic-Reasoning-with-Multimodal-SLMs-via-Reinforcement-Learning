                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alcoholic hepatitis and GPCs in blood //
 Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs 5 ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low but improved since the next most recent study. Heart size
 is exaggerated by low lung volumes but likely top-normal. The lungs appear
 clear. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Enteric tube courses into the stomach and beyond the
 field of view on the frontal projection. The tube is seen on the lateral
 radiograph well into the stomach and then proceeds posteriorly.  It is unclear
 if the tip is in a dilated stomach or into the ligament or Treitz and small
 bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes but no evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Unclear if the tip of the enteric tube is in a dilated stomach or in the
 small bowel.
