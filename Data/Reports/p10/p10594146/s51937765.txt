 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 new interstitial edema.  Lung volumes are low, possibly on the basis of
 ascites.  Small amount of pleural fluid is present predominantly in the
 fissures.  Linear scar or atelectasis in right middle lobe is unchanged. 
 Feeding tube remains in place, coursing below the diaphragm.  Diffuse haziness
 of upper abdomen is consistent with known ascites.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Small pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Low lung volumes, possibly on the basis of ascites.
