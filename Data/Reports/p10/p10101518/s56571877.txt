                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are patchy opacities in
 the left lower lobe suggestive of pneumonia in the appropriate setting,
 including a nodular component of opacification.  A nipple shadow projects over
 the left lower hemithorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia, but including a
 nodular component.  Followup radiographs are suggested to show resolution
 within eight weeks.
