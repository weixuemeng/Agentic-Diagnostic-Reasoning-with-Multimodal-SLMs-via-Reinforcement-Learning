                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chills and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic.  The cardiac silhouette size
 is difficult to assess given the presence of the elevated left hemidiaphragm
 but appears relatively unchanged compared to the scout view from the previous
 CT.  The aorta is unfolded.  The hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are re-
 demonstrated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Subsegmental atelectasis is noted in the left lung base.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Calcified pleural plaques compatible with a history of prior asbestos
 exposure.  Chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm with adjacent subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
