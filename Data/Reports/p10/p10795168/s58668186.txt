                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with epigastric and chest pain post hernia surgery
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 without evidence for pneumomediastinum.  There is continued bulging of the
 right lower mediastinal contour, possibly reflective of residual right
 paraesophageal fluid. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities within
 the right lung base are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is seen. Clips are re- demonstrated at the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence for pneumomediastinum or
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
