                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent nissen modification, paraesophageal
 hernia repair end of ___ now with 3 days nausea, vomiting, melena this
 morning, abdominal and chest pain, fever, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 remain relatively unchanged with persistent bulging of the right mediastinal
 contour possibly reflective of a continued right paraesophageal collection
 which was better appreciated on the recent CT scan. Hilar contours are normal
 and there is no pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities within the lower lobes
 bilaterally likely reflect areas of atelectasis which appear improved compared
 to the prior study. There has also been near complete resolution of the
 previously noted bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified.
 No subdiaphragmatic free air is demonstrated. Clips at the gastroesophageal
 junction indicate prior Nissen fundoplication.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Improved aeration of the lung bases with residual bibasilar atelectasis and
 near complete resolution of the previously noted bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Persistent right mediastinal contour bulge which likely reflects the right
 paraesophageal collection, better assessed on previous CT.
 3. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
