                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung
 volumes are markedly low, which limits the evaluation.  Allowing for this, no
 gross consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size cannot
 be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam due to low lung volumes.  No overt
 pathology.
