                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The lung volumes are low with a small
 pleural effusion on the right and perhaps a tiny effusion on the left.  Aside
 from patchy opacification associated with pleural effusions and low lung
 volumes, probably due to atelectasis, the lungs appear clear.  Exaggerated
 kyphosis and compression deformities along the mid thoracic spine appear not
 significantly changed.  The bones are demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small pleural effusions, but no definite evidence for overt
 congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Borderline cardiomegaly.
