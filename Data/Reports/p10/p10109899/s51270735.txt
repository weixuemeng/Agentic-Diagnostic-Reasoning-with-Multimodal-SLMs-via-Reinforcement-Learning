                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with SOB, cough, + sputum  // evaluate for pneumonia,
 pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated and there is an accentuated thoracic kyphosis.  Soft tissue
 of the neck obscures visualization of the right lung apex.  Within this
 limitation, the lungs are grossly clear.  Blunting of the left lateral
 costophrenic angle is likely due to scarring and prominent pericardial fat. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Old healed left lateral rib fractures
 are noted.  Compression deformities in the thoracic spine are also noted and
 were seen on prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam as detailed above without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
