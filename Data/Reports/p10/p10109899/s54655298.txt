                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and left arm pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours relatively unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is
 noted.  Small right pleural effusion appears new compared to the prior exam. 
 There is also a small amount of fluid within the right minor fissure.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Thoracic kyphosis is re- demonstrated
 with several compression deformities of the mid and lower thoracic spine
 appearing relatively unchanged.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right pleural effusion with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities possibly
 reflecting atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
