                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pacemaker placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker has been placed with its leads terminating in the
 expected location of right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  The lungs are essentially clear.  Lobulation of
 right hemidiaphragm is noted.
