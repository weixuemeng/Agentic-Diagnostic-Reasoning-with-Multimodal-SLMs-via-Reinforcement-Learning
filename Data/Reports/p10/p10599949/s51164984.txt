                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with frequent falls.  History of c-spine fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and the patient's chin
 projecting over and obscuring the lung apices.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly persists.  Mediastinal contours appear grossly unchanged with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again demonstrated.  Hilar contours are
 normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No gross focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures with multiple compression
 deformities re- demonstrated, but poorly assessed.  Remote left-sided rib
 fractures are also again identified, though no acutely displaced fractures
 clearly seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. No gross acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Poor re-
 demonstration of multiple thoracic vertebral compression deformities. Remote
 left-sided rib fractures. No acutely displaced rib fractures identified.
