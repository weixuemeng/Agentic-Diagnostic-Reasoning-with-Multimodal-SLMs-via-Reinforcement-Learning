                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC/right atrial junction. 
 Diffuse reticular and nodular opacities are again noted with worsening
 alveolar opacities, and interval increase in size of small to moderate right
 and small left pleural effusions.  Increased fluid is seen loculated along the
 right lateral hemithorax.  Previously noted right apical pneumothorax is no
 longer seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate but
 appear relatively unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening diffuse parenchymal opacities likely reflecting widespread
 metastatic disease with superimposed worsening pulmonary edema.  Increased
 bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and small on the
 left.
