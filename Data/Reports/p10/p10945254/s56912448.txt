                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  PICC line readjustment.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Widespread predominantly reticular parenchymal
 opacities are unchanged since the prior study.  No interval progression or
 substantial resolution of those findings seen.  More nodular components are
 better appreciated on the recent chest CT, all consistent with known
 metastatic spread, potentially with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Right
 pleural effusion is noted, grossly unchanged.
