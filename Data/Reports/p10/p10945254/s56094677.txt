                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right pneumothorax.  Followup for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement
 in previously seen right apical pneumothorax.  There has also been slight
 interval increase in the size of right pleural effusion.  A pigtail catheter
 is seen in the right hemithorax in a similar position compared with prior
 radiograph.  Left subclavian line is unchanged in position since the prior
 study.  The previously described diffuse reticulonodular opacities consistent
 with metastatic disease are unchanged since the prior studies.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in the right apical pneumothorax and
 interval increase in the size of right pleural effusion.  Otherwise, unchanged
 since the prior study.
