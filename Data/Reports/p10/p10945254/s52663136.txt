                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic salivary cancer presenting with
 severe allergic reaction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are diffuse bilateral nodular
 opacities throughout the lungs compatible with patient's known metastatic
 disease.  No definite new region of consolidation identified.  Right-sided
 pleural effusion appears slightly larger.  There is also suggestion of a trace
 left pleural effusion as well which may be new.  There is also increased
 pleural based opacity involving the right hemithorax more superiorly which
 could represent loculated fluid or pleural-based metastatic disease which has
 progressed.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.  New right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip
 at the RA/SVC junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval enlargement of the right pleural effusion and new trace left pleural
 effusion.  Diffuse nodular opacities compatible with known metastatic disease.
