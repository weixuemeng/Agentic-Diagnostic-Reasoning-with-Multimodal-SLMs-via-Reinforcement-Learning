                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic adenocystic carcinoma with known metastasis to the lung,
 shortness of breath.  Productive cough, question of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA lateral views of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 There are innumerable nodules randomly distributed in both lungs, increased
 compared to prior study with increased interstitial changes in the lungs
 bilaterally.  Small right-sided pleural effusion is mildly increased.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening diffuse bilateral interstitial and nodular opacities may represent
 worsening metastatic disease however superimposed atypical infection or mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.  Small right-sided pleural
 effusion is slightly increased.
