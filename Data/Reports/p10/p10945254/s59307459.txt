                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter has been placed, with evacuation of
 right pleural effusion, but development of a moderate right pneumothorax, with
 apical visceral pleural line at level of the right fourth posterior rib. 
 Within the lungs, widespread nodular and reticular opacities are similar in
 appearance to the previous study, and in keeping with widespread metastatic
 disease in this patient with underlying history of metastatic salivary
 carcinoma.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are seen to better detail on
 the recent CT and are radiographically stable.  Small left pleural effusion
 has slightly increased since the previous chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New moderate right apical pneumothorax with pigtail pleural catheter in
 place.  Dr. ___ was telephoned with this finding, ___ at 4:45
 p.m. at time of discovery.
 
 2.  Widespread metastatic disease.
