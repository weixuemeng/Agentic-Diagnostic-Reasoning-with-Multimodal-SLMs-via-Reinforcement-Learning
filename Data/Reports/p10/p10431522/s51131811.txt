                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Increased opacification of the left base
 suggests atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.  There are old
 healed left posterior rib fractures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification at the left base suggests atelectasis.
