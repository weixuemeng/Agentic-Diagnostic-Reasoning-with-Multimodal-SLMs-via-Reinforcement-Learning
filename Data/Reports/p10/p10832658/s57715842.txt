                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia and syncope today.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well expanded.  Increased density
 projecting over the right mid lung persists and may be slightly worse, but the
 left mid lung field appears improved.  However, there is dense retrocardiac
 opacity which may reflect atelectasis or an infiltrate.  Additionally,
 increased interstitial markings is concerning for interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent opacity in the right mid lung with new left retrocardiac
 opacity, concerning for an ongoing infectious process.  Lingular opacity is
 improved.
 2.  Mild interstitial edema.
