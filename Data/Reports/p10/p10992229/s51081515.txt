 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, possible aspiration, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:05 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the left chest tube, are in constant position.  There is no
 substantial change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and signs of mild fluid overload.  The
 basal parenchymal opacities are constant in appearance.  Overall, the lung
 volumes appear to have improved, with subsequent improvement of ventilation. 
 No new parenchymal opacities.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
