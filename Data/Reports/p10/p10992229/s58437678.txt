                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post arrest with intubation.  Evaluate tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating 10 cm
 cranial to the carina.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Effacement and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 contour is likely due to pleural effusion or possible retrocardiac
 consolidation.  An upper enteric tube passes distally into the stomach.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Effacement of the left hemidiaphragm could be due to effusion,
 consolidation or a combination of both.  
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminates 10 cm cranial to the carina and should be
 advanced by 5 cm for standard positioning.
