                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is mildly enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular
 redistribution, which is worsened compared to the reference study.  There are
 bilateral Kerley B lines and increased opacity at both bases that could be due
 to volume loss/early infiltrate.  The overall impression is that of worsened
 fluid status.
