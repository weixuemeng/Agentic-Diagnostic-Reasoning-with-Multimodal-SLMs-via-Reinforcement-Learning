                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with L1 vertebral body compression
 fracture and anterior chest pain, not cardiac in nature.  Questionable
 malignancy, bone destruction.  Pathological versus degenerative.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  There is mild cardiac
 enlargement.  The configuration suggests a prominence of the left ventricular
 contour to the left and posteriorly, a finding which in conjunction with the
 moderately widened and generally elongated thoracic aorta suggests the
 possibility of systemic hypertension.  The pulmonary vasculature, however, is
 not congested and there is no evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free
 and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  Skeleton skeletal
 structures are grossly within normal limits.  Because of patient's prominent
 ___, the area of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine cannot be
 identified with any detail.  For the conclusive diagnosis of a fracture in
 this area, dedicated lumbar spine examination is recommended.  Our records
 include multiple previous chest examinations, most of which were taken in
 ___.  On these frontal chest examinations, there is no evidence of any
 compression fracture of any vertebral body.
