                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, on VSD, febrile neutropenia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___. 
 CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear without definitive evidence
 of pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours appear
 normal.  Focal irregularity and increased opacity overlying the eighth
 posterior rib on the right likely represents healing rib fracture.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A double-lumen Port-A-Cath is unchanged
 in position.  The lateral radiograph re-demonstrates compression fracture of
 L1 and lytic lesion of the vertebral body of T9.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no definitive evidence of pneumonia.  There is no
 significant appreciable change compared to next most recent chest radiograph.
