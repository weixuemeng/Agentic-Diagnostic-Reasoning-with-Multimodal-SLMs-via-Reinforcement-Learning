                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  Focal area of increased opacity overlying the eighth
 posterior rib, likely represents a healing pathologic rib fracture in this
 patient with myeloma.  Additional more subtle rib lesions are seen throughout
 and have been documented to greater detail on prior CT.  There are no pleural
 effusions.
 
 High-grade compression deformity at the L1 level is similar to recent lumbar
 spine radiograph of this region on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Focal opacity overlying periphery of right mid lung is likely related to a
 healing pathologic rib fracture, but additional shallow oblique radiographs
 may be considered to exclude a focal pneumonia simulating a rib lesion, if
 warranted clinically.
 
 2.  Extensive myelomatous involvement of imaged skeletal structures, including
 a high-grade compression deformity at L1.
