                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and positive PPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Fullness of the
 right paratracheal stripe is noted.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fullness of the right paratracheal stripe could reflect underlying venous
 distention, however all lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated including no findings to
 suggest active tuberculosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 CT of the chest can be obtained for further assessment of the fullness of the
 right paratracheal stripe.
