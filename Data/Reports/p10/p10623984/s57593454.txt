 No large pleural effusion is seen.  Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are
 again seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant interval increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally is worrisome for worsening pulmonary edema, given short-term
 interval.   Superimposed infection not excluded.
