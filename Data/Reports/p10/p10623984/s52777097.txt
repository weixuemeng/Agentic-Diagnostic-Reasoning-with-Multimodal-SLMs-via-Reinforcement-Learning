 INDICATION:  ___M with  hypoxia  // EvAl pma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen throughout. Bibasilar
 opacities may be due to atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits. Old healed left-sided rib and left clavicle fractures
 are again noted as well as incompletely imaged proximal left humerus fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of interstitial edema. Bibasilar opacities potentially
 atelectasis noting aspiration or infection are not entirely excluded.
