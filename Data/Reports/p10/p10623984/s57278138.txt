                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Patchy, linear bibasilar
 opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  An endotracheal tube is noted,
 terminating approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube passes below
 the inferior field of view.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Chronic deformity of the left clavicle suggests prior fracture. 
 Old healed left posterior rib fractures are also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminating approximately 6 cm above the carina.
