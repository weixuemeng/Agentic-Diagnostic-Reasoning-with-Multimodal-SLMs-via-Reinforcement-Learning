                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction
 of the SVC and right atrium.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm
 from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Heart size is
 normal.  Aortic knob is diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Interstitial opacities are seen within the left upper lung
 field, findings which could reflect chronic changes.  Similarly, linear
 opacities within both lung bases may reflect scarring or perhaps subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or large
 pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  Multiple fractures are seen
 involving the ribs bilaterally, left clavicle, and left proximal humerus, all
 which appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of all lines and tubes.
 2. Probable chronic changes within the left upper lobe and scarring and/or
 subsegmental atelectasis involving the lung bases.
