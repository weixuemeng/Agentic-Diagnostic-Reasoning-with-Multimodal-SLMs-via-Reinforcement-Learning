                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of decreased
 saturations and increased edema in the lower extremities.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker tip terminates at the level of the expected location
 of the right ventricle.  There is diffuse cardiac enlargement involving all
 the chambers.  There is also hyperinflation demonstrated on both PA and
 lateral views.  Scarring in the right mid lung is unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is evidence of pleural
 thickening at the right lung base.
 
 Assessment of the radiograph along the right heart border demonstrates
 increased density that might potentially represent additional atelectasis but
 interval development of abnormality in this location cannot be excluded. 
 Assessment of the patient with chest CT to exclude the possibility of interval
 development of right middle lobe process is required.
 
 Findings were submitted to radiology Dashboard for communication of critical
 results by Dr ___ on ___ at 4:46 pm
