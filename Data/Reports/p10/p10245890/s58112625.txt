                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___. CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Massive cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Single pacemaker lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The aortic
 arch is again calcified. Opacities at the lung base on the lateral radiograph
 have worsened. A small pleural effusion is seen in the posterior costophrenic
 sulcus, however the laterality is unclear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stable massive cardiomegaly.
 2. Worsening opacities at the lung base on the lateral radiograph may reflect
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
