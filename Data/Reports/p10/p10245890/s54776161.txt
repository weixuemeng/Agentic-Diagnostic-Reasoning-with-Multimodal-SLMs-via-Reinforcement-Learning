 There is a single-lead left-sided pacemaker with distal lead tip in the right
 ventricle.  There is markedly enlarged cardiomegaly.  This is stable.  The
 visualized lung fields are grossly clear; however, they are somewhat
 hyperexpanded, suggestive of emphysema.  There are degenerative changes and
 mild wedge compression deformities of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
