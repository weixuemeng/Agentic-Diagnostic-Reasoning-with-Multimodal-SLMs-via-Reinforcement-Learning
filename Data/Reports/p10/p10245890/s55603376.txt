                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP, upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again markedly enlarged with a single-lead pacemaker
 device, whose lead again terminates over the expected region of the right
 ventricle.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable
 including moderate tortuosity and calcification along the thoracic aorta.  A
 small pleural effusion is probably new on the right with patchy right basilar
 opacity, probably due to atelectasis.  The kyphotic curvature is mildly
 exaggerated with minimal loss in height among several lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies, but not likely to be acute.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected new small pleural effusion on the right with patchy
 minor atelectasis, although no definite parenchymal edema.  Similar marked
 cardiomegaly.
