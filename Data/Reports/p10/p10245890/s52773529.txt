                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath, question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and a
 single-lead pacemaker.  There is a new dense consolidation in the right mid
 lung, could be due to overlapping shadows or a new area of volume
 loss/infiltrate.  There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution, but no
 overt pulmonary edema.
