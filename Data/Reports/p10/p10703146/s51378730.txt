                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough and leukocytosis.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
