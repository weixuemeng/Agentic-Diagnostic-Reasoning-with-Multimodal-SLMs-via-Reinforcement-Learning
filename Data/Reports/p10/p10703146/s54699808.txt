                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Left retrocardiac opacity is minimal
 and might represent atelectasis.  The left PICC line tip is seen at the level
 of mid SVC.  The rest of the lungs are essentially clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Concern for left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.
