                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent lower extremity surgery, presenting with altered mental
 status from rehab.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained with two
 exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is no consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes
 and bronchovascular structures are likely accentuated by the low lung volumes,
 though within normal limits, and not significantly changed.  A right PICC is
 in unchanged position with tip in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes; no evidence of pneumonia.
