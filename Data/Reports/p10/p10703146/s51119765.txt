                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New altered mental status.  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
