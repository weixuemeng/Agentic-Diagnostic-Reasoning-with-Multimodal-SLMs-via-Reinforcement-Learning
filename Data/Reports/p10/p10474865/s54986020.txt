                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old female with shortness of breath.  Question pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Again seen is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to an
 effusion.  More dense left basilar opacity is likely in part due to known
 large hiatal hernia and effusion.  Bibasilar opacities may also be from
 superimposed atelectasis noting infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
