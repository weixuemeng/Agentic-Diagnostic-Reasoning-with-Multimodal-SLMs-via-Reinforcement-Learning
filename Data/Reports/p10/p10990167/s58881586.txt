                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation in a patient with osteomyelitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs
 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  Probable mild cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.  .  No focal consolidation or effusion is identified.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Tiny densities seen in the right lower zone are
 unchanged compared with ___ MR and the ___ CT scan and are
 compatible with small calcified granulomas.
 
 Density projecting anterior to the spine adjacent to the diaphragm on lateral
 views compatible with a known small hiatal hernia.
 
 
 Incidental note is made of an old healed left posterior fifth rib fracture. 
 Probable diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable background COPD.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 3. No focal consolidation or fusion.
 4. Probable small hiatal hernia.
 5. Calcified granulomas again noted, unchanged, consistent with prior
 granulomatous disease.
 6. Probable osteopenia.
