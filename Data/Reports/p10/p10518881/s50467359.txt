                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 03:11.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube terminating in
 the very proximal stomach with weighted portion at the proximal
 stomach/gastroesophageal junction.  There are low lung volumes and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Previously questioned opacity at the left costophrenic angle is
 less apparent on the current study and may have related to overlying soft
 tissue.
