 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right rib fixations are in
 unchanged position.  On the left, a pre-existing pleural effusion and
 elevation of the hemidiaphragm has decreased in severity.  However, the left
 hemidiaphragm is still elevated and areas of atelectasis and, potentially, a
 small left pleural effusion are still present.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is
 unchanged.
