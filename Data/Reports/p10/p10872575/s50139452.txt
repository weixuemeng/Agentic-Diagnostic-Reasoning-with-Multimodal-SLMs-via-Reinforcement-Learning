                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and decreased breath sounds on the right on physical
 exam, here to evaluate for pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is complete opacification of the right lung base, compatible
 with a moderate-sized right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation.  The presence of Kerley B lines suggest mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  The left lung base is well aerated.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to
 opacification at the right lung base.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  There is partial opacification of the aortic knob.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation.  Recommend clinical correlation to exclude underlying
 pneumonia.
 2.  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
