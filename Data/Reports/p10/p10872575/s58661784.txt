 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung ca with sob  // r/o effusion ore pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Again, there coarse reticular opacities involving in the majority of the right
 lung which appears slightly increased as compared to the prior study,
 worrisome for lymphangitic spread of malignancy. There is increased right base
 opacity which could be due to worsening of malignant process, superimposed
 infection not entirely excluded. There is persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle due to small pleural effusion which may be slightly
 increased. There is now subtle increase in interstitial markings in the left
 mid to lower lung, could be due to mild interstitial edema versus disease spur
 at. No left pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
