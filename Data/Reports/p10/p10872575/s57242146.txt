                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CP, SOB  // eval for PNA, cHF, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs the most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Again seen are coarse
 reticular opacities involving the majority of the right lung, which appear
 increased from the prior examination and are concerning for worsening
 lymphangitic spread of malignancy. An opacity at the base of the right lung
 also appears increased from the prior study which may worsening consolidation,
 mass or atelectasis. Also seen is a subtle increase in the reticular opacities
 throughout the mid and lower zones of the left lung.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. The right-sided effusion has slightly increased since prior. 
 There is no left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Coarse reticular opacities involving the majority of the right lung and the
 lower portion of the left lung appears slightly increased from the prior study
 and are concerning for worsening lymphangitic spread of malignancy, edema also
 possible.
 
 Additionally, the right basal opacity is increased from the prior study which
 may represent combination of infectious consolidation, enlarging mass or
 atelectasis.
 
 Right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size.
