 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:54 PM
  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema is not significantly changed compared to
  the study from earlier today.  Widening of the vascular pedicle is similar to
  the prior study from earlier today, but has markedly increased compared to the
  radiograph from ___, possibly loculated pleural fluid or partial
  right upper lobe collapse, less likely dilated mediastinal veins or a
  hematoma.  In this patient has ongoing desaturations, further evaluation with
  a chest CT may provide additional information.  No pneumothorax, with a right
  pleural catheter in place.  Findings and recommendations were discussed with
  Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 17:53 via telephone on the day of the study, ___ min
  after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___-year-old woman status post talc pleurodesis with
 desaturation.  Assess interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 8:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable single view chest x-ray in supine position shows stable
 diffuse opacification of the right lung due to recent pleurodesis with  two
 right pleural drains ending in the upper third and at the right lung base,but
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  Right paramediastinal opacity has been
 better characterized in chest CT of ___ at 11:44 p.m. as an area
 of loculated pleural effusion and pleural thickening.  Small left lung base
 pleural effusion and atelectasis is stable.  Heart size is moderately
 enlarged, with interval increase of vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung opacification is due to loculated pleural effusion
 alongside right costovertebral place with bibasilar pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly with interval increase of vascular
 congestion.
