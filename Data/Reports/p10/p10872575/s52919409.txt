                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 right chest tube without definite pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas is seen
 extending upward and downward from the area of insertion of the chest tube.
 
 There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
 congestion, similar to the previous study.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle
 on the right is consistent with pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis
 at the right base.  The right heart border is not well seen, raising the
 possibility of superimposed middle lobe pneumonia.  If the condition of the
 patient would permit, lateral view would be most helpful.
