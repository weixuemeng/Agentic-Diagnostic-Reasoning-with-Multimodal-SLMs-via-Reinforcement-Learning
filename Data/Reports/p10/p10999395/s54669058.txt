                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PE, hypoxic respiratory failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Subtle increased right upper lobe opacity.  Mild vascular
 congestion has improved.  Small retrocardiac opacity is stable.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in size, decreased since
 prior examination and likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.  Mediastinal
 contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Interval removal of endotracheal tube and enteric feeding tube.  Right IJ CVL
 tip is in the low SVC with left IJ CVL tip in the SVC junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle increased right upper lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or
 early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Persistently hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar and retrocardiac opacity.
 3.  Top-normal heart size, decreased since prior examination.
 4.  Improved mild vascular congestion.
 5.  Right IJ CVL tip in low SVC, left IJ CVL tip in SVC junction.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 12:07 PM, 5 minutes after
