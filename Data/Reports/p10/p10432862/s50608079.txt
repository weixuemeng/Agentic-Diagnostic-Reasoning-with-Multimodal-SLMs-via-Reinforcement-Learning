                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with loculated hydropneumothorax and worsening
 tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ at 11:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large left hydropneumothorax is re- demonstrated with near complete whiteout
 of the left hemithorax and air-fluid level projecting over the left posterior
 upper hemithorax. There is no significant rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large
 left hydropneumothorax. Left basilar opacification reflecting a combination of
 compressive atelectasis with likely infection is again noted. Right lung
 demonstrates a calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe. No focal
 consolidation is seen in the right lung. Previously noted ground-glass nodular
 opacities in the right middle and lower lobes are not well visualized on the
 current exam. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left hydropneumothorax with left basilar opacification concerning for
 infection as seen on the prior CT. Ground-glass nodular opacities in the right
 lung base seen on prior CT are not well assessed on the current exam.
