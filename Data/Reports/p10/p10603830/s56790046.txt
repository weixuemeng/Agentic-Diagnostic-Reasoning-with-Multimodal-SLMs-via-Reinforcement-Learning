                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral contusion, here to
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is accentuated due to
 underinflation of the lungs, but likely top normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable on this supine view.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process, specifically no pneumothorax.
