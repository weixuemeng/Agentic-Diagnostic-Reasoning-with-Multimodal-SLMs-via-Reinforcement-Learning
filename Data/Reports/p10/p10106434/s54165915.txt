                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is a large right pleural effusion with
 the opacification extending upward to the level of the hilum.  No vascular
 congestion or evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  In the absence of shift of
 the mediastinum, this implies substantial volume loss in the right lower lung.
