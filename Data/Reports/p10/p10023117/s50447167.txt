 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Left-sided pacemaker has three leads, one in right
 atrium, one in right ventricle and the last one in the coronary sinus. Left
 jugular line is at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and superior vena
 cava.  Right-sided PICC line is still looped in the distal subclavian vein and
 ends in the upper SVC.  Bibasilar consolidation which is probably atelectasis
 is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The stomach is more dilated
 than previous exam.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pneumothorax.
 2.  Right-sided PICC line is still looped inside the subclavian vein.
 3.  Unchanged bibasilar consolidation.
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
