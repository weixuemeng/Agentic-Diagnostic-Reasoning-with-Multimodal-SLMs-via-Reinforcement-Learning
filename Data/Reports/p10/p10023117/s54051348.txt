                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Triple-lead
 left-sided AICD is similar in position.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Right infrahilar opacity may relate to atelectasis and overlap of vascular
 structures but consolidation is not entirely excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting; however, the appearance is likely similar to scout
 radiograph and chest CT from ___.  No pneumothorax.
