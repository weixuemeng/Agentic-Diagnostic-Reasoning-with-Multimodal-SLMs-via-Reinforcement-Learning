  1. Mild apparent thickening of the right paratracheal stripe could represent a
  prominent SVC, though mediastinal lymphadenopathy cannot be definitively
  excluded on the basis of this examination. If there is persistent clinical
  concern, a chest CT could be performed for further evaluation.
  2. Mild cardiomegaly, in the absence of central vascular congestion and
  pulmonary edema, could represent cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
  Recommend correlation with physical exam findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with retrosternal chest pain and back pain, mild
 cough  // Eval for acute process, PNA, mediastinal widening
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal. No focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.   Mild
 apparent thickening of the right paratracheal stripe could represent a
 prominent SVC and partly be explained by an unfolded thoracic aorta, though
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy cannot be definitively excluded.  Heart is
 borderline in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild apparent thickening of the right paratracheal stripe could represent a
 prominent SVC/vasculature, though mediastinal lymphadenopathy cannot be
 definitively excluded on the basis of this examination.  If there is
 persistent clinical concern, a chest CT could be performed for further
 evaluation.
 2. Borderline heart size.
