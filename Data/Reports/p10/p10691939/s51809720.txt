                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New right internal jugular line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: A left internal jugular catheter terminates within the left axillary
 vein.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The lung volumes are low, which accentuates the bronchovascular structures.
 Despite this, there is evidence of mild pulmonary edema and congestion of the
 central vasculature.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is very tortuous, and the ascending portion may be
 dilated.  The hilar pulmonary arteries are dilated Calcifications are seen
 within the carotid arteries.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned left internal jugular catheter.  No pneumothorax.  
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.  
 3.  Pulmonary hypertension.
 4.  Possible dilatation, ascending thoracic aorta.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 1:23 on ___ at the time of discovery by telephone.
