                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, hx of recent pna  // eval for infiltrate,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 06:06.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  There relatively dense left basilar opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  This is likely in part due to an effusion
 although superimposed consolidation is also suspected.  Surgical chain sutures
 project over the right mid lung.  The right lung is otherwise grossly clear
 within limitation of low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense left basilar opacity, potentially due to component of effusion although 
 superimposed consolidation is likely.  Followup after treatment is suggested
 to document resolution.
