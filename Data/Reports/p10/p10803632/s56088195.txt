 location of the gastric lumen with tip directed cephalad in the fundus.  Lungs
 are clear bilaterally without a focal consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
