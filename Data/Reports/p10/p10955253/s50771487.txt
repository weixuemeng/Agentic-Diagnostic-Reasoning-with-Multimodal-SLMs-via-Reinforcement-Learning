                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflation and
 flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of emphysema.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aside from aortic
 tortuosity, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Subtle radiodensity
 above the level of manubrium may represent junctional line as seen on
 CTA-Chest.  Prior vertebroplasty is noted in the lower thoracic vertebra.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please correlate with results
 of CTA-Chest from ___.
