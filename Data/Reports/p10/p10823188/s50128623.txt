                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes seen on the
 current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Linear
 right basilar opacity is most likely due to atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle may also be due to atelectasis although underlying
 effusion is also possible.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits for technique.  Degenerative changes noted at the right shoulder as on
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable right basilar atelectasis noting effusion is also possible. 
 Otherwise unremarkable exam based on low lung volumes and supine technique.
