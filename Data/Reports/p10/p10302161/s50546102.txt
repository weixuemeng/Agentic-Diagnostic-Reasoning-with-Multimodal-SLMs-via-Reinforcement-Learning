                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.  Also CT abdomen from ___ was reviewed (lung bases).
 
 Current study demonstrates normal heart size and mediastinal widths but
 tortuous aorta.  Extensive interstitial prominence is noted bilaterally
 consistent with at least moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  More
 confluent opacities in the right lower lung still most likely reflects edema,
 although infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Followup on the
 patient after diuresis is suggested.
