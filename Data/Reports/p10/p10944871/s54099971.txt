                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic stenosis and stents presenting with fluid overload versus
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild
 cardiomegaly.  There are small new pleural effusions bilaterally since the
 prior radiographs.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases are probably due to
 associated atelectasis but there is no definite parenchymal edema.  Fissures
 appear slightly more thickened, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pleural effusions and thickened fissures suggesting mild fluid overload
 although no frank pulmonary edema.
