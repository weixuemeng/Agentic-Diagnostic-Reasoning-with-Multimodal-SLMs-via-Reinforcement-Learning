                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  High end expiratory pressure on ventilator since advancement of
 endotracheal tube.  Patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval advancement of an endotracheal tube, which
 now terminates only about 1 cm above the orifice of the right mainstem
 bronchus.  A ___ tube again is seen passing through the esophagus,
 although its endpoint is not imaged.  Costophrenic sulci are also partly
 excluded, but there has been no definite change.  Bilateral pleural effusions,
 greater on the right than left, are probably unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique, and persistent interstitial changes suggest
 pulmonary congestion, although the latter appear improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low-lying endotracheal tube.  Retracting the tube slightly may be
 helpful if clinically indicated.  Improving pulmonary edema and probably
 unchanged pleural effusions, although not fully imaged, including a large one
 on the right side.
