 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:13 PM
  Interval decrease in right pleural effusion, now small in size, with adjacent
  atelectasis. No pneumothorax. The rightward-shifted appearance of the trachea
  is likely due to rotation but continued followup is recommended. Little change
  otherwise from prior study from the same day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion, status post thoracocentesis, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:20 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  There is no evidence of post-procedural pneumothorax. 
 The extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased, but
 there is a clearly visible remnant right pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Minimal fluid overload.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung
 bases.
