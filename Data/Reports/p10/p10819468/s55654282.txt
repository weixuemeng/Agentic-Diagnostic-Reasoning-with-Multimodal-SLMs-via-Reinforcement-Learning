                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the degree of pulmonary vascular
 congestion has somewhat decreased, though part of this may be due to the
 upright position.  Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists
 with large right pleural effusion with atelectasis involving the right middle
 and lower lobes.
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is seen but the left chest is
 otherwise clear.
