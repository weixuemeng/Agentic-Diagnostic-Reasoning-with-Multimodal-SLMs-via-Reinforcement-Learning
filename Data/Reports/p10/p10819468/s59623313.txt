 AP CHEST, ___, 5:42 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a pleural effusion, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right pleural effusion is substantially smaller.  Inferior displacement of the
 right major fissure reflects right lower lobe atelectasis.  Pulmonary and
 mediastinal vascular congestion have improved, but moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette has not, since it was much smaller on ___. 
 This raises the possibility of the interval development of moderate
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
