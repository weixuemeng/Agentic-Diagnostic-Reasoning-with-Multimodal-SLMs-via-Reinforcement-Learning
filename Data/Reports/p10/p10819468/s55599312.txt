                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 849 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with GI bleed, off hemodialysis for one
 month, volume overload, question free air.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 849 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent right layering pleural effusion and smaller left effusion. 
 Patchy right basilar opacity essentially stable.  Interval improvement in
 aeration at the left base.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart remains
 enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Prominence of the right paratracheal soft
 tissues is most likely related to vascular structures which are exaggerated
 due to the patient's marked rotation on the current examination.  No
 pneumothorax.
