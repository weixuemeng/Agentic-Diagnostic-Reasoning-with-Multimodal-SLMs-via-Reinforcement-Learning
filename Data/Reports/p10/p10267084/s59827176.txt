 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right VATS wedge resection for pulmonary nodule,
 followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 right-sided VATS thoracotomy.  An according chest tube is in place and a small
 post-procedural apical pneumothorax of approximately 1 cm in width is seen. 
 In addition, the right lung apex and the right lung bases show post-procedural
 opacities, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and local bleeding. 
 No pleural effusions.  Low lung volumes.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No abnormalities in the left lung.
