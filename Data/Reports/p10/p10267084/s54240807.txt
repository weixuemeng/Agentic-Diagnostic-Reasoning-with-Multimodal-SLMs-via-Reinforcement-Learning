                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation and fever, status post right upper lobe wedge
 resection.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and/or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous right upper lobe opacities are increased, first
 appearing on the postoperative radiograph from ___, likely a
 combination of postoperative hematoma/atelectasis and developing infection. 
 Additionally, there are increased right lower lung heterogeneous opacities,
 likely atelectasis.  Mild-to-moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis is not
 significantly changed.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings concerning for developing right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Increased right lower lung atelectasis.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild-to-moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis and small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:34
 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study, directly after discovery of the
 finding.
