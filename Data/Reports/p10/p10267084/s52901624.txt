                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right upper lobe wedge biopsy,
 presents for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___, ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: There has been interval resolution of the right upper lobe
 consolidation seen on the prior study, suggestive of resorption of
 post-surgical hemorrhage. There also has been interval resolution of the left
 small pleural effusion and stable small right pleural effusion compared to the
 study from ___. There is a new right lower lobe loculation of
 pleural fluid. There is no pneumothorax. The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal. The heart size is normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. New right lower lobe pleural fluid loculation.
 
 2. Stable small right pleural effusion and resolution of left pleural
 effusion.
 
 3. Overall improvement of the right upper lobe consolidation, likely from
 resorption of previous post-surgical hemorrhage.
