                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of interval change in a patient status post right
 upper lobe VATS wedge resection and a history of cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed.  Compared
 to the prior chest radiograph of ___, there is interval improvement in
 the right upper lobe opacity which could represent a combination of
 hemorrhage, atelectasis, and infection.  Improvement in bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions is also noted.  The
 right-sided internal jugular line has been removed.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in right upper lobe opacity, bilateral lower
 lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
