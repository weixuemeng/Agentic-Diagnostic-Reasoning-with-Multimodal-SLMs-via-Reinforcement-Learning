                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax in a patient status post VATS right
 upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are reviewed and compared to the
 most recent prior study.  Opacity in the right upper lung has decreased and
 likely represents postoperative bleeding or atelectasis which is expected. 
 The right-sided chest tube has been removed and a small 1-cm right apical
 pneumothorax is unchanged.  The lung volumes have improved and bibasilar
 atelectasis has decreased.  The heart size and hilar contours are normal and
 there are aortic calcifications.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax status post removal or right
 chest tube.  
 2.  Improved lung volumes and decreased bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Improved right upper lung opacity, likely represents expected
 postoperative bleeding and atelectasis.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were communicated to ___ by Dr. ___
 at 12:37, one hour after the time of discovery.
