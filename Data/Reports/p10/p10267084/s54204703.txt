                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post resection of a pulmonary nodule.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube ends 3.3 cm above the level of the carina.  An
 enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and likely out of
 the field-of-view inferiorly.  A new right internal jugular central venous
 catheter ends in the uppermost portion of the SVC.  Heterogeneous right upper
 lobe opacities are some combination of postoperative hemorrhage, atelectasis,
 and infection.  Heterogeneous left perihilar opacities correlate to
 ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe seen on the accompanying CT from
 ___, possibly additional areas of infection.  Right greater than
 left small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the
 accompanying CT.  There is moderate left and minimal right basilar compressive
 atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change in right upper lobe heterogeneous
 opacities, representing some combination of postoperative hemorrhage,
 atelectasis, and developing infection, fully evaluated on the CT from ___.  Please see the CT report for additional details.
 
 2.  Heterogeneous left perihilar opacities, corresponding to scattered
 ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe on subsequent CT, concerning for
 additional infectious foci.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, better seen on
 CT.
 
 4.  Moderate left and mild right lower lung atelectasis.
