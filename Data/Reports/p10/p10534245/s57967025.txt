                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and IABP  // Interval changes     
 Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 08:57.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is 2 cm from the apex of the aortic knob,
 variation probably due to changes in patient position.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly stable.  Loculated right pleural abnormality largely in
 the upper hemi thorax is also unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is more
 engorged today than yesterday, but I do not see pulmonary edema.  Extent of
 left lower lobe atelectasis is obscured by the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumothorax.
