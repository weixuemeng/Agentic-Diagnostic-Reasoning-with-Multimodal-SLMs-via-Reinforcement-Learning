 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderately severe bibasilar consolidation is improving on the right crit
 particularly, less dramatically on the left.  Since there is no pulmonary
 edema in the upper lobes this is more likely to be combination of pneumonia
 and aspiration than chest dependent edema, even of the heart is huge and the
 pulmonary vasculature is engorged.  Small right pleural effusion unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax.
