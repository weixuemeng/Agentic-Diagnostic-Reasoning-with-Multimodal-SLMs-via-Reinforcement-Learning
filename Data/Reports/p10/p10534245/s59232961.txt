 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at ___:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph ___ at ___:___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the right
 pulmonary outflow tract.  Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. 
 Heart remains stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion could also have this appearance.  The right pleural
 abnormalities are more apparent suggesting increasing loculated pleural fluid.
 More focal opacity in the right lower lung not significantly changed and may
 reflect either an infectious process or rounded atelectasis when correlated
 with recent chest CT dated ___.  No pneumothorax.
