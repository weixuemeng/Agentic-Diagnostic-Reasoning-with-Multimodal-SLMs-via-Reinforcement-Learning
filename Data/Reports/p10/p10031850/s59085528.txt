                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 14:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post PICC, question change in
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 13:35.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 14:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient
 rotation on the current study as well as an increasing left basilar airspace
 process.  Given the focality of this finding, this either reflects partial
 lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of layering effusion or
 aspiration/pneumonia.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema in the setting of underlying
 emphysema could also have this appearance.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 Smaller layering right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The patient's
 mandible obscures the lung apices.  Calcification in aorta consistent with
 atherosclerosis.
