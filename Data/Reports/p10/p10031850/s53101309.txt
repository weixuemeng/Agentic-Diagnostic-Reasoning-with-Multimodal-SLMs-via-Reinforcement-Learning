 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line.
 
 Left PICC tip is in the mid-SVC.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the
 projection.  There has been markedly improved, almost completely resolved
 opacities in the left lung.  Minimal opacities remain in the retrocardiac
 region consistent with resolving atelectasis or aspiration.  In the right
 lower lobe, there are persistent minimal opacities.  This could be due to
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small
 right effusion.
