                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Aortic arch calcifications are again noted.  Ill-defined
 bibasilar opacities are likely due to mild atelectasis and/or overlying soft
 tissues.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
