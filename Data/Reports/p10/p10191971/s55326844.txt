                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, fever and neutropenia,
 question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared with ___, the PICC line has been removed.  The upper zone
 redistribution is slightly less pronounced and there is some increase in the
 subsegmental atelectasis at the right base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.  
 
 Again seen is background hyperinflation with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Heart size at the
 upper limits of normal.  Increased density on the inner surface of the right
 and left chest wall appears to represent subpleural fat. 
 
 No CHF or new focal consolidation is identified.
