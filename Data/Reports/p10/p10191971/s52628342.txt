                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right subclavian line.  Evaluate position of line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph and chest CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi supine chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube terminate 4.5 cm above the carina.  A new right
 subclavian venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  An orogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm, the tip is not included on this examination.  As
 compared to prior examination, there has been interval improvement of
 perihilar bronchovascular opacities.  Right lung opacity has also improved. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is rightward shift
 of the cardiac silhouette likely secondary to volume loss at the right lung
 base. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New right-sided subclavian venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 2. Improved multifocal consolidations worse in the right lower lobe likely due
 to pneumonia. Component of vascular congestion has also improved.
