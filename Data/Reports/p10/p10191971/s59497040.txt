 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Fullness of

 more focal opacification in the right lung base appear slightly progressed in
 the interval.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Small right pleural effusion
 is noted.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.

 reflective of lymphomatous infiltration with superimposed bronchitis.  More
 focal opacity in the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.  Small right
