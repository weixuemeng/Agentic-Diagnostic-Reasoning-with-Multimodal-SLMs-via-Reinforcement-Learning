                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and lymphomatous
 infiltration of peribronchial tissue, now with worsening shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___, and CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates very low lung
 volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There are persistent
 bilateral parenchymal peribronchial opacities, which is improving from the
 prior study.  The heart size is normal.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, consistent with known mediastinal and hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary
 edema.  Right subclavian central venous line ends at the mid-SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of bilateral parenchymal opacities.
 No pulmonary edema.
