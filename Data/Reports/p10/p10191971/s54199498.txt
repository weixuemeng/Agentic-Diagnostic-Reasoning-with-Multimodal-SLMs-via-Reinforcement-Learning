                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Widespread parenchymal
 opacities in the perihilar area in the right lower lobe appear to be unchanged
 since the prior study, corresponding to the peribronchovascular extensive
 abnormalities seen on the recent CT chest.  Finding might correspond to the
 lymphomatous infiltration.  Bronchitis might be additional possibility, but
 coexisting of the two entities is most likely.  There is no definitive
 evidence of interval development of pulmonary edema.
