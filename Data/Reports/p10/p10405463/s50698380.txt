                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bowel perf, mechanically ventilated.  //
 assess for pneumonia, pulmonary edema      assess for pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged. Again there are low lung volumes with
 prominence of cardiac silhouette, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, and
 bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis. In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the diffuse parenchymal changes would make it
 very difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
