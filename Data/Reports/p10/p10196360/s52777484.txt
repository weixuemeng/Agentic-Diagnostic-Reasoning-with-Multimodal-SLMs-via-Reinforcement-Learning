                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for fluid overload or local
 consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  There is mild interstitial edema without lobar consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour appears somewhat
 prominent, likely due to an unfolded thoracic aorta with linear calcification
 along the ascending aorta.  The imaged osseous structures are intact, though
 note is made of an old right mid clavicular shaft deformity
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild edema and cardiomegaly.
