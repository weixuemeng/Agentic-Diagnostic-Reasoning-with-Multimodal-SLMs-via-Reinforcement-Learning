 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate enlarged of the cardiac silhouette is new due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial .  There is no widening of of the mediastinum to suggest elevated
 central venous pressure due to right heart failure or tamponade.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lateral view shows a small retrosternal
 opacity which could be costal cartilage or small lung lesion.  Oblique views
 might be helpful in making the distinction.  Lungs are otherwise clear.
 
 Shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen. Thickening of
 the apical pleural margins is smooth and symmetric due to fat deposition.
