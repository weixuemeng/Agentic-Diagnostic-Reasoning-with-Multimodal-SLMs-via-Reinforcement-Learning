                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with increasing shortness of breath,
 evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Position of previously described left-sided
 permanent pacer connected to two intracavitary electrodes remains unchanged. 
 Heart size has increased mildly.  The thoracic aorta is unchanged and shows
 rather extensive walled calcifications mostly at the level of the arch.  It is
 also moderately elongated but the contours are grossly unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is more prominent than on preceding examination with
 distended venous vasculature in the lungs with perivascular haze.  Similar as
 already seen on previous examination, there exist thin linear densities on the
 bases representing peripheral atelectasis or possibly scar formations.  They
 are rather unchanged and there is no evidence of new discrete pneumonic
 infiltrates.  Also, the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from
 any major fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. 
 Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly unchanged and remain normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increasing heart size and moderately distended pulmonary
 vascular pattern indicative of mild degree of chronic left-sided failure. 
 Comparison shows the patient is more congested than she was on previous
 examination in ___.  Efforts with dehydration therapy will probably correct
 this finding which could be documented on a followup chest examination in a
 week or two of so required.
