                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A strike.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  A
 dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged and there is slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery. 
 Reticular nodular opacities projecting over the left lower lobe are of
 indeterminate age, given lack of prior imaging available for comparison, and
 may be due to chronic changes, although atypical infection is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  There is biapical pleural thickening. 
 Aside from this, the right lung is clear.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
