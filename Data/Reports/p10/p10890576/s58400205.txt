                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT of the abdomen from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  A double-lead
 pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle,
 respectively.  The heart is again enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An
 extensive interstitial abnormality involving the mid-to-lower lung is more
 extensive than before and there is a similar new abnormality, although not as
 extensive, involving the right lower lung, particularly the right middle lobe.
 Elsewhere, lung parenchyma is mostly spared.  Mild degenerative changes appear
 similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening asymmetric interstitial abnormalities involving the
 lung bases, greater on the left than right.  Although an acute on chronic
 process is possible, it seems more likely that there is a background process
 of worsening interstitial lung disease to explain the appearance.
