 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained.  A rounded opacity projects over the
 medial right apex and could reflect the site of pneumonia.  The lungs are

 or pneumothorax.  Mildly accentuated kyphosis of the thoracic spine is
 accentuated by unchanged anterior wedging of mid-to-lower thoracic spine
 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rounded right apical opacity could reflect pneumonia.  Followup
 radiograph in four weeks' time after treatment is recommended to document
 resolution.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 17:05 on
