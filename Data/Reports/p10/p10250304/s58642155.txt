                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and frontal views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature. Within this context, heart size is normal.  Prominent widening of
 the upper mediastinum, significantly incrased compared to prior.  Hilar
 contours are normal. Lungs are clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent interval widening of the upper mediastinum may be secondary to low
 lung volumes and technique.  Recommend repeat PA and lateral study and if this
 finding persists, this must be evaluated with CT.
