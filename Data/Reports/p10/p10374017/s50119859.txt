                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleuritic chest pain and possible pleural
 effusions, pulmonary emboli etc.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is reflected in bronchial cuffing and
 fissural thickening.  There is also a small volume of pleural fluid in each
 hemithorax.  The heart is normal size.  Pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal
 veins are not distended.  I suppose the interstitial abnormality could be
 infectious, but the symmetry and dependent distribution argue for edema, but
 there are no concurrent cardiovascular findings.  Does the patient have low
 serum albumin or perhaps she recently got an intravascular volume load, but it
 is no longer hypervolemic.
 
 After her lungs clear, she should have a repeat chest radiograph because of
 the possibility of an 8-mm wide nodule in the left lung projecting over the
 fifth anterior interspace.
