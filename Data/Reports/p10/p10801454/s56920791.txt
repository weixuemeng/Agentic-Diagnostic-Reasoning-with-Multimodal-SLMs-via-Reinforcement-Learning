                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardic, hypotensive, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip is noted within the proximal right atrium.
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device leads terminate in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. 
 Patchy opacities within the lung bases, more so on the right, likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of support lines and tubes.
 2. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Early infection or aspiration is not completely excluded.
