                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with afib w/ rvr  // chf?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate right and small left pleural effusion.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  There is right perihilar opacity and bibasilar opacities,
 potentially atelectasis given adjacent effusions.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present without frank pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise normal.  The aortic arch is calcified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema.
 2. Right perihilar opacity could reflect pneumonia in the proper clinical
 setting.  Nonspecific bibasilar opacities potentially atelectasis, however
 underlying infection is not excluded.
