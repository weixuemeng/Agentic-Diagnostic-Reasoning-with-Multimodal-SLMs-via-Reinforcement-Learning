                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___
 and a CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 present.  However, there is a focus of consolidation in the left lower lobe
 that is new compared with prior and may represent a pneumonia.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not significantly changed from prior.
 Clips are seen in the upper abdomen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and
 bibasilar atelectasis. More focal consolidation in the left lower lobe might
 represent left lower lobe pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
