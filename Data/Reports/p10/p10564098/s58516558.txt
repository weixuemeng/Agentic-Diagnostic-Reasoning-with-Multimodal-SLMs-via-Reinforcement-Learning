                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and lower extremity edema.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The lung volumes are low but
 essentially clear except for minimal right basal atelectasis most likely
 related to high position of the hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
