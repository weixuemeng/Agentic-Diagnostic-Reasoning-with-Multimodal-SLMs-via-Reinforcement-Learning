                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fatigue and palpitations.  Question acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume but clear.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle could be related to an effusion.  Sternotomy
 wires and clips from a CABG are noted.  A metallic density is noted in the
 left upper quadrant.  Note is made of a calcified thoracic and abdominal
 aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Possible trace effusion on the right.
