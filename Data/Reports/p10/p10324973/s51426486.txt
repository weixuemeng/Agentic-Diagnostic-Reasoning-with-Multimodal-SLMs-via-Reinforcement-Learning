                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged, as before.  There is a patchy new opacity
 obscuring the left heart border, which is probably within the lingula and may
 represent a small focus of pneumonia.  It was not present on the prior
 examination but is small.  Nipple shadows are visualized bilaterally.  There
 is also a very small pleural effusion suspected on the right side, seen in
 both views.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new lingular opacity suggesting a small focus of
 pneumonia.  Trace suspected right-sided pleural effusion.
