                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post fall with right shoulder
 pain and history of right pleural effusion as of ___, is still
 there?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study dated ___.  There exists no previous
 chest examination as of ___.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.
 The configuration indicates an additional prominence of the left atrial
 appendage on the frontal view suggestive of moderate enlargement of the left
 atrium (clinical nodes include evidence of atrial fibrillation).  The thoracic
 aorta is mildly widened and elongated but does not show any local contour
 abnormality.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates again an upper zone
 redistribution pattern, similar as seen on the examination one year ago. 
 There is some mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses also visible in the
 posterior sinuses on the lateral view.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot
 be identified and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  A
 suspicious parenchymal infiltrate involving the left upper lobe lingula
 adjacent to the left lateral cardiac border cannot be seen anymore. 
 Comparison is extended to a chest examination of ___, at which
 time the heart size was slightly lesser than now.  Can also be observed that
 the pulmonary vasculature did not show the same degree of upper zone
 redistribution of the pulmonary circulation and the lateral pleural sinuses
 where completely free from any blunting at all.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate degree of cardiomegaly in patient with history of
 chronic atrial fibrillation.  Mild blunting of the pleural sinuses suggestive
 of mild degree of chronic CHF.  Stable cardiac and pleural blunting findings
 in comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___.
