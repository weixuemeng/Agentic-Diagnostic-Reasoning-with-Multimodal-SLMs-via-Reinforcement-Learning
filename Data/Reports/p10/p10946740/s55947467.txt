                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  On the ___ radiograph initially submitted for evaluation, the newly
 placed OG tube enters the stomach, and passes out of the field of view.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities attributable to either aspiration or pneumonia are not
 appreciably changed.
 
 This was discussed by telephone with the covering clinician.
