                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MVC with multiple rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar opacities are seen,
 which may represent a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis or
 hemorrhage in the setting of trauma.  The patient's known rib fractures are
 not well seen on this study.  Per the ED notes, the patient has an outside CT
 scan, which has not yet been uploaded for reference.  Cardiac silhouette is
 obscured by the bilateral opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may represent a combination of pleural fluid
 and consolidation or hemorrhage in the setting of trauma.
