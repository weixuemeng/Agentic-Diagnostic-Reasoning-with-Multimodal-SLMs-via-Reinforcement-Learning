 Following insertion of bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheters, which
 drained substantial volumes of pleural fluid, the lungs look substantially
 more clear, a phenomenon frequently observed where the presence of pleural
 effusions makes the lungs radiographically worse than actually are. There is
 still substantial bibasilar atelectasis.  I think the left lower lobe is still
 collapsed.  Heart is normal size.  ET tube and nasogastric tube are in
 standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PIC line is
 repositioned, previously in the low SVC, now ending at the level of the
 sternal notch it is probably in a small vein.
