                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs, most recent dating ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is upper
 lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature with widened AP diameter and
 flattened diaphragms suggesting underlying emphysema.  There is a subtle
 retrocardiac opacity which in the correct clinical setting may represent an
 early pneumonia.  The previously noted opacity in the left lower lung thought
 to represent a nipple shadow is again subtly visualized.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible early pneumonia in the left lower lobe.  Emphysema. 
 Subtle opacity in the left lung base which has been previously described on
 multiple chest radiographs for which dedicated chest CT is recommended on a
 non-emergent basis to exclude underlying mass.
