                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Kaposi sarcoma,
 baseline study.
 
 No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Nodular opacity is projecting
 adjacent to the left hilus, 9 mm in diameter.  No other discrete pulmonary
 nodules, masses, or consolidations demonstrated.  Comparison to prior studies
 is required.  If not available, chest CT would be necessary.
 
 The assessment of the lumbar spine demonstrates evidence of scoliosis as well
 as suspected wedge compression fracture at the lower thoracic vertebral body,
 chronicity undetermined.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
