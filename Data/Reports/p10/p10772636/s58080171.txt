                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rales bilaterally  // consolidation vs.
 pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 9:09 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large areas of consolidation have developed in the upper lungs, either
 posterior segments of the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes.
 Consolidation present earlier in the right lower lobe has increased.  Heart
 size is normal and mediastinal vessels have not dilated, so the findings are
 probably due to worsening pneumonia, particularly aspiration rather than
 pulmonary edema.  Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  Small pleural effusions
 are present.  There is no pneumothorax.
