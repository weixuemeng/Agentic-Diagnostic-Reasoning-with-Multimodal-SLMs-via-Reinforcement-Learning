                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT.  Evaluate placement of NGT?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two sequential portable radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which terminates at
 the level of the GE junction on the initial radiograph.  On the followup
 radiograph, the tube was advanced to at least the level of the duodenal bulb.
 A right PICC line is unchanged in position, terminating in the low SVC.  There
 is no pneumothorax. Unchanged obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm may
 be due to atelectasis or previous aspiration. However, there are increased
 airspace and interstitial right perihilar opacities with new bronchial wall
 thickening, which may reflect developing aspiration pneumonia.  An old healed
 left clavicular fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube terminates at the level of the proximal duodenum.
 
 New right perihilar opacity may reflect developing aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Stable retrocardiac airspace opacity, which may reflect previous aspiration or
 atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 8:37 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
