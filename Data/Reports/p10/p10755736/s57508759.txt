 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or appreciable pulmonary
 hemorrhage if any.  Right lung volume is larger now and aeration has improved
 at the left lung base, compared to earlier today.  These developments could be
 due to either pneumatocele formation, air trapping, or increase positive
 pressure ventilation, perhaps even improvement in the diffuse pulmonary
 abnormality.
 Heart size is normal.
