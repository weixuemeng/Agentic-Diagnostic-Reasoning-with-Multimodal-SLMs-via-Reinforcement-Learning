                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decompensated heart failure  // interval
 change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 07:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter
 unchanged in position.  There has been no interval change in the diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal process which could represent severe pulmonary edema,
 although pulmonary hemorrhage or a diffuse infectious process could have a
 similar appearance.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  There is likely a
 small layering left effusion.  Given the diffuse airspace process, assessment
 of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult.  No obvious pneumothorax.
