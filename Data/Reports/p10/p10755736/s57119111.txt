                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with likely CHF exacerbation  // CHF exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the region of the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  Multifocal bilateral pulmonary
 opacities have increased in the interval, which may be due to increased
 pulmonary edema or infectious process, on a background of chronic pulmonary
 opacities.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to increased pulmonary
 edema and/or infection overlying chronic pulmonary opacities.
