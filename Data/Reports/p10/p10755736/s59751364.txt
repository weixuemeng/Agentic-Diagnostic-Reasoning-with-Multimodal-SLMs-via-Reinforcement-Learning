                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COP  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Signal portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Extensive heterogeneous bilateral airspace opacities
 appear more confluent in the left mid to lower lung.  The right lung is also
 extensive involvement, but unchanged.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive heterogeneous bilateral airspace opacities, worse in the left lung,
 likely represent a combination of acute on chronic infection/inflammation. 
 The acute changes can also be produced by superimposed pulmonary edema.
