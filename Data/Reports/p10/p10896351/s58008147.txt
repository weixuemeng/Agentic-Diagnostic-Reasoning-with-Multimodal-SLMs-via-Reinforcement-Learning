                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with a pacer device in place.  Coarseness of interstitial markings
 could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure,
 or both.  Little change in the median sternotomy wires in this patient who has
 undergone a previous CABG procedure.
