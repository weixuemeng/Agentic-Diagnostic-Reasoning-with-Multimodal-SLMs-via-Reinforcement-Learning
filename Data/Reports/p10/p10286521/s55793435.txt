 There is interval development of substantial subcutaneous air and might be
 consistent with a combination of small present pneumothorax and potentially
 broken ribs, although definitive broken ribs demonstrated. Known left chest
 tube is present. There is resolution of previously seen left upper lobe
 atelectasis most likely consistent with suboptimal wall tool of the
 endobronchial valve. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema is seen.
