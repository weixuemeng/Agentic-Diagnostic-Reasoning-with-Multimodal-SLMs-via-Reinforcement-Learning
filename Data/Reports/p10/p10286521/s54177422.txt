 Compared to chest radiographs since it did ___, most recently ___
 through ___ at 08:22.
 
 Only the apical component of the previous left pneumothorax was diagnosable on
 conventional chest radiographs and that has resolved.  Because of the left
 upper lobe collapse due to the indwelling bronchial valves, the anterior
 mediastinum is shifted to the left of midline and on the lateral view
 simulates pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe and the right lung are clear of any
 focal abnormality.  There is no pleural effusion.
