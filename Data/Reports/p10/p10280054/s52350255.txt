                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.7 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the sidehole is
 above the esophagogastric junction.  Left subclavian catheter tip extends to
 the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 There is increased opacification again at the right base silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with a combination of layering effusion and
 compressive atelectasis at the base.  Prominent changes are seen on the left. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, aspiration or even infectious pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
