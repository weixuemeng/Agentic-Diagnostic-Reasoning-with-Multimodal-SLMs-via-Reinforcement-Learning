                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ years old man with respiratory failure, hypoxia and pneumonia,
 effusion, pneumothorax.  Please assess interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 3:40 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest x-ray, there are no interval changes. 
 Lung volume is still low with persistent right lung opacification, consistent
 with combination of consolidation and pleural effusion and compatible with
 pneumonia.  Unchanged left base opacity is likely atelectasis.  Left
 subclavian PICC is also unchanged with tip ending in mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No changes since prior chest x-ray.
