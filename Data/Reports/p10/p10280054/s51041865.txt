                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ years old man with traumatic head injury, failed
 extubation once, now extubated again, please evaluate interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  NG and ET tube have been removed.  Left subclavian PICC ends in
 lower SVC.  Lung volume is still low with interval increase of right lower
 lobe opacification for increased consolidation and pleural effusion and highly
 suspicious for pneumonia.  Linear atelectasis at the left lung base is stable.
 Diffuse increased opacity in the upper lobes is related to mild vascular
 congestion.  Heart size is minimally enlarged since prior CXR.  There is no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right base consolidation and pleural effusion is
 suspicious for pneumonia.   Mild vascular congestion is new.  ET and NG tube
 have been removed.
