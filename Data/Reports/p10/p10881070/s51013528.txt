                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post expiratory laparotomy, gastrojejunostomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are low lung volumes.  Right
 PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Small
 right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient and better inspiratory effort.  Left
 lower lobe atelectasis has minimally improved.
 
 Drains project in the right abdomen.  There are no new lung abnormalities or
 pulmonary edema.
