                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, post trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.9 cm from the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior border of
 the film.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  The hila are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the
 left, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine study.  No grossly
 displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in standard positions.
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis though
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
