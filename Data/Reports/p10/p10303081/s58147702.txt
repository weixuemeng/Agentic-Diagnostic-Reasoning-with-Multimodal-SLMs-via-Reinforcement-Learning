                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, to
 evaluate for acute pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lungs are clear, without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A linear opacity in the right lung base, is
 unchanged and likely represents scarring.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, with a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax is identified.  Cervical spine fusion hardware is
 partially imaged in this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
