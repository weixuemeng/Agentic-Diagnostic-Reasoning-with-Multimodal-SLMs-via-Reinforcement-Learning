                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent fall with dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 in the right perihilar region is a rounded opacity measuring 3.2 x 3.3 cm,
 grossly stable compared to prior.  The previously seen left mid lung rounded
 mass is not as well appreciated on the prior study but still appears to be
 present, measuring approximately 1.6 x 2.6 cm, although again not well seen. 
 There is patchy left base retrocardiac opacity.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 is calcified.  Single-lead left-sided pacer device is seen with lead extending
 to the expected location of the right ventricle.  The lateral view is slightly
 suboptimal due to some patient motion and overlying external artifact. 
 Partially imaged is the left humeral prosthesis.  Additional smaller pulmonary
 nodules may be present in the upper lobes bilaterally, as better appreciated
 on CT.  Lingular atelectasis/scarring is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings worrisome for left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Multiple pulmonary nodules again seen.
