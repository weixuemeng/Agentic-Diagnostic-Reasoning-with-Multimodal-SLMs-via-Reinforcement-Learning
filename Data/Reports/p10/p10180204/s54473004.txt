                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Prominence of the right hilum is new since the prior
 study.  There are bibasilar opacities with blunting of the costophrenic angles
 concerning for atelectasis with small effusions. Multiple large pulmonary
 nodule is again seen, grossly stable since the prior study, but better
 assessed on the prior CT chest.  Again seen is a left retrocardiac opacity,
 which now appears slightly larger and is obscuring part of the left
 hemidiaphragm. This likely represents a mass, seen on the prior CT in the same
 location, with a component of adjacent atelectasis, accounting for the slight
 increase in size. Single lead pacemaker is again seen with tip terminating in
 right ventricle. Left humeral prosthesis is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New bibasilar atelectasis and possible small pleural effusions.  
 
 2.  Multiple pulmonary masses again seen, including a mass in the left lower
 lobe which may have adjacent atelectasis. 
 
 3. Prominence of the right hilum, increased since the prior study.
