                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal linear left basal atelectasis is
 seen.  The heart is normal in size with tortuous and slightly calcified
 thoracic aorta.  Minimal right greater than left apical pleural thickening is
 noted with slight nodular component to the right apical pleura.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with apical pleural thickening
 more prominent on the right. This is statistically likely to reflect scarring;
 however it would be prudent to compare with previous examinations to document
 stability. If unavailable consider 3 month interval chest radiograph for
 further assessment. 
 
 This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by
 phone.
