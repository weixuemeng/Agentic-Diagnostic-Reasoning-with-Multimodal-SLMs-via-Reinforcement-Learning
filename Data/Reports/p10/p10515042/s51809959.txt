                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and questionable fevers on off.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle patchy right basilar opacity could relate to overlap of vascular
 structures and atelectasis although an early consolidation is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle patchy opacity projecting over the right lower lung on the frontal
 view, not well substantiated on the lateral view, may be due to overlap of
 vascular structures or mild atelectasis however, early consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
