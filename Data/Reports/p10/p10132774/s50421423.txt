                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F preop  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated, with possible mild background hyperinflation.  No
 CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are within
 normal limits, allowing for slight unfolding of the aorta.
 
 Cervical fusion hardware is noted, with degenerative changes noted in the
 lower cervical spine.  Note is made of rudimentary left-greater-than-right C7
 cervical ribs.
 
 Degenerative changes are seen at the left glenohumeral joint.  Narrowing of
 the acromial humeral distance on the left raises the possibility of rotator
 cuff thinning and/or tearing.  Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral
 joint cannot be excluded, but, if present, are probably less pronounced than
 on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process detected.
