                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  There are low lung
 volumes.  The patient's body habitus also leads to underpenetration.  The low
 lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  However, there may be
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely in part accentuated by the low lung volumes and AP
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 However, there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
