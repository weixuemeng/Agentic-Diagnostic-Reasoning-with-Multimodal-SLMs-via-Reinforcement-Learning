                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // evaluate for PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has slightly progressed compared to the prior
 exam from ___.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 Diffuse bilateral increased parenchymal opacities are likely secondary to mild
 pulmonary edema vs. air-trapping. There may be small bilateral pleural
 effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In conjunction with the CT performed on the same day, the diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal abnormality may be secondary to mild pulmonary edema vs diffuse
 air-trapping.  No evidence of a pneumothorax.
