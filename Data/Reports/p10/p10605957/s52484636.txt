  1. No evidence of cardiac decompensation.
  2. Significant cardiomegaly, in the absence of vascular congestion or overt
  pulmonary edema, suggests cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  If there is
  persistent clinical concern, echocardiography for further evaluation could be
  considered.
  3. Focal opacity at the right costophrenic angle, potentially atelectasis or
  small effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // r/o chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There is no focal airspace consolidation, effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Allowing for
 differences in technique, moderate cardiomegaly has increased and is now
 substantial.  In the absence of pulmonary vascular congestion or signs of
 cardiac decompensation, this could indicate cardiomyopathy or pericardial
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of cardiac decompensation.
 2. Significant cardiomegaly, in the absence of vascular congestion or overt
 pulmonary edema, suggests cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  If there is
 persistent clinical concern, echocardiography for further evaluation could be
 considered.
 3. Focal opacity at the right costophrenic angle, potentially atelectasis or
 small effusion.
