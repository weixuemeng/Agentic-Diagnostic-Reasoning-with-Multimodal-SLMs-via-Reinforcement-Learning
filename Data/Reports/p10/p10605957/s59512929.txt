                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with three day history of fever.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.  Focal opacity at the
 left costophrenic angle is likely secondary to atelectasis.  The heart size,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 without pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Colonic
 interposition between the right hemidiaphragm and the liver is identified.  No
 free subdiaphragmatic air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
