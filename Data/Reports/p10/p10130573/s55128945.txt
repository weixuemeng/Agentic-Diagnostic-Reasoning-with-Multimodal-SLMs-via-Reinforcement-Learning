                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with seizures and new fever, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph is obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 and nasogastric tube have been removed.  New pulmonary opacities are seen in
 the bases bilaterally with accompanying small right pleural effusion.  In the
 setting of a seizure history, these findings could reflect aspiration, though
 pneumonia in the appropriate setting is an alternative explanation.  Heart is
 normal.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bibasilar opacities could reflect aspiration given the
 seizure history, though in the appropriate clinical setting could also reflect
 developing multifocal pneumonia
