                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion is new or increased, partially obscuring the
 right lung base. Small region of pneumonia or even a small lung mass could be
 present. I would repeat chest radiographs in several weeks including both
 oblique and decubitus views to see if there is enough concern for such an
 abnormality to warrant CT scanning.
 
 There is no left pleural effusion. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.
