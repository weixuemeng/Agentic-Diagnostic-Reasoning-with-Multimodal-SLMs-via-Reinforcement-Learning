                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:
 Comparison is made to chest radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right pleural effusion is increased since the prior study, with associated
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, and obscuration of the lateral
 right hemidiaphragm. Otherwise, the lungs are clear, with no focal
 consolidation or over pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable, and the heart is top-normal in size. Partially
 visualized lumbar spine fusion hardware is noted.
 
 In the posterior lateral right upper quadrant, an irregularly marginated
 densely calcified mass measuring approximately 3.2 x 2.2 cm is noted, not
 significantly changed dating back to the most remote available imaging from ___ chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Moderate right pleural effusion.
 2. 3.2 x 2.2 cm calcified mass, likely benign given its stability since ___, in the posterior right hepatic lobe is possibly a calcified
 hemangioma, echinococcal cyst, or old abscess cavity.
