                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature is
 consistent with pulmonary engorgement.  The presence of mild interstitial
 Kerley B lines is consistent with mild interstitial edema.  Small amount of
 pleural effusion is demonstrated on the left, new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, overall improved since the prior study. 
 Small new but minimal amount of pleural effusion.
