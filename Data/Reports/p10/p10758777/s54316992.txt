                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with myelodysplastic syndrome and diastolic
 heart failure, who presents for evaluation of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be an increase in the right-sided interstitial
 edema as well as a prominence of the azygos shadow which may be suggestive of
 increased venous filling pressure.  There is also a small right pleural
 effusion.  There is has been a slight interval increase in the size of the
 patient's heart.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval increase in pulmonary edema likely secondary to worsening diastolic
 heart failure.
