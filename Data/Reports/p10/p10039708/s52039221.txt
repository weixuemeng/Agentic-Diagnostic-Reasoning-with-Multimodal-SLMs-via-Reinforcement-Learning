                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress today, pneumothorax
 seen on CXR  // any interval change in pneumothorax?      any interval change
 in pneumothorax?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen,
 consistent with severe pulmonary edema more prominent on the right. 
 Coalescent opacification at the right base could reflect superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
