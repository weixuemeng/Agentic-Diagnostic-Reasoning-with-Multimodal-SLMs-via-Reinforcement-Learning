 confirm dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:15
 
 FINDINGS:

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip projecting over
 the expected location of the stomach.  The right internal jugular central
 catheter and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles likely reflects small effusions.  Lungs are grossly clear.
 No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
