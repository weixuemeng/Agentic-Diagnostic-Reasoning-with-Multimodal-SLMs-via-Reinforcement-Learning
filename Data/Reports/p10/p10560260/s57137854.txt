                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  Given this limitation, there is no focal
 consolidation.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No pleural effusions
 are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study given poor inspiratory effort.  No acute cardiac or
 pulmonary process.
