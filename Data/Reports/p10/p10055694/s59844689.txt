                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New shortness of breath with history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is moderately enlarged, but
 the cardiac silhouette is obscured due to the presence of a moderate-to-large
 right pleural effusion with right basilar compressive atelectasis.  Mild
 pulmonary edema appears relatively unchanged compared to prior study.  No
 left-sided pleural effusion is visualized.  There is no acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, slightly increased from
 prior, with right basilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema, unchanged.
