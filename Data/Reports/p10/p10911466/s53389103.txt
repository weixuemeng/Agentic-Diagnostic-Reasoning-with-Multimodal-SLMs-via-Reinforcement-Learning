 Comparison to ___.  The previous left large basolateral

 replaced by a relatively widespread parenchymal opacity.  The left
 costophrenic sinus, however, still remains blunted.  The true extent of the
 process, in particular of the pleural component, is better appreciated on the
 lateral than on the frontal view.  No new focal parenchymal opacities. 
 Constant size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
