                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status in the setting of prior liver transplant. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___ and earlier chest radiographs from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The pulmonary interstitium is slightly
 prominent bilaterally, which suggests slight mild congestion or fluid
 overload.  In addition, the lateral view depicts a posterior opacity
 projecting over the lower lobes, which is difficult to visualize on the
 frontal view, but is suspected to relate to the left lower lobe, noting new
 mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which may suggest volume
 loss.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex
 curvature of the thoracic spine is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting slight fluid overload or pulmonary congestion.
 
 2.  Vague posterior opacity suspected to reside in the left lower lobe with
 indication of volume loss.  Although the films are not optimal particularly
 noting substantial soft tissue attenuation, the possibility that this may
 represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting should be entertained,
 but it is probably also compatible with atelectasis and volume loss.
