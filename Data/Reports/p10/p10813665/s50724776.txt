                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, unknown etiology.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Status post sternotomy.  NG tube courses throughout the mediastinum to its
 expected location in the stomach.  The ET tube is in good position, lying
 about 4 cm above the carina.
 
 There is a right-sided internal jugular line in unchanged position.  There is
 symmetrical blunting of both costophrenic sulci.  Generalized increased lung
 markings consistent most with fluid overload are grossly unchanged.
 
 More confluent abnormalities in the left lung base in particular are also
 unchanged.  I note also CT from ___ suggesting this and in fact very
 little fluid overload, so presumptively the changes represent the ongoing
 alveolitis-type changes identified on that radiograph.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Little interval change from prior study.
