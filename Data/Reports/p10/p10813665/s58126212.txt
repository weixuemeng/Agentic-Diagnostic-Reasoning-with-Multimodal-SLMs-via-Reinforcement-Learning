                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent intubation, question position of ET
 tube and OG tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  AP radiograph from ___ as well as multiple other
 priors.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an ET tube 5.1 cm from the carina.  An OG tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Since the most recent prior
 radiograph, there has been interval worsening of bilateral diffuse parenchymal
 opacities, most pronounced in the right upper and lower lung zones.  Again
 seen is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
 with atortuous aorta.  Median sternotomy wires are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 5.1 cm from the carina.  OG tube in the stomach.
 2.  Slight worsening of bilateral parenchymal opacities, particularly on the
 right, likely worsening pulmonary edema.
