                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Check placement of Swan-Ganz catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed 8:05 a.m. the same day.
 
 Single AP view of the chest performed at 12:55 p.m. is submitted.
 
 Compared to the prior study, a Swan-Ganz catheter has been inserted, the tip
 of which is likely in the right atrium.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is
 in good position, 4.3 cm above the carina.  Tip of the NG tube projects beyond
 the edge of the film in the stomach.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion
 and redistribution, slightly improved since the prior study.  Compared to the
 prior study, linear opacity at the right base has improved as well consistent
 with improved atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter appears in the right ventricle. 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in good position.
