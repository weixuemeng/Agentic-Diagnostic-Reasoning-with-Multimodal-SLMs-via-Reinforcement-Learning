 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There are bilateral right greater
 than left perihilar, perihilar opacities which may reflect asymmetric edema
 although superimposed infectious process is not excluded.  Given history of
 hemoptysis by presenting care the patient, underlying pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also not excluded.  Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, most likely due to small pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
