 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previous right lung base airspace opacity has nearly completely resolved
 leaving minimal residual opacities, which may be due to mild scarring.  This
 opacity is not definitely seen on the lateral radiograph. There are no new
 consolidations or pleural effusions. The heart and mediastinum are within
 normal limits. Regional bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantially improved right basilar opacity, likely reflecting resolving
 pneumonia.
