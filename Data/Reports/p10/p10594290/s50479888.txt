                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with planned for stem cell transplant admitted w/
 fever neutropenia  // now with hypoxia eval for pneumonia or pulmonary edema  
 now with hypoxia eval for pneumonia or pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lung volumes are lower contributing to the apparent increasing caliber of
 mediastinal and pulmonary vessels.  There is no pulmonary edema, or
 cardiomegaly.
 
 Given low lung volumes it is impossible to distinguish small pneumonia in the
 lingula from new atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is likely.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Right internal jugular catheter ends in the low SVC.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs, obtained at maximal
 inspiration, if feasible.
