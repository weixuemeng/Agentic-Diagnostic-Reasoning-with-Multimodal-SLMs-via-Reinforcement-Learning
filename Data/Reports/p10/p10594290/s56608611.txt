                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fevers, cough, and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Ring-like opacities are noted diffusely within the right
 upper and mid lung fields as well as within the left lung base likely
 reflective of diffuse bronchiectasis with airway wall thickening.  Adjacent
 patchy opacities may reflect regions of infection.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bronchiectasis, most pronounced in the right upper and mid lung fields
 in left lung base, with airway inflammation and adjacent patchy opacities
 suggestive of infection.
