 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  No confluent consolidation is identified to

 is evident.  The thoracic aorta is densely calcified, though appears normal in
 caliber.  There is no pneumothorax.  Rightward scoliosis of the spine is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No aspiration or pneumonia.
