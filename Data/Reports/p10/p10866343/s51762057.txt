 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated. 
 Patchy opacities noted in the right lung base.  This could reflect atelectasis
 but infection is not excluded.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.  Remote
 left-sided rib fractures are noted.  Extensive degenerative changes of the
 left glenohumeral joint are partially imaged.

 Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
