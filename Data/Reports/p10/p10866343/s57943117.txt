                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Slight irregularity of the posterior
 lateral left 9th rib likely due to prior fracture.  Expansion of the distal
 right clavicle is seen, not well evaluated, correlate for history of prior
 trauma at this site 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Clear lungs.  No pulmonary edema.  Possible prior fracture of the posterior
 lateral left 9th rib.  Expansion of the distal right clavicle, not well
 evaluated, correlate for history of prior trauma at this site.
