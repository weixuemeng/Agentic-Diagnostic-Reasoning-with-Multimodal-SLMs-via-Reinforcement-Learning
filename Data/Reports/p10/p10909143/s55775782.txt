                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fungal endocarditis and CVAs with new
 wheeze.  // Acute pulmonary process?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___, apparent mediastinal widening is likely due to
 accentuation of a tortuous thoracic aorta by a rightward patient rotation, but
 should be confirmed by a repeat nonrotated radiograph when clinically
 feasible.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for new pulmonary vascular congestion
 and interstitial edema as well as possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
