 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain presenting for the evaluation prior to the OR.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from___.
 
 FINDINGS: A single frontal portable view of the chest was performed.  There is

 new from the prior study.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.

 abdomen is grossly unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: New opacification of the left low lung raises concern for possible
 aspiration.
