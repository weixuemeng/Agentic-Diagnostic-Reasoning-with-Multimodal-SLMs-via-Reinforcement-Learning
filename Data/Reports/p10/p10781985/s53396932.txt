                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with left upper back pain  // rule out infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Tracheostomy tube
 is identified.  There is persistent relatively streaky left basilar opacity. 
 This may correlate with a linear opacity projecting over the fissure on the
 lateral view and could represent atelectasis or scarring.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity most likely atelectasis or scarring.  No definite
 superimposed cardiopulmonary process.
