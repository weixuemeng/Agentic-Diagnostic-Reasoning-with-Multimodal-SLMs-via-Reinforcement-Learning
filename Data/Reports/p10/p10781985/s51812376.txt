                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HD steroids, tracheostomy, GNR bacteremia, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The tracheostomy is apparently radiolucent.  A right IJ line is present, tip
 at SVC/RA junction.  Clips noted in left neck, unchanged.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  The aorta
 is calcified and slightly unfolded.  There is patchy retrocardiac opacity,
 worse compared with ___ at 17:01 p.m., and minimal atelectasis at the left
 base.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is
 borderline upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Probable background
 hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity and left base atelectasis, new compared with
 ___.  The possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.
