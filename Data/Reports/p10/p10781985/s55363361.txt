                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are
 mildly hyperinflated.  Patchy and linear left basilar opacities likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Fusion hardware within the lumbar spine is partially
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar patchy and linear opacity, likely atelectasis.  Infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
