                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with gastric volvulus  // Confirm NG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed the same date at outside facility.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright radiograph through the chest demonstrates intact median sternotomy
 wires.  Surgical clips project over the left upper mediastinal border.  An
 enteric tube descends in the thorax in a uncomplicated course, its tip which
 projects over the left upper quadrant in the presumed location of the gastric
 lumen.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  No opacity convincing for pneumonia is present.  Streaky
 opacity at the left lung base is most consistent with atelectasis.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube ends in the lumen of the upper stomach, below the diaphragm.  No
 acute intrathoracic abnormality.
