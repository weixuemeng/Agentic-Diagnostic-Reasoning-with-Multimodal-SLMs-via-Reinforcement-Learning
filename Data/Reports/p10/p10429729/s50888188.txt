 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with stage IV cancer with inability to tolerate
 p.o.  Question esophageal stricture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Left chest wall port is
 seen with catheter tip in the upper right atrium.  Surgical chain sutures
 project over the right lung apex.  There is increased soft tissue density in
 the right hilar and suprahilar regions.  The lungs are otherwise clear without
 focal consolidation, effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased soft tissue density in the right suprahilar and right
 paramediastinal region for which clinical correlation is suggested
 (post-treatment changes such as radiation?) noting that underlying parenchymal
 changes or adjacent adenopathy in the setting of malignancy is possible.
