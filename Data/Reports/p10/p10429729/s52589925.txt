                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung ca, p/w dysphagia, found
 to have tracheoesophageal fistula, s/p esophageal stent ___  // pulmonary
 infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient is still extubated, ET tube tip just below the thoracic inlet in
 standard placement. The large esophageal stent has not migrated. Heterogeneous
 peribronchial opacification in the left lower lung on ___ has improved.
 This could be due to improvement in any aspiration of esophageal contents
 following esophageal stenting. Enlarged right hilus may be smaller although
 right perihilar infiltration remains the same. Small right pleural effusion is
 new or slightly larger. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
