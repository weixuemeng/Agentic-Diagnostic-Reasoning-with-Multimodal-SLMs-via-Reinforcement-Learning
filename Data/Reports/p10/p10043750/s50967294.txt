                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with bradycardia
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are extremely low. 
 Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may be atelectasis. 
 Additionally, there are numerous dilated loops of small bowel within the upper
 abdomen which could be related to postoperative ileus given patient's recent
 right hemicolectomy, though bowel obstruction is also within the differential.
 If clinical situation is worrisome, dedicated abdominal imaging is
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Extremely low lung volumes with basilar opacities, right greater than
 left, possible atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  
 
 2.  Dilated small bowel in the upper abdomen.  Possible ileus or obstruction. 
 Consider dedicated abdominal imaging for assessment.
