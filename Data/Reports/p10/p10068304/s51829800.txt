                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with CHF, dyspnea, evaluate for effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical
 clips.  Aortic arch calcifications are again noted.  There is stable mild to
 moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, including prominent soft
 tissue density in the region of the azygous vein.
 
 Opacification of the lower left lung likely relates to subsegmental relaxation
 atelectasis in the setting of a small left pleural effusion.  Bandlike
 atelectasis is also noted at the right lung base medially.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle without frank effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.  Slight asymmetry of
 the hemi thoraces is suggested, with the left lung apex lying above the right.
 The right hemidiaphragm is probably slightly elevated, but not significantly
 changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  Increased
 soft tissue is again noted in the region of the azygous vein.
 2. Small right and possible small left effusion.
 3. Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation.
