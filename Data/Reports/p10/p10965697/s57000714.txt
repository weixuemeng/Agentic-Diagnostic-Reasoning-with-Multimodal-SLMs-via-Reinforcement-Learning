                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with acute myelocytic leukemia and
 neutropenia found to have questionable pulmonary edema versus early PCP
 pneumonia on imaging.  Radiology recommended chest x-ray in order to follow
 upper lobe pathology.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  A previously existing
 left-sided subclavian central venous line has been removed.  The described
 right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position and terminates in the
 lower SVC.  Heart size and appearance of thoracic aorta unchanged.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is noted and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Previously
 existing patchy parenchymal infiltrate in the right lower lobe area has
 clearly decreased in size with only a locally persisting crowded pulmonary
 vasculature in the right lower lobe posterior segment can be identified.
 
 During this one-month examination interval, the patient has undergone four
 chest CT examinations on ___, ___, ___ and ___.  The final CT made note of slow progression of the right middle lobe
 central located infiltrate diagnosed as scattered nodular densities in the
 upper lobe areas.  The present comparison of chest examination shows clear
 significant regression of the density corresponding to the right middle lobe
 infiltrate.  The nodular densities seen on CT are not readily accessible on PA
 and lateral chest examination.  One can, however, state that no significant
 new abnormalities are seen in this area.
