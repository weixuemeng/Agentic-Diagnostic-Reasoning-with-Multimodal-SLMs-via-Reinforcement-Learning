                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: hx of latent TB Aspergillus pneumonia, spike of fevers.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 14:26 p.m.
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded.  No
 CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.   Within the limits of plain
 film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, calcified
 granulomas, or apical fibronodular spurring is identified.  There are probable
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine, not well evaluated on these films.
 There does appear to be superior endplate scalloping of the presumptive T7
 vertebral body, slightly more pronounced on the chest radiograph dated
 ___. 
 
 Compared with the most recent prior study, I doubt significant interval
 change.
