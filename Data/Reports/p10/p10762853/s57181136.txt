                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is
 persistent patchy left mid lung opacity that appears decreased, suggesting
 improvement in atelectasis, although there is probably still some degree of
 volume loss noting mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Projecting over the lower right mid lung is a new nodular focus that appeared
 over the short interval so this is probably due to an area of minor
 atelectasis with a nodular appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.  However, there is a new nodular focus in the
 right lower lung, likely a form of atelectasis; short-term follow-up
 radiographs are recommended to show resolution.
