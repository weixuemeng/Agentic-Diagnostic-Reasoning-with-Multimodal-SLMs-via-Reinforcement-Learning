                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath asthma  // eval for pna 
 pnx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest and chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted, left greater than right.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle may be secondary to atelectasis versus a trace
 effusion.  There is no convincing lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
