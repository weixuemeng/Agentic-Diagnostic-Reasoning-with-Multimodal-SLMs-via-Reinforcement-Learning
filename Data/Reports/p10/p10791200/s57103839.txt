                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Low oxygen saturation, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are somewhat low with linear densities in the lower lungs likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  No definite consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable and normal.  The bony structures appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild linear atelectasis in the lower lungs.  No definite evidence
 of pneumonia.
