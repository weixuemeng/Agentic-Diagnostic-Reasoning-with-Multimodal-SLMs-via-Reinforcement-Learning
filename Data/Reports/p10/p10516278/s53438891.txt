                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bilateral
 hilar prominence is present and appears symmetrical.  The lungs and pleural
 surfaces are clear.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral hilar prominence, which could reflect prominent
 pulmonary vasculature or symmetrical hilar lymph node enlargement such as may
 be encountered in sarcoidosis.  Comparison to older chest radiographs would be
 helpful to determine long-term stability.  In the absence of older chest
 x-rays, contrast-enhanced CT could be considered to further assess the hilar
 structures if warranted clinically.
