                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or volume overload, in a patient with
 hypoxemia and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, with the heart top-normal in size.  Lung volumes
 are improved from the day prior.  Bilateral opacities are improved compared to
 ___, consistent with resolution of pulmonary edema.  Persistent
 lingular opacity could represent overlying costochondral cartilage versus a
 consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  There is trace, if any, pleural
 fluid bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved aeration of the bilateral lungs and resolution of pulmonary edema
 compared to chest radiographs from 2 days prior.
 2. Persistent lingular opacity could represent overlying costochondral
 cartilage versus a consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  Continued
 monitoring with chest radiograph is recommended.
