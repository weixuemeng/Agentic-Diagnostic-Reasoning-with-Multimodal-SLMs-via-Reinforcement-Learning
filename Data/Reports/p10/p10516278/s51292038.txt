                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M c hx lymphoma, on chemo, renal failure, p/w fever. 
 // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with mild central vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema, slightly improved since the prior study. Linear left lower
 lobe atelectasis. A subtle, left retrocardiac airspace opacity may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Metallic embolization coils are noted overlying the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and central vascular congestion. Left lower lobe and
 retrocardiac airspace opacities likely reflects atelectasis, although
 underlying infection is difficult to exclude.
