                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Post-cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about
 2.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet to the
 hemidiaphragm, probably in the distal esophagus.  A left internal central
 jugular venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  The heart
 appears mildly rounded and perhaps enlarged.  There is a pleural effusion on
 the left, probably small-to-moderate in size, with retrocardiac opacification,
 including air bronchograms, which is non-specific but often seen with
 atelectasis, although potentially aspiration or pneumonia could be considered.
 The right costophrenic angle is partly excluded, but visualized right lung
 fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided pleural effusion and patchy retrocardiac
 opacification.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Orogastric tube
 terminating probably in the distal esophagus.
