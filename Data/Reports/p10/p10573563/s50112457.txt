                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal
 contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob with
 a tortuous aortic contour.  There is no mediastinal widening.  The lungs are
 clear of consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no large pleural
 effusion; subtle blunting of the posterior aspect of the left costophrenic
 angle may represent trace pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace left pleural effusion, but otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
