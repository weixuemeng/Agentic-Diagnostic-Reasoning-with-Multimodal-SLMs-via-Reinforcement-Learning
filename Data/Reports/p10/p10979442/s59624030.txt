 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, AP AND LATERAL:  Patient positioning is suboptimal.  Lungs are
 hyperexpanded, with flattening of the hemidiaphragms and widening of the
 retrosternal clear space/anteroposterior diameter.  Lung volumes are low, with
 discoid atelectasis in the right mid lung.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  There are no pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 No free air is seen under the diaphragm.  Thoracic hypokyphosis is present. 
 There is posterior fusion hardware in the lower thoracic and lumbar spines,
 with continued fracturing at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes and chronic obstructive airways disease.
 2.  Chronically fractured thoracolumbar fusion hardware.
