 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Pre-existing areas of atelectasis and
 small pleural effusions at the lung bases have completely resolved.  A
 platelike atelectasis remains visible at the left lung base.  There is a known
 rounded perihilar opacity on the left that is completely unchanged.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elongation of the descending aorta.
