                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sudden onset respiratory distress and
 hypoxia while receiving IVIG  // flash pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable view of the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis and likely small left
 pleural effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema is identified. There is no
 pneumothorax.  The right PICC terminates in the low SVC, as before, and right
 humeral head anchor devices. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  A
 geographic opacity in the left midlung is again seen
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural
 effusion. No overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Left midlung opacity could conceivably be a pleural plaque given geographic
 appearance, however in the setting of ARDS, parenchymal consolidation due to
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
