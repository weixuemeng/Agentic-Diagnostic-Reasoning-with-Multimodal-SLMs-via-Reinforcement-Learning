                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with colitis, COPD, now with worsening SOB and
 rhonchi on exam.  // Possibility for PNA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hip central venous line tip is at the level of mid to lower SVC. Heart
 size and mediastinum are unchanged. But there are new bibasal opacities, most
 likely representing aspiration although atelectasis or developing infectious
 process is in on the possibility.  Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion
 is present. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 More dense opacity that is projecting sometimes at the level of the hilus and
 sometimes be low might potentially be outside of patient chest or within the
 pleura, and most likely represents benign finding.
