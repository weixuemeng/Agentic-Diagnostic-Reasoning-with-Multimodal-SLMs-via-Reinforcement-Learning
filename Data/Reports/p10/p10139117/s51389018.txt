                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fatigue and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a large left upper lobe mass with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
 mild mediastinal widening.  The mass could have slightly increased in size as
 compared to the previous image.  New, however, is an ill-defined zone of
 parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, located in the peripheral areas
 of the right lower lobe.  Moreover, subtle opacities have newly appeared in
 the lung parenchyma at the level of the left lower lobe.  The of distribution
 and morphology of the opacities is highly suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.
 
 No other relevant change.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.  A
 minimal left pleural effusion present, based on the lateral radiograph.
