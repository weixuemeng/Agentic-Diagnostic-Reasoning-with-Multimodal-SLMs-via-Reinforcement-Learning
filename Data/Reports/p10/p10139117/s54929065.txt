                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue, weakness, lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Known left upper lobe
 mass is grossly stable.  Left basilar opacity is seen with obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation or disease spread is not excluded.  The previously more focal
 right basilar opacity is less dense; however, there continues to be patchy
 opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung which may be due to multifocal
 infection and/or mass suprahilar.  Left costophrenic angle is blunted and a
 small left pleural effusion is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with grossly stable
 known left suprahilar mass.  Obscuration of left hemidiaphragm may due to
 underlying consolidation; however, there may also be a possible pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Right mid-to-lower lung opacities are less
 confluent as compared to the prior study; however, remain concerning for
 infection.
