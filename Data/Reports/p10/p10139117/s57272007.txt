 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:33 AM
  1. Opacity at the left lung base, likely representing atelectasis but cannot
  exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
  
  2. 4.5 cm mass in the left upper lung consistent with known history of lung
  cancer.
  
  3. Emphysema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy with wheezes and crackles on lung
 exam, patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer please evaluate for
 possible pneumonia or effusion.  // History: ___M with lethargy with wheezes
 and crackles on lung exam, patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer
 please evaluate for possible pneumonia or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.  Comparison is made with chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest CT from ___ and chest
 radiographs from ___ and in ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lung is well expanded and there is an elevated left hemidiaphragm,
 similar prior exam.  There is a 4.5 cm mass in the left upper lung, slightly
 increased in size from prior and consistent with known history of lung cancer.
 Diffuse interstitial markings which could represent chronic interstitial
 disease, lymphatic spread of tumor, or mild pulmonary edema. An opacity is
 seen at the left lung base, likely representing atelectasis although cannot
 exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. Elevation of
 left hemidiaphragm makes evaluation of the cardiac silhouette difficult, but
 the heart is likely somewhat enlarged.
