                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncopal episode, history of lung cancer with
 recent lobectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral view of the chest compared to prior chest x-ray from
 ___ and chest CT from ___.  Postoperative changes of
 left upper lobectomy are seen with left hemithorax volume loss and elevation
 of the hemidiaphragm as well as surgical chain sutures in the suprahilar
 region.  There is increased nodular opacity in the postoperative bed, which
 was more clearly delineated by recent CT as suspicious for recurrent disease. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Findings again suspicious for
 recurrent disease abutting the surgical chain sutures of the left upper
 lobectomy.
