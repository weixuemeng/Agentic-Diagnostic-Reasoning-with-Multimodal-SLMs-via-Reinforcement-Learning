                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of COPD, lung cancer and multifocal pneumonia.  Evaluation
 for interval change.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is a large left upper lobe mass with elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm, largely unchanged from the prior study.  Multiple small nodules
 and coarse reticulations particularly in the right lower lung are concerning
 for metastases with lymphangitic extention. The previously seen pulmonary
 edema is improved. no pleural effusions are seen and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Multiple, disseminated lung nodules are presumably metastases, 
 
 2. Improved pulmonary edema.
