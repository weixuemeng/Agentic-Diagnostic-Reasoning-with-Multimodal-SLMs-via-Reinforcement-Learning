                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Worsened peripheral areas of consolidation in the periphery of the
 right mid and lower lung are concerning for evolving pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Superior segment left lower lobe lung mass is
 similar compared to the prior study as well as left apical thickening and
 postoperative volume loss in the left lung.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and
 mild-to-moderate edema have worsened in the interval.  There are probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions, but no pneumothorax is evident.
