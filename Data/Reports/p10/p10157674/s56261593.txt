                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, tachycardia. hx of CA on chemo  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated group ___, CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.  Prominent bilateral
 hila are noted, corresponding to lymphadenopathy seen on recent CT.  Since the
 prior examination, there is a left basilar opacity.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Clips are seen in the right axilla.  Linear
 radiopaque density projecting over the right supraclavicular region,
 presumably external.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left basilar opacity since the comparison examination could be
 atelectasis though pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical context.
