                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB for the last 8 days.  // Infection or
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Trace pleural effusion in the right
 costophrenic sulcus vs suboptimal inspiration. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small opacification in the right lung may represent trace pleural effusion or
 it may potentially be due to suboptimal inspiration.  If clinically warranted,
 examination may be repeated with emphasis on inspiration.
