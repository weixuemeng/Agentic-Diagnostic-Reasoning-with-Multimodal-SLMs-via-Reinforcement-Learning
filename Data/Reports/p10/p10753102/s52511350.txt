                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right VATS wedge resection with recent chest tube
 removal, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 08:33. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is been interval removal of the right basilar chest tube with no
 definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  The appearance of the chest is otherwise
 unchanged with mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 prominent with slight rightward deviation of the trachea by the aortic knob,
 which appears stable.  Lucencies adjacent to the trachea in the upper
 mediastinum likely reflect a distended, air-filled esophagus.  A retrocardiac
 fluid level on the lateral view corresponds to a hiatal hernia.  The imaged
 upper abdomen demonstrates gas-filled loops of bowel. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Removal of right basilar chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.
