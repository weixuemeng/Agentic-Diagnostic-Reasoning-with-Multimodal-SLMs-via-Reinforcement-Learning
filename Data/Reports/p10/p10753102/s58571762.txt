                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post VATS wedge resection. 
 Study requested for evaluation of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and prior chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 dilation of the azygos vein and increased pulmonary congestion.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
 Relative hyperlucency of the entire right hemithorax could be due to prior
 right mastectomy. A right basal pleural tube extends from the lateral costal
 surface to the posterior aspect of the chest. There is no pneumothorax. The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  Increased lucencies adjacent to the trachea likely
 represent distended esophagus.  There is also marked distention of the
 stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased pulmonary congestion, no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Unchanged, minimal bilateral pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
