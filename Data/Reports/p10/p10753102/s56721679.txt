                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right lower lobe
 wedge resection.  Assessment for interval change.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ chest CT as well as several prior radiographs.  
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance with central position. 
 The left lung is unremarkable.  Post-surgical changes in the right lung are
 redemonstrated.  In addition, there is new or more conspicuous right
 subpleural opacity, not clearly seen on the prior study, approaching 3.8 x 1.6
 cm, similar with obtuse angles toward the pleura and most likely represent
 pleural effusion and less likely rounded atelectasis.  Attention to this area
 on the subsequent radiographs is recommended.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
