                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged and its size has increased since the remote
 prior radiographs.  Central pulmonary vessels are enlarged with upper zone
 redistribution, and in addition, mid lungs show mild hazy opacification,
 probably a true finding even allowing for soft tissue attenuation.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.
