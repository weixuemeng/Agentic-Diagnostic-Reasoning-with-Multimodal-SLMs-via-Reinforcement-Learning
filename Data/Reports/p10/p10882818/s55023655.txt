                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bladder cancer, on chemotherapy, who now
 presents with fever and cough; evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT scouts and cross-sectional images dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated with slight increased AP diameter of the chest,
 unchanged.  Subtle increased opacity in the right infrahilar region on only
 the frontal view may represent overlap of superimposed structures or
 atelectasis; however, aspiration and/or early bronchopneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.  The left lung is clear.
 No pleural effusion, edema, or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  Biapical mild pleural thickening/scarring is
 unchanged.  Mild atelectasis and/or scarring at the left costophrenic angle is
 also unchanged.  Dextroconvex scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine is
 unchanged.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle increased opacity in the right infrahilar region probably reflects
 superimposed normal structures and/or atelectasis.  However, early
 bronchopneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.
 
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs with widening of AP diameter compatible with history
 of chronic pulmonary disease.
