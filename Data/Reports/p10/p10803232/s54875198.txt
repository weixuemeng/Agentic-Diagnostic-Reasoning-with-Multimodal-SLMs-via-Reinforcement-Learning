                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased SOB  // pneumothorax, pleural
 effusions?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18 24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation, and patchy opacity at the right base, with possible
 small right effusion. Patchy opacity at the right base has increased slightly
 compared with the prior film. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. CHF with interstitial edema, probably very slightly increased compared with
 ___. Slight increase in patchy opacity at the right base. Findings
 at the bases could all relate to CHF, with effusions and atelectasis, but an
 associated pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
 2. No pneumothorax detected.
