                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right sided chest pain, post-thoracentesis
 // pneumo?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 08:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is a new or significantly increased small to
 moderate left effusion, with underlying left base collapse and/or
 consolidation. Small right effusion and patchy right base opacity is similar
 to the prior film. Overall CHF findings appear slightly worse, with increased
 vascular plethora and slight vascular blurring. Vague opacity in the right mid
 zone is similar to the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 somewhat larger. While this may in part be accentuated by a TECHNIQUE, I
 suspect that there has been some interval cardiac enlargement. No obvious
 pneumothorax, but the possibility of a tiny right apical pneumothorax cannot
 be entirely excluded.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New or significantly increased left effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 2. Mild worsening of CHF findings. Possible slight interval cardiac
 enlargement.
 3. Persistent small right pleural effusion and right base atelectasis and
 right midzone opacity.
 4. No definite right apical pneumothorax. The possibility of a tiny right
 apical pneumothorax is considered unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded.
