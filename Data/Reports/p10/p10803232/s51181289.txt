                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased SOB  // pleural effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier the same date, left pleural
 effusion has decreased in size and moderate right pleural effusion is
 unchanged. Asymmetrically distributed parenchymal opacities have partially
 improved on the left and likely represent a combination of multifocal
 pneumonia and edema.
