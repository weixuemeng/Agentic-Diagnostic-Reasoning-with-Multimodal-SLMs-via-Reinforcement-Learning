                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, persistent oxygen requirement.
 Evaluate for intrathoracic process such as effusion, edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ from an outside facility,
 ___, and uploaded onto PACS.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  The opacity in the right
 lower hemithorax likely reflects a combination of the small right pleural
 effusion, atelectasis, and edema, slightly increased from the prior exam.  A
 small amount of fluid tracks in the minor fissure, slightly increased from the
 prior exam.  No large left pleural effusion.  The heart is severely enlarged,
 overall unchanged. The descending aorta is perhaps slightly tortuous or
 ectatic. Aortic knob calcifications are unchanged. No pneumothorax.  The
 extensive multilevel degenerative changes in the visualized thoracic spine are
 noted.  The bones appear diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate edema, atelectasis, and small right pleural effusion.
