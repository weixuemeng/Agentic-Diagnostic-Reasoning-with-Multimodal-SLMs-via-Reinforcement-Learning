                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diastolic heart failure, history of pleural effusion, evaluation
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a probably loculated right pleural effusion, a small left pleural effusion
 that is restricted to the left costophrenic sinus.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pulmonary edema.  However, at the
 right lung base, an indistinct parenchymal opacity is visually more obvious
 than on the previous image.  The opacity is also seen on the lateral view and
 could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  Close followup is required.
