                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diastolic congestive heart failure with chronic pleural effusions,
 recent weight gain weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Moderate
 size right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged compared to the prior
 study with a trace left pleural effusion also again noted.  There is worsening
 opacification in the right lung base, which could reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is also be
 demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size right and small left pleural effusions.  Worsening opacification
 in the right lung base could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection
 is difficult to exclude.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.
