                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  Cardiac enlargement persists.  No change in
 configuration.  Unaltered appearance of moderately widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta.  As before, there is evidence of bilateral pleural effusions
 blunting the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses and obliterating the
 diaphragmatic contours.  The distribution of the pleural effusion on the right
 base has changed slightly, raising the possibility that pleurocentesis has
 been performed during the interval.  There appears some mild improvement of
 aeration of the right lower lobe lung areas, but no new pulmonary pathology
 can be identified.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
