 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:54 AM
   It is possible that there is subtle increased density projecting over the
  region of the manubrium which could represent the retained oral contrast seen
  on CT, but this is not definitive. With overlying densities, including bone,
  and dilution of contrast for CT, the contrast may not be readily apparent on
  radiography. Bilateral pleural effusions, left inferior chest tube, and
  enlargement of the cardiac silhouette are better evaluated on recent CT. These
  findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 3:45 a.m. on ___ at
  time of wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion, status post
 pleurodesis, now with contrast from the CT stuck in the upper esophagus. 
 Please assess.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is also made to prior CT scan from ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, right side
 worse than left.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity.  There is faint if any
 density projecting over the mid upper esophagus.  This could correlate with
 the retained barium seen in this location on the prior CT scan; however, it is
 better assessed on the CT.  There is no pneumothoraces.  These findings have
 been discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___.
