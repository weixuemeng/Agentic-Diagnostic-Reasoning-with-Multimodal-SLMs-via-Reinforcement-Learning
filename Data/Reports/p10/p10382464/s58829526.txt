  1. Unchanged position of left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with the leads
  terminating in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.
  
  2. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle could relate to small
  right-sided pleural effusion.
  
  3. Prominent right hilum, could be secondary to lymphadenopathy. Further
  evaluation with CT can be considered.
  
  Findings discussed with ___ team via telephone on ___ at 11:00 AM.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea. Question acute cardiopulmonary disease, migration of
 pacer wires.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual chamber pacemaker remains in unchanged position with wires
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, expected location and
 unchanged since ___. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Prominence of the
 right hilar region is likely secondary to patient's positioning. Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle could relate to a small amount of pleural
 effusion. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Unchanged position of left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with the leads
 terminating in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 2.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle could relate to small
 right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Prominence of right hilum, is secondary to patient positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  FInding #3 discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 5:18 PM.
