                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post placement of a pacemaker, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is the unchanged position of a dual-chamber subclavian
 pacemaker seen in place, with leads identified within the right atrium and
 right ventricle. Note that the prior report mistakenly described the pacemaker
 lead to be within the left atrium. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Mild bilateral pulmonary edema is noted.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion seen.  The mediastinal contours are grossly
 normal.  No bony abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged position of a dual-chamber pacemaker with leads in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  No evidence of associated pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly.
