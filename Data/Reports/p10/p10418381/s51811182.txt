 patient is status post median sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderate-to-severely enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy opacity projecting over the left
 costophrenic angle may relate to overlying soft tissue, although a pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Small right pleural effusion is also difficult
 to exclude.

 silhouette.  Difficult to exclude small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.
