                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 455 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with HFP, possible pneumonia versus
 hemorrhage.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 5:15 a.m. is submitted.
 
 The right costophrenic angle is not entirely included on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Patchy opacity in the left mid
 to lower lung is again seen and represents an area of pneumonia or pulmonary
 hemorrhage.  Atelectasis would be less likely given the lack of interval
 change.  The right lung remains grossly clear.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  No large effusions.
