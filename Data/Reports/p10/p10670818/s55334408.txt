 As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are
 constant.  In addition to the pre-existing large right basal parenchymal
 opacity, the patient has developed extensive left parenchymal opacities.  The
 time course of the changes is suggestive of massive aspiration or developing
 atelectasis.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices, unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
