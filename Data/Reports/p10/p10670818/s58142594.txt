 The enteric tube terminates beyond the diaphragm.  Right internal jugular
 central venous line terminates at the approximate superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are
 unchanged.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has slightly improved.  Heart size and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Patchy perihilar opacities particularly
 on the left are concerning for developing pneumonia.
