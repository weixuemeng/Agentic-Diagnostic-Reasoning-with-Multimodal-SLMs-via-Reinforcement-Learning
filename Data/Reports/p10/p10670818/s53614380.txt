                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p R nephrectomy w/ SBO s/p ex lap, LOA, transverse
 colectomy and SBR, mult re-explorations for leak and open abdomen and bleeding
 now w/ ileostomy and mucus fistula s/p tube cholecystostomy, repeat wash out. 
 // fluid effusion vs PNA    fluid effusion vs PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume
 loss in the left lower lobe with possible small effusion.  There is suggestion
 of some increase in patchy opacification at the right base.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could represent developing pneumonia. 
 However, this also could be a manifestation of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
