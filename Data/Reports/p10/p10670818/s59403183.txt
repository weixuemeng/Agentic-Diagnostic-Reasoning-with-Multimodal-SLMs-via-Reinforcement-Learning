                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Ex-lap, SBR, with pleural effusions  //
 Please assess interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been negligible interval change.  Again
 seen is the vascular plethora and blurring, consistent with CHF;  right base
 pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation; and increased
 retrocardiac density.  Equivocal small left effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Right breast prosthesis again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change.
