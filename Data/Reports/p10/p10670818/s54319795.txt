 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying stomach.  There is hazy opacity at
 the right base, which could reflect a small layering effusion, with underlying
 atelectasis and/or consolidation.  There is a very small left effusion, also
 with left base atelectasis and/or consolidation.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 No CHF.
 
 Residual oral contrast noted in the hepatic flexure.  2 clips noted over the
 upper abdomen in the midline.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragm on this
 semi-erect portable view.
 
 There is subtle focal irregularity along a lower right rib laterally, question
 the right eighth rib, raising question of a nondisplaced rib fracture.
