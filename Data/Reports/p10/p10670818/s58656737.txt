 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p R nephrectomy w/ SBO s/p ex lap, LOA, transverse

 is difficult to visualize but appears to be in the proximal SVC.  There are
 persistent bilateral predominately perihilar airspace opacities with hazy
 pulmonary vascular consistent with pulmonary edema.  Unchanged left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax seen.
