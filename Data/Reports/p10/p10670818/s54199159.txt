 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated.  The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carina. Normal course
 of a new nasogastric tube.  New right internal jugular vein catheter, the tip
 projects over the low SVC.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.  Minimally increased lung volumes likely reflect ventilation. 
 Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left.  Minimal fluid
 overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
