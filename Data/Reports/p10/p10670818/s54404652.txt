 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  The side port of the nasogastric tube again is at or
 above the gastroesophageal junction, and the tube should be advanced if
 possible for at least 5 cm for more optimal placement.
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Some indistinctness in
 pulmonary vessels suggests mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.
