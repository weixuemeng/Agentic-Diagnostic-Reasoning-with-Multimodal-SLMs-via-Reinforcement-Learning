                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 Opacity projecting over the left lung base, possibly involving a rib, is more
 prominent compared to prior  On the lateral view, prominent costochondral
 calcification is seen; however, the inferior aspect of the sternum, while not
 well assesssed, appears mottled and heterogeneous.  Given history of prostate
 cancer, findings could relate to metastases.  Recommend further evaluation
 with cross-sectional imaging or bone scan.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  An area of relative increased opacity at the left lung base could
 in part relate to prominent costochondral calcification.  This is more
 prominent as compared to ___ with the sternum appearing relatively
 mottled and heterogeneous on lateral view of chest, given history of prostate
 cancer, metastasis is in the differential and further evaluation with
 cross-sectional imaging or bone scan is recommended.
