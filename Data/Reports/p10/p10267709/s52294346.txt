                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aspiration, patient intubated, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest provided.  There has been
 interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip situated 2.1 cm above the
 carina.  The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.  There is
 bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis/aspiration accounting for perihilar
 opacity in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is no significant change
 from prior study aside from tube placement.
