                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute mental status change.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Numerous prior chest radiographs, the most recent ___,
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are very low with vascular crowding in the perihilar
 regions.  There is some increased density in the left retrocardiac region and
 the right infrahilar region, most likely atelectasis, although infection
 cannot be excluded.  The heart is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  There are intact median sternotomy wires and surgical clips
 projecting over the mediastinum.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Very low lung volumes limit evaluation.  Left retrocardiac and right
 infrahilar streaky opacities may be atelectasis, although underlying infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
 2.  The heart is top normal size, but exaggerated by low lung volumes.
