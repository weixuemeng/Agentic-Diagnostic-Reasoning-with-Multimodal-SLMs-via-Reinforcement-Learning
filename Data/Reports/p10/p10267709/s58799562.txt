                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  CHF/pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted.  Lung volumes are low markedly low limiting
 assessment.  Allowing for low lung volumes, there is no convincing evidence
 for pneumonia or edema.  Hilar congestion difficult to exclude.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly within
 normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam without overt evidence for pneumonia or edema.  If there is
 further concern, a repeat is recommended with more optimal inspiratory effort.
