                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  There may be mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, which may be exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Evaluation of
 heart size is suboptimal in the setting of low lung volumes.  Mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Post-surgical changes are again noted. 
 Osteopenia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
