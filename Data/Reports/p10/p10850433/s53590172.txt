 INDICATION:  Status post thoracentesis for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:03.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  Previously seen moderate left pleural
 effusion has significantly decreased and there is now just a small left
 pleural effusion, adjacent atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Left lower
 lobe atelectasis, reexpansion edema or pneumonia.

 amount of left pleural fluid remaining.  Adjacent opacity may represent
 reexpansion edema, pneumonia or atelectasis.  Recommend attention on followup.
