 thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:43.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable appearance of the chest
 with persistent near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with a
 small lucent area in the upper left lung.  The right lung remains clear with
 no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A catheter projects over the mid
 left hemithorax which could be external to the patient but could represent a
 PleurX catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Stable appearance of the chest status post thoracentesis with persistent
 near complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely a combination of
 effusion and atelectasis.
 
 2. A small bore catheter projects folded over the left chest.
