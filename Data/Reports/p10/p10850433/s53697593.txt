                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with decompensated liver failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:  
 
 I think that a ___ x 23 mm wide rectangular opacity projecting over the left
 mid lung at the level of the fourth anterior rib is a superimposition of
 normal structures, including costal calcification, but I can't be sure. 
 Shallow oblique views would be very useful.  Lungs are low in volume but
 otherwise relatively clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is no evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.
