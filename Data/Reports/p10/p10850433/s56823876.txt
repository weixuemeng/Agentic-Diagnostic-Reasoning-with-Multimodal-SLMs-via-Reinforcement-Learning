                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, ascites, status post tube placement.  Assess for
 hydrothorax following tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 prior to tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent though substantially decreased left pleural effusion is
 moderate in size.  Opacities projecting over the now visible left mid lung and
 right lower lung likely reflect residual atelectasis.   Visible
 cardiomediastinal and right hilar contours are unchanged. Stable healed right
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial interval decrease in left pleural effusion, now
 moderate in size. Opacifications projecting over left mid lung and medial
 aspect of the right lower lung likely reflect atelectasis.
