                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with large left effusion, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion is still present.  There is only minimal aeration
 in the left upper lung.  Basal left pigtail catheter is again noted.  Air
 bronchograms suggest the presence of collapse.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is still midline.  There is no right pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis has minimally increased.
