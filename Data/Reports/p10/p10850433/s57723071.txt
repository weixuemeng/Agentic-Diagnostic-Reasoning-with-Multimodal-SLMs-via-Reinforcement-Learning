                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pleural effusion has increased and now the left hemithorax is
 almost entirely opacified with a small lucent area in the upper left lung as
 well as a vague lucency at the left lung apex.  These findings could be seen
 with small areas of residual aerated lung, although not well evaluated on
 chest radiography.  Retrocardiac air bronchograms are visible suggesting
 opacified lung, probably extensive atelectasis.  The opacified left hemithorax
 bulges rightward with substantial new rightward mediastinal shift.  However,
 the right lung remains clear, without pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete opacification of the left lung with rightward
 mass effect suggesting marked increase in a pleural effusion.  The possibility
 of malignancy should be considered in addition to sequelae of cirrhosis.
