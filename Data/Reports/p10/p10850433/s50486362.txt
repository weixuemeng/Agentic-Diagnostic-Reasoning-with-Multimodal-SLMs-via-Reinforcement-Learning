 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is again a large pleural effusion occupying the mid-to-lower
 hemithorax with rightward mass effect although it is likely that the left
 lower lobe and parts of the left upper lobe, at least the lingula, are
 collapsed.  The right lung remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A prior
 healed right posterior lateral seventh rib fracture appears unchanged.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar large left-sided pleural effusion.
