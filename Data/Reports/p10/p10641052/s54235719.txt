  suboptimal exam-pt rotated to the left. ETT ~ 5.6 cm above carina. left mid to
  lower lung opacity with ? Lward med shift(pt also rotated in that direction),
  new since prior, raises concern for underlying partial collapse of the left
  lung. perihilar opacities are also new since OSH CXR 2 hrs prior, concern for
  pulm edema rather than infxn given short term development.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated at outside hospital with fever of unknown
 origin.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:38 at___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  This exam is
 suboptimal as the patient is rotated to the left.  Suggest repeat with better
 patient positioning.  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5.6
 cm above the level of the carina.  Perihilar opacities are seen, new since the
 prior study two hours prior, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than infection
 given short-term development.  There is left mid to lower lung opacity and
 retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The
 mediastinum may also be shifted to the left, although this is difficult to
 truly discern since the patient is rotated in that direction as well.  The
 constellation of above findings may relate to partial left lung collapse.
