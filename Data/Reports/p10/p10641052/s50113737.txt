 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:52 AM
  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of
  the carina.  The patient is in better position as compared to prior study. 
  There are low lung volumes.  Left base opacity may relate to effusion and
  atelectasis, though underlying consolidation may be from aspiration and/or
  infection may be present.  There is also right basilar opacity which could
  also relate to aspiration and/or infection depending on the clinical context. 
  The mediastinum is widened.  If there is concern for mediastinal injury, chest
  CTA should be considered.  Pulmonary edema persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ET tube placement, question of collapse of left lower
 lobe, and interval change in left lung.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:25 and outside hospital radiographs today,
 ___ at 17:38.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of
 the carina.  The patient is in better position as compared to prior study and
 the mediastinum no longer appears shifted.  There are low lung volumes.  Left
 base opacity may relate to effusion and atelectasis, though underlying
 consolidation may be from aspiration and/or infection may be present.  There
 is also right basilar opacity which could also relate to aspiration and/or
 infection depending on the clinical context.  The mediastinum is widened.  If
 there is concern for mediastinal injury, chest CTA should be considered. 
 Pulmonary edema persists.
