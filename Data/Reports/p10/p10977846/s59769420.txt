                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fall with hematoma
 at the back of head.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient's chin obscures the lung apices, particularly the right lung apex,
 obscuring the view.  There are low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic,
 making evaluation for subtle fracture suboptimal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute fracture is seen, although if concern for rib
 fracture is high, suggest rib series.
