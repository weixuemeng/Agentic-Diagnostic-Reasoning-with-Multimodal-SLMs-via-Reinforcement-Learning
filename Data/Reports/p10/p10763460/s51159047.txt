                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including dextro-positioning positioning and cardiomegaly.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  There is a prominent epicardial fat pad.  The chest appears
 hyperinflated.  Coarse lung markings appear unchanged and reflect emphysema. 
 There is no focal opacity.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus
 appears unchanged and accordingly most likely reflects minor scarring or
 atelectasis rather than an effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with emphysema but no evidence of acute
 disease.
