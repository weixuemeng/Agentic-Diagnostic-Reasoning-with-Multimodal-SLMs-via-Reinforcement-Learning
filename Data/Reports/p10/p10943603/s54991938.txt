                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Acute dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph is obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 is seen with its tip located approximately 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 courses into the left upper abdomen.  Diffuse bilateral ground-glass
 opacities, which are most compatible with pulmonary edema.  A right pleural
 effusion is noted, moderate in volume.  There may be a tiny left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size difficult to evaluate though
 is at least top normal.  Widening of the mediastinum is likely due to supine
 portable technique.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes appropriately positioned. 
 Pulmonary edema with moderate right and tiny left pleural effusion.  Top
 normal heart size.
