 positioning.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is greater in the perihilar
 right lung than the left.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Heart is
 moderately enlarged.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
  Viewed prospectively, it would be difficult to exclude concurrent right
 pneumonia, however subsequent chest radiograph, performed 08:54 on ___, but
 available the time of this review shows clearing of both edema and the right
 perihilar confluence, as well as a improvement in cardiomegaly.
