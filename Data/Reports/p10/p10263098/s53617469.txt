                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath and fever, history of pneumonia and
 CHF in the past
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  Moderate pulmonary edema appears worse in the
 interval with small left and moderate size right pleural effusions.  More
 focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Assessment of the lung apices however is somewhat limited by
 the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with moderate size right and small left pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
