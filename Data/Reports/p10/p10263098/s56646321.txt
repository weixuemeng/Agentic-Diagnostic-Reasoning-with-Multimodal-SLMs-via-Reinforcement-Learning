                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, leukocytosis, fever; h/o positive AFB
 culture  // Any evidence of pna, findings c/w TB infection?      Any evidence
 of pna, findings c/w TB infection?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A skin fold projecting over the left lateral chest should not be mistaken for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 possibly mild pulmonary edema.  Heterogeneous appearance of the lower lungs
 particularly the right could be due to chronic lung disease, but would make it
 difficult to detect early pneumonia.  There is no pneumonia in the upper
 lungs.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.
 
 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Pneumonia could be excluded with greater certainty if
 evaluated with conventional radiographs or CT scanning.
