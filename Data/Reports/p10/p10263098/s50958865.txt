                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMH of ESRD s/p failed renal transplant in
 ___ on HD, DM, PVD, HTN, CHF, Afib, recent admission for HCAP and
 Enterococcus bacteremia, p/w clotted fistula and altered mental status. Now
 more hypoxic.  Evaluate for worsening pulmonary edema or consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.  AV
 fistulogram of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a stent graft in the left cephalic arch,
 described on the recent fistulogram.
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, pulmonary edema is severe and persistent. 
 Increasing right lower lobe opacification may be in part positional, however a
 suspected right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis has worsened. 
 Superimposed infection is not excluded in this region.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion is trace, if any.  No change in the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Severe persistent pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increasing right lower lobe opacification is likely due to increasing
 right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  However, superimposed
 infection is not excluded on the basis of chest radiograph.
 
 3.  Interval placement of a stent graft in the region of the left cephalic
 arch, described on the recent fistulogram.
