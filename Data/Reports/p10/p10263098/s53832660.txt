                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/dyspnea, crackles in left base and diminished in right,
 febrile, please eval for PNA  // ___M w/dyspnea, crackles in left base and
 diminished in right, febrile, please eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates mild
 cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema, with slightly improved aeration of
 the right mid to low lung compared to ___.  Slightly more focal
 opacity in the left mid lung with sparing of the left costophrenic angle could
 also represent pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded
 in the right clinical setting.  There are bilateral pleural effusions,
 moderate to large on the right and trace the small on the left.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  Slightly more focal opacity in the left mid lung
 with sparing of the left costophrenic angle could also reflect pulmonary
 edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical
 setting.
