                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ as well as a CTA chest
 from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low.  Mild linear opacity at the left lung base is most compatible
 with atelectasis.  The lungs appear otherwise clear without signs of pneumonia
 or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is stable
 and within normal limits.  Aorta is slightly unfolded with atherosclerotic
 calcifications along the knob.  Bony structures appear intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
