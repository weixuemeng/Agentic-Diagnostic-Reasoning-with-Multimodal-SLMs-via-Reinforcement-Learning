                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent upper respiratory infection, complaining of shortness of
 breath at rest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a slight interstitial abnormality with peribronchial
 cuffing, but somewhat less prominent.  This could be seen with slight fluid
 overload or pulmonary vascular congestion, but inflammation of lower airways
 or perhaps infection could also be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Moderate osteophytes are noted along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interstitial abnormality, perhaps reflecting vascular
 congestion versus an inflammatory or potentially infectious process involving
 lower airways, but improved.
